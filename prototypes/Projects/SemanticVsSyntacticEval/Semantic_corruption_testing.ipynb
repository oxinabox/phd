    "I have a prototype of they system for corrupting sentences, for different semantic meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "My process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the sentence (Currently using the NLTK regex tokenizer, it seem sufficient)\n",
    "2. Parts of Speech tag (Currently using the Stanford POS Tagger (via NLTK))\n",
    "3. For each word that is not blacklisted (I have blacklisted \"had\", \"were\", \"have\", \"was\", and \"be\", as they are unusual verbs with strange antoymns, further more the are rather syntatic)\n",
    "        1. Use WordNet to find antonyms of the same POS tag  (So \"race\" (Noun, as in a competition) has no antonyms, but \"race\" (Verb, to race the train) has \"linger\" as an antonym.\n",
    "        2. Unstem: WordNet stemming/lemmaisation (of the antonym) removes Tense, Plurality, comparativeness, and superlativeness, so I make use of the POS tag of the original to work those out, then restore them using the Pattern library's tools for this (http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/desmedt12a/desmedt12a.pdf)\n",
    "        3. I remove any suggested antonyms that are short phrases (eg Wordnet suggests that \"take_away\" is an antonym of \"add\", however as adding a work word change the structure of the sentence.)\n",
    "        4. select one randomly if there are multiple.\n",
    "4. I incrementally subsitute one addional antynym until I have run out of words with antonys, saving the sentence at each step. (What I'm currentl;y callign each sentence of different corruption level)\n",
    "5. I repair the indefinite articles ('an' vs 'a')\n",
    "\n",
    "I can check the final sentence by sending it through the POS tagger and seeing if I get the same tags.\n",
    "This is not perfect. Its not bad though.\n",
    "It got a lot better when I changed to using the Stanford POS tagger, as it was more able to tag and retag correctly and thus was most consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole method is very heurustic.\n",
    "It's not too bad but makes a lot of unnatural sounding sentences.\n",
    "And will sometimes choose the wrong antonym.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example stating with the sentence:\n",
    " - It's not too bad but makes a lot of unnatural sounding sentences.\n",
    " - It 's not too unregretful but makes a lot of unnatural sounding sentences.\n",
    " - It 's not too unregretful but makes a lot of unnatural devoicing sentences.\n",
    " - It 's not too unregretful but makes a lot of unaffected devoicing sentences.\n",
    " - It 's not too unregretful but makes a lot of unaffected devoicing acquittals."
