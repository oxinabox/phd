      "Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .\r\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\r\n",
      "Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .\r\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\r\n",
      "Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .\r\n",
      "Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\r\n",
      "The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\r\n",
      "The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .\r\n"
