Hyponym Generation Dataset
===================================

This is a hyponym generation dataset, created using WordNet (Miller, 1995).

The first word on each line is a hypernym, followed by all its hyponyms. Given the hypernym, the system needs to automatically find all the hyonyms from an open vocabulary.

While WordNet terms are annotated with only the closest hyponyms, we are considering all indirect/inherited hyponyms to be relevant -- for example, given relations (genomics -> genetics) and (genetics -> biology), then genomics is also regarded as a hyponym of biology. WordNet relations are defined between synsets, but we refrain from the task of word sense disambiguation and count word A as a valid hyponym for word B if it is valid for any sense of B.

Synonymy can be thought of as a symmetric is-a relation, and most real-world applications would require synonyms to also be returned, together with hyponyms. Therefore, in our dataset we consider synonyms as hyponyms in both directions.

To construct the dataset, we first found all single-word nouns in WordNet that are contained at least 10 times in the British National Corpus (BNC). Next, we retained only words that have at least 10 hyponyms, such that they occur 10 or more times in the BNC. This selection process aims to discard WordNet hypernyms that are very rare in practical use, and would not have enough examples for learning informative vector representations. The final dataset contains the remaining terms, together with all of their hyponyms, including the rare/unseen hyponyms.

In order to better facilitate future experiments with supervised methods, we randomly separated the data into training (1230 hypernyms), validation (922), and test (922) sets.
