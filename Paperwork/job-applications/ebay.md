I was pleased to from Sharam at ACL about how closely the research tean wirjs wuth the engineering team.
I think that is very important.
I have a strong dislike of siloing.

>    Research and stay up-to-date with state of the art in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. Publishing is strongly encouraged.


> Requirements

>    PhD in Computer Science (Natural language processing) or Master in Computer Science plus several years of research experience

Yes


>    Deep experience in statistical and/or neural machine translation

Not experience.
I am familar with the many of the techniques, but my research has been on NLP, not machine translation.
I don't have practial experience implementing machine translation.
I would need to get up to speed on that.
I know a lot transfers.

Yes, see my book

>    Excellent collaboration skills

Yes, see my open source collaborations on github

>    Engineering background using Java and/or C++, as well as script languages such as Perl, Python, etc.

Yes, I worked in C# and Java at Bankwest.
I know java, and some C++ from Uni; also C.
I prefer working in Python (or Julia), I've used Perl a few times -- it is surprisingly useful for making diagrams.



>    Skilled in looking for and finding innovative ways of delivering results, accomplishing goals through technology, etc.




>    Ability to lead a significant research project and successfully drive from idea to impact

see every paper i've written.
My advisors were very hands off; I devised the problems and the solutions.
They gave me advice largely on paper writing and how to explain things.
And occationally on things like evaluation methods.

>    Successful research track record, focused on natural language processing and machine translation

See my research track record.
