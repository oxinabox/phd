.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBwheretotrim\fR is a tool to help LaTeX users reduce their document's
page count.  It is intended to be used with documents that exceed a
publisher's specified page-length limitation by a small amount (much
less than a full column or page).  \fBwheretotrim\fR operates by building
the document repeatedly, successively expanding each column on each
page by one line height to mimic reducing the amount of text in that
column by an equivalent amount.  If doing so does not reduce the page
count, \fBwheretotrim\fR repeats the process with two line heights'
expansion of each column, then three, and so forth until it expands
each column in turn by the full height of the column.  The following
is some sample output:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    To reduce the page count from 10 to 9, do any of the following:
\&
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 2 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 10, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&
\&    Note: 12 lines = 2.4" = 6.1 cm = 26.8% of the column height
.Ve
.PP
That is, reducing either column on page\ 9 or the first column on
page\ 10 by 12 lines is the most expedient way to reduce the
document's page count.  More than 12\ lines would need to be cut on
other columns and other pages to achieve the same effect.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
\&\fBwheretotrim\fR accepts the following command-line options:
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-allpages\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --allpages"
Perform enough extra runs of \fBlatex\fR to report the amount of space
that must be trimmed from \fIeach\fR column or page to reduce page count,
not just the columns or pages to which the page count is the most
sensitive.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Display the output of each run of \fBlatex\fR.  This is useful for
troubleshooting and to help monitor the progress of long \fBlatex\fR
runs.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Suppress progress updates and output only the final report.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIpage\fR,\fIcolumn\fR,\fIlines\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR=\fIpage\fR,\fIcolumn\fR,\fIlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d page,column,lines, --debug=page,column,lines"
Debug \fBwheretotrim\fR's execution by expanding page \fIpage\fR, column
\&\fIcolumn\fR by \fIlines\fR line heights and leaving the \fBlatex\fR output in
that state.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Summarize usage information and exit.  These may be used with
\&\fB\-\-verbose\fR to display more extended documentation.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Display \fBwheretotrim\fR's version number and exit.
.PP
In addition to the preceding options, \fBwheretotrim\fR requires a
\&\fIlatex command\fR argument that specifies how to build the document.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
For the most basic usage, simply provide a \fBlatex\fR command to run:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wheretotrim latex myfile.tex
.Ve
.PP
or, for example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wheretotrim pdflatex myfile.tex
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBwheretotrim\fR executes the specified command a large number of times
and finally terminates with a report resembling the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    To reduce the page count from 10 to 9, do any of the following:
\&
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 2 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 10, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&
\&    Note: 12 lines = 2.4" = 6.1 cm = 26.8% of the column height
.Ve
.PP
To ask \fBwheretotrim\fR to report how much space needs to be trimmed on
each column and page to reduce the total page count, specify the
\&\fB\-\-allpages\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wheretotrim \-\-allpages latex myfile.tex
.Ve
.PP
The output now looks like the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    To reduce the page count from 10 to 9, do any of the following:
\&
\&      * Reduce page 1, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 1, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 2, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 2, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 4, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 4, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 5, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 5, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 6, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 6, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 7, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 7, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 8, column 1 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 8, column 2 by 13 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 9, column 2 by 12 lines.
\&      * Reduce page 10, column 1 by 12 lines.
\&
\&    Note: 12 lines = 2.4" = 6.1 cm = 26.8% of the column height
.Ve
.PP
If you're curious how the document managed to shrink substantially as
the result of a relatively minor text reduction, you can typeset the
document with a particular page and column enlarged by a given amount:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wheretotrim \-\-debug=9,1,12 latex myfile.tex
.Ve
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
\&\fBwheretotrim\fR hooks into LaTeX's output routines, which are
notoriously arcane and somewhat fragile.  As a result, it is quite
likely that \fBwheretotrim\fR will fail to analyze a large set of
documents.  Use the \fB\-\-verbose\fR flag to help identify any problems
that \fBlatex\fR encounters.
.PP
In many cases, \fBwheretotrim\fR will recover by simply ignoring a few
possible page and column expansions.  For example, certain expansions
may result in a \f(CW\*(C`Float(s)
lost <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fllost>\*(C'\fR message.
In other cases, \fBwheretotrim\fR will fail to analyze any modification
to the document.  For example, it may receive an \f(CW\*(C`Infinite glue
shrinkage found in box being split\*(C'\fR error from every page and column
variation it tries.  In this particular case, see the discussion at
<http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/>.
.PP
When \fBwheretotrim\fR is used with a \fBlatex\fR auto-build script you may
need to take measures to force the script to rebuild the document even
if it appears that no files have changed.  For example, \fBlatexmk\fR
should be given the \fB\-CF\fR option to force rebuilding:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wheretotrim latexmk \-CF myfile.tex
.Ve
.SH "RESTRICTIONS"
.IX Header "RESTRICTIONS"
\&\fBwheretotrim\fR is implemented as a Perl script with an auxiliary LaTeX
package.  It has been tested only on Linux, but I suspect that it
should also work on \s-1OS\s0\ X.  I doubt it will work under Windows,
though, due to the way the script uses a \fBbash\fR\-specific technique
for redirecting the standard error device into the standard output
device.
