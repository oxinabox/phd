Description
===========

wheretotrim is a Perl script and auxiliary LaTeX package that helps
LaTeX users reduce their document's page count.  It is intended to be
used with documents that exceed a publisher's specified page-length
limitation by a small amount (much less than a full column or page).
wheretotrim reports the page and column on which the least amount of
text needs to be trimmed to reduce the page count.  It works by
repeatedly rebuilding the given document, analyzing the benefit of
trimming from each column or page one line of text, then two, then
three, and so forth until the document's page count decreases.

wheretotrim has been tested only on Linux.  It might work on OS X.  It
probably won't work on Windows.


Installation
============

To create wheretotrim.pl and wheretotrim.sty simply run "tex
wheretotrim.ins".  Rename wheretotrim.pl to wheretotrim and install it
somewhere in your path.  Install wheretotrim.sty somewhere where LaTeX
can find it.  See
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages for
general information about installing packages.
