  Abstract                 = {A general non-parametric technique is proposed for the analysis of a complex multimodal feature space and to delineate arbitrarily shaped clusters in it. The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance},

Erratum
The authors of the article ”Frame-Semantic P
arsing” and a graduate student discovered
that in rows 7 and 8 of Table 8, at inference time for argument identification with
gold frames, the described model included gold spans along with the candidate set
of automatic spans (elaborated in Section 6.1), thus creating an oracle, and artificially
bloating the precision, recall, and F
1 metrics. The revised metrics are:
Naive decoding: Precision=78.65 Recall=72.85 Fscore=75.64 (row 7)
Beam search decoding: Precision=80.40 Recall=72.84 Fscore=76.43 (row 8)
This unintended artifact also changes the
interpretation of Table 9. The reported
results there should be interpreted as an oracle comparison of various inference
methods, that uses both automatically extr
acted candidate spans as well as gold spans
for argument identification.
None of the other results in the article are affected by this error.},

Parses sentences into AMR, using graph techniques.
Stuff being done in this is pretty neat.


Evaluation is two steps:
 - Mapping words to concept nodes, done with a linear feature scoring
 - Mapping Relationships to edges (or rather fdereminging when realtiuonship edges exist), done with a maximum spanning subgraph alorigthm which maxised the scrores from a different linear features scoring.


Both feature scorers much be trained.
For the word to concept mapping a "Automatic Aligner" is used to know which concepts (in AMR space), align to which words. That is to say the auytomatic aligner is used to determine the ground truth from the training data (of sentecnec paired wit their AMR rep) to which the concept mapping is trained to replicate.},

One of the most underutilized features in extractive summarization is rhetorical information - semantically cohesive units that are hidden in spoken documents. We propose Rhetorical-State Hidden Markov Models (RSHMMs) to automatically decode this underlying structure in speech. We show that RSHMMs give a 71.69% ROUGE-L F-measure, a 5.69% absolute increase in lecture speech summarization performance compared to the baseline system without using RSHMM. It equally outperforms the baseline system with additional discourse features, showing that our RSHMM is a more refined improvement on the conventional discourse feature.},

However, these models have their limitations in representing complex, nonlinear relationships between the speech generation inputs and the acoustic features. Inspired by the intrinsically hierarchical process of human speech production and by the successful application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatic speech recognition (ASR), deep learning techniques have also been applied successfully to speech generation, as reported in recent literature. This article systematically reviews these emerging speech generation approaches, with the dual goal of helping readers gain a better understanding of the existing techniques as well as stimulating new work in the burgeoning area of deep learning for parametric speech generation.},

  Abstract                 = {The predominant methodology in training
deep learning advocates the use of stochastic
gradient descent methods (SGDs). Despite
its ease of implementation, SGDs are diffi-
cult to tune and parallelize. These problems
make it challenging to develop, debug and
scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs.
In this paper, we show that more sophisti-
cated off-the-shelf optimization methods such
as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and
Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search
can significantly simplify and speed up the
process of pretraining deep algorithms. In
our experiments, the difference between L-
BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced
if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g.,
sparsity regularization) and hardware ex-
tensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters).
Our experiments with distributed optimiza-
tion support the use of L-BFGS with locally
connected networks and convolutional neural
networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional
network model achieves 0.69% on the stan-
dard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-
art result on MNIST among algorithms that
do not use distortions or pretraining.},

This paper presents a connectionist architecture which automatically develops compact distributed representations for such compositional structures, as well as efficient accessing mechanisms for them. Patterns which stand for the internal nodes of fixed-valence trees are devised through the recursive use of backpropagation on three-layer auto-associative encoder networks. The resulting representations are novel, in that they combine apparently immiscible aspects of features, pointers, and symbol structures. They form a bridge between the data structures necessary for high-level cognitive tasks and the associative, pattern recognition machinery provided by neural networks.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

  Abstract                 = {A finite-horizon discrete H∞ filter design with a linear quadratic (LQ) game approach is presented. The exogenous inputs composed of the “hostile” noise signals and system initial condition are assumed to be finite energy signals with unknown statistics. The design criterion is to minimize the worst possible amplification of the estimation error signals in terms of the exogenous inputs, which is different from the classical minimum variance estimation error criterion for the modified Wiener or Kalman filter design. The approach can show how far the estimation error can be reduced under an existence condition on the solution to a corresponding Riccati equation. A numerical example is given to compare the performance of the H∞ filter with that of the conventional Kalman filter},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new approach based on the H∞
filtering is presented
for speech enhancement. This approach differs from the trad
itional
modified Wiener/Kalman filtering approach in the following two as-
pects: 1) no a priori knowledge of the noise statistics is required;
instead the noise signals are only assumed to have finite energy; 2)
the estimation criterion for the filter design is to minimize the worst
possible amplification of the estimation error signal in terms of the
modeling errors and additive noises. Since most additive noises in
speech are not Gaussian, this approach is highly robust and is more
appropriate in practical speech enhancement. The global signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR), time domain speech representation and listening
evaluations are used to verify the performance of the H∞ filtering
algorithm. Experimented results show that the filtering performance
is better than other speech enhancement approaches in the
literature under similar experimental conditions.},

It is noted that if the left child (for example) is a node made by merging 5 children and the right a node by merging only 2, then it is more important to correctly reconstruct the left child than the right. The weighting function in the RAE in that paper is adjusted as such. 

It can be extended in a similar way to the RvNN by adding additional trained outputs at each node.

It is not purely greedy, on simply training the to minimize the error of the merge at each node. Like the RvNN, it uses BPTS, and attempt to minimize the sum of all errors across the tree.

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the H∞ filtering problem for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems with or without real time-varying parameter uncertainty and unknown initial state. For the case when there is no parametric uncertainty in the system, we are concerned with designing a nonlinear H∞ filter such that the induced l2 norm of the mapping from the noise signal to the estimation error is within a specified bound. It is shown that this problem can be solved via one Riccati equation. We also consider the design of nonlinear filters which guarantee a prescribed H∞ performance in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In this situation, a solution is obtained in terms of two Riccati equations.},

generation based on recurrent neural net-
works which we argue is ideally suited to
capturing poetic content and form. Our
generator

performs content selec-

(“how to say”) by learning representations
of individual characters, and their com-
binations into one or more lines as well
as how these mutually reinforce and con-
strain each other. Poem lines are gener-
ated incrementally by taking into account
the entire history of what has been gen-
erated so far rather than the limited hori-
zon imposed by the previous line or lexical
n
-grams. Experimental results show that
our model outperforms competitive Chi-
nese poetry generation systems using both
automatic and manual evaluation methods.},
