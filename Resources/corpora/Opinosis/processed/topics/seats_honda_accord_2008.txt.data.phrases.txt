front seats are very uncomfortable .
no memory seats , no trip computer , can only display outside *UNKNOWN* with trip *UNKNOWN* .
needs power seats on the passenger side .
i have n't had any back pain from the seats , maybe these people exceed the seat weight limit ?
there is a great deal of road noise in the cabin and the seats are very low quality .
power seats are not fully *UNKNOWN* .
front seats are too narrow and not deep enough .
the seats are extremely uncomfortable .
i previously owned a 98 *UNKNOWN* , and found the seats more comfortable than the *UNKNOWN* .
the seats in the *UNKNOWN* are more firm .
i 'm very sad , i loved my daughter 's civic and the dealer service is fantastic , but even good service ca n't help the uncomfortable seats .
it cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it , but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !
although it is fun to drive and quality seems *UNKNOWN* , the leather seats are very uncomfortable , especially on a long drive .
the seats are decent , the interior design is excellent *UNKNOWN* as well as the exterior design , and thus far it has been extremely reliable .
in fact , i love the car just wish *UNKNOWN* would n't have made such horrible seats .
body was n't used to seats like if you bought a new mattress .
the interior quality is *UNKNOWN* , my 1999 accord *UNKNOWN* had a better comfort level on the seats .
i just purchased an accord sedan with leather seats .
only needs to add drivers seat memory , 2 , tone perforated leather , *UNKNOWN* , rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats , and better tilt .
i can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason i was able to go back the the *UNKNOWN* family .
the seats are very comfortable & supportive .
i test drove an *UNKNOWN* , l and felt the seats were too firm plus , the *UNKNOWN* , l seemed too slow .
this accord has more road noise than i like and the seats tend to be hard , unlike my other accords .
engine performance lacks punch after 60 , head rest are poor design , lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c , radio system is marginal compared to *UNKNOWN* , seats are hard and small for a large person .
the seats are comfortable , and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .
most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle i have ever owned .
only 2 things could make it better memory seats and a *UNKNOWN* shifting transmission .
seats are firm but not uncomfortable , very *UNKNOWN* like .
advise anyone considering the l to drive one for awhile if you can , some can not stand the seats .
the seat cover was coming out in between the seats .
the only for sure complaint i have is the seats seems to hurt my back after i drove for a period of time , this may be because i am use to my *UNKNOWN* truck with leather bucket seats .
do n't rely on your test drive , the seats are very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the *UNKNOWN* mode the vehicle shifts rocks violently forward and when leaving the *UNKNOWN* mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is continuously shaking and rocking .
seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !
it 's a black beauty with *UNKNOWN* leather seats .
