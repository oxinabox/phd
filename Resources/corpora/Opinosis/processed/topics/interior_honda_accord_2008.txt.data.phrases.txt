i love the new body style and the interior is a simple pleasure except for the center dash .
however , there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1 terrible driver seat comfort , kills my back 2 lack luster interior design , my *UNKNOWN* has much better comfort 3 the *UNKNOWN* drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is *UNKNOWN* enough to be an annoyance .
love the interior and the power and speed , but not hard to beat after what i had .
love the interior and exterior look , the *UNKNOWN* is sensational , and getting compliments on the steel metallic color as if it 's a *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* .
the seats are decent , the interior design is excellent *UNKNOWN* as well as the exterior design , and thus far it has been extremely reliable .
the interior quality is *UNKNOWN* , my 1999 accord *UNKNOWN* had a better comfort level on the seats .
the interior design was much nicer .
the interior is nicely equipped and i like the *UNKNOWN* radio but not the monthly fee .
the new *UNKNOWN* is very upscale , and the interior layout is also impressive and *UNKNOWN* inside .
my only reservations are the ivory cloth interior 's durability had to have *UNKNOWN* white !
nice car , add ' l $ $ for premium gas , not as big of interior as accord , dealer that we would utilize for service not clean .
i do n't like the dash radio assembly , but the interior has a luxury look .
only needs to add drivers seat memory , 2 , tone perforated leather , *UNKNOWN* , rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats , and better tilt .
biggest plus i think is the *UNKNOWN* of the interior and the trunk .
the ride is very good the interior is awesome .
my car is *UNKNOWN* white and i wish there was another interior color option other than ivory !
however after checking out the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , i was disappointed with the quality of the interior and outdated dash .

the interior is huge and the exterior is super sleek .
the interior has loud *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* coming from the glove box .

the interior is really noisy unless the road surface is smooth .
