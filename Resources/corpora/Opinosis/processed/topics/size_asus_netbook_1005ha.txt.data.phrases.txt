a few other things i 'd like to point out is that you must push the *UNKNOWN* , sized right angle end of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .
the full size right shift key was enough for me to drop my *UNKNOWN* .
you should understand that this is not a full featured laptop squeezed into a smaller and manageable size .

the performance is great for it 's size , remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .
i must remind buyer 's these are not meant to be a replacement for a full size *UNKNOWN* , they do n't have *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* drives in them although you can get an external , which i have .
the keyboard is n't quite full sized of course , but very easy to get used to .
i had some real problems trying to use my *UNKNOWN* satellite when flying for the past few years , and the distance between the top of the display and the edge of the *UNKNOWN* when open is a practical size to get my work done on a flight .

great battery life , decent sized screen , and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
i originally bought the *UNKNOWN* to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere , but have started exclusively using the *UNKNOWN* in place of my laptop because of its *UNKNOWN* and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .
light weight and small size , this was highly important during my travels .
the *UNKNOWN* is comfortable , the keyboard is normal sized , so i do n't make any adjustment when typing .
i needed this for a business trip because my full size laptop needs service .
this *UNKNOWN* is great and i love its small compact size and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
my advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .
although the screen is relatively small to my eyes it was n't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright , no *UNKNOWN* reading articles and writing *UNKNOWN* .
one of the things that i found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .
also tried a full size *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and a little wired *UNKNOWN* notebook mouse *UNKNOWN* like all mice but *UNKNOWN* if a mouse is your idea of a good time .
i 'm using it with a *UNKNOWN* 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed *UNKNOWN* and runs off a *UNKNOWN* port .
the screen is very sharp and *UNKNOWN* even with the tiny text at this size .
and you ca n't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .
the small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop , the long battery life is really great , and the speed and performance using various *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* connections was better than i expected it to be .
the keyboard is excellent and even though only 92 % the size of a full size keyboard , feels like the big one .
the overall size is just perfect for what i wanted .
the keyboard is just the right size .
the battery life is to die for , my full size laptop doesnt have 10
due to the size of *UNKNOWN* and a wide screen format , the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to *UNKNOWN* with the keyboard .
i love the lightweight , small size of this product .
the power *UNKNOWN* is a nice small size
it seems as though this is due to the small size of the unit , it does n't have enough room to dissipate the heat .
just right for the size of my hands .
because of its size and ease of travel , pretty soon this became an important part of my wife 's professional life and she was using it for work , business discussions , document development *UNKNOWN* .
i was never a fan of really large laptops or even standard sized ones as i like to stick to the definition of portable , so this fit 's the bill .
like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike *UNKNOWN* 17 which is almost same size .
instead i convert *UNKNOWN* to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* files using fair use wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great , *UNKNOWN* files look fine on this size of screen .
it 's 90 % size keyboard does n't take too long to get used to .
i was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read , but it has been great for everything i run :
i love the feel of typing on it , and have not had any issues transferring from a regular , sized keyboard to a smaller one .
i was also worried that it 's small size would equate to something delicate , but i am rough on my electronics , and the *UNKNOWN* has handled a few rough *UNKNOWN* with textbooks in a bag *UNKNOWN* into my car seat without any problems .
years old , so the screen size was also a concern , but it is adequate for the type of things i use it for .
as soon as you connect the *UNKNOWN* cable to an unknown *UNKNOWN* and press the function key for projection , it automatically *UNKNOWN* the size and resolution to fit the *UNKNOWN* even if it can not display properly on its own screen .
but the projection was always perfect in full size and proper aspect ratio .
i have more productivity flow on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
if i were looking to get work done quickly , i would pay the extra money to go full , sized , even if it 's slower .
the big one for me is its small size meaning that i can put it in the smaller pocket of the backpack and nobody would know that there was a laptop in there .
