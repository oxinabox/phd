3 *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* display was a bonus .
this made for *UNKNOWN* graphics on the *UNKNOWN* of the vehicle moving along displayed roads , where the 750 's display was more of a jerky movement .
i also found that the display on the *UNKNOWN* was a bit brighter , clearer , and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night .
the 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the *UNKNOWN* .
the 255 also automatically *UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .
another feature on the *UNKNOWN* is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .
the *UNKNOWN* has a really clear display that 's easy to see in any light .
the new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen , which is a new feature that is also really helpful , if you 're driving in an unfamiliar area .
the *UNKNOWN* display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen , , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right that are only one house apart .
the bad , my unit only displays elevation *UNKNOWN* at *UNKNOWN* levels of 20 miles or higher .
update on this , it finally turned out that to see the elevation *UNKNOWN* at lower *UNKNOWN* levels you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .
i also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .
my old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of *UNKNOWN* on the map display .
i have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when , for example , i am entering *UNKNOWN* .
display is excellent , the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top , your speed , the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
in the map view , if you touch the display button to the left of the menu button , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a *UNKNOWN* of sorts .
the navigation display shows more information , such as next turn street and speed limit , and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as i have seen in other models .
for me , the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .
so i finally got the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* after months of *UNKNOWN* and comparing wit other brands , adding 3 days of looking *UNKNOWN* in circuit city and best buy stores displays .
it also can display and speak many languages .
i am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* speaks and display it !
the display is great , and is very clear .
the instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand , but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .
the way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
through this option you can find sub , options which will allow you to change the language , set display , navigation , time , map , and security preferences .
the extra features of the *UNKNOWN* over lesser models that i find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
since the directions are also displayed on the screen , i find the occasional *UNKNOWN* entertaining and not an issue .
i have checked the display in three areas i am familiar with :
but is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .
i have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much , but there is an adjustment for it .
the display is extremely *UNKNOWN* both in bright sunlight and at night .
, the speed limit sign on the display is *UNKNOWN* but in the first week of using the *UNKNOWN* i found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .
the unit speaks street names , has a beautiful display and a very *UNKNOWN* interface .
also , if you 're searching for a business , it displays the phone number .
i also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .
well when i saw that the *UNKNOWN* had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner i jumped at it .
the *UNKNOWN* has a nice *UNKNOWN* display .
one unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
i like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .
i really like the *UNKNOWN* of picking destination points either by *UNKNOWN* an explicit address , *UNKNOWN* from *UNKNOWN* maps , or just touching a point on the display .
the display is bright & clear in the car .
the display is laid out better than the 660 .
it is very easy to use , and when driving in the us , it displays the speed limit and your speed , which is helpful when converting from kms to miles .
it should have the names of streets written down on the display roads as you pass them .
the display is very easy to read , and the directions were very good .
the new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .
the sound went out on it and only the display worked .
