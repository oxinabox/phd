i bought the 8 , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* that has the built , in video camera .
*UNKNOWN* has an on , line store , where you may purchase and download music and videos which will install onto the *UNKNOWN* .
i have lots of music *UNKNOWN* 's and *UNKNOWN* 's , so currently i 'm just interested in storing some of my music and videos on the *UNKNOWN* so i can enjoy them on my vacation , and while at work .
there 's a right way and wrong way to store music and videos onto the *UNKNOWN* .
audio and video recording are a step above the competition .
as always , the video screen is sharp and bright .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* even better with video camera !
this time around , apple is *UNKNOWN* out of its *UNKNOWN* formula in a small , but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the *UNKNOWN* with its own video camera .
still , video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen , such as the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* touch .
the user interface of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* remains almost entirely unchanged with the exception of a few new menu items for the video camera , *UNKNOWN* radio , and fitness features .
i can listen to it without headphones , i can record video .
it looks nicer than my other one , love the video and everything else this one can do
wish *UNKNOWN* could *UNKNOWN* them too announcer for songs is kind of annoying have n't yet tried the video , but very pleased with the size and quality of my music on this *UNKNOWN* .
hard to delete videos from the *UNKNOWN* device .
the video design allow you to take different types of *UNKNOWN* like x , ray , monochrome , and twist making it enjoyable to play .
the video quality is actually fairly good , my friend *UNKNOWN* a video with it and she *UNKNOWN* it to *UNKNOWN* and it came out great !
it eve *UNKNOWN* out better than a video she took with an actual camera camera !
the video quality is perfect .
great for music , just *UNKNOWN* for video
video recorder only , can not take just photos .
the video , voice and *UNKNOWN* recorder is one great addition to it .
as for the video camera it 's a nice addition considering it 's an *UNKNOWN* player first and foremost , i think people are going to go into this and think maybe i can replace my old video , no .
it just a solid low quality video camera some of the lighting or your fingers may get in the way of the actual recording but once you get use to it , it can become fun .
i find it weird that it will take video but not still *UNKNOWN* .
it looks just like the 4th generation , except on the back , there 's a camera to take video clips or whatever it is you want to .
i hate *UNKNOWN* , but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie , so though i originally started with 3rd party *UNKNOWN* for *UNKNOWN* i have since switched to *UNKNOWN* .
this time around , apple is *UNKNOWN* out of its *UNKNOWN* formula in a small , but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the *UNKNOWN* with its own video camera .
the video works very well for such a small sensor and it is so easy and convenient to use .
we have had portable video players for our children as our cars are not equipped with these devices .
video camera quality and sound are also surprising for such a small unit .
not a tremendous surprise here , as we believed the sixth , generation true video *UNKNOWN* would not be announced until later in the year or even early in 2007 .
the *UNKNOWN* is *UNKNOWN* for video addicts both for the capacity *UNKNOWN* movies are about 1 .
the video camera is nice , just wish it could take *UNKNOWN* .
the one problem with the video camera is it is not the easiest thing to use .
i also like that videos can be watched on it as well as listening to it without the ear phones that is a really great feature .
the only odd thing is that is has a video camera but does n't have a single shot camera .
easy to use , video camera , radio , size , sound quality .
the battery does n't last a long time especially when you 're recording or watching a video but i just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .
the video quality is great and has different settings .
definitely easier to use than the *UNKNOWN* touch , and the video camera feature is awesome .
that way you will have enough storage to add music , video and pictures !
i have n't found anything that is not so great this is a *UNKNOWN* use *UNKNOWN* player with the ability to make videos , music and videos .
great new features in this *UNKNOWN* generation include voice recording , listening to radio , and even filming video .
has video camera and voice memo .
the video looks great and it 's easy to use .
no off switch compared to *UNKNOWN* 4 the ability to listen without speakers and the video camera is great .
as easy to use as any other *UNKNOWN* , and the video is good .
she loves to make her own videos and play them back .
the videos are so clear i just love it .
however , the way it is designed , it is clumsy to hold while recording a video .
camera does only video , not pictures way better than 2nd *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
love the camera , but wish it had photo capabilities , rather than just video .
it 's got radio , video , camera , video camera , small .
love the *UNKNOWN* feature on the *UNKNOWN* and the video *UNKNOWN* .
the color , the video , overall the item is great .
the size is very nice and compact and the videos are beautiful !
it would be nice to delete songs when they get old the video camera is the best , i use it all the time .
it was fine quality sounds for roof , raising music and also insane levels of *UNKNOWN* for music videos or movies on the go !
the video camera feature is awesome enough , but all of the special effects are incredible .
he loves shooting video and then viewing it in *UNKNOWN* mode or in *UNKNOWN* tones .
our 12 year old loves the *UNKNOWN* , especially the video camera feature .
lots of features i got this for my son because he wanted an *UNKNOWN* player and a video camera for *UNKNOWN* .
like the extra features , *UNKNOWN* , video camera , radio , speakers .

plenty of memory to add all your *UNKNOWN* music and videos .
the *UNKNOWN* holds a lot of music and video .
video , motion sensing , screen size and *UNKNOWN* look i recently upgraded from the 2nd generation *UNKNOWN* and love the new features of the newest model .
ca n't believe the picture quality and ease of video use !
it will take video , but not pictures ?
secondly , the thing has the capability to record video , but wo n't take pictures .
yeah , that 's typed correctly , video , but not pictures .
seems *UNKNOWN* silly that they would go right to video and completely neglect photography .
my daughter loves taking video , as well as the music & *UNKNOWN* !
she takes videos and *UNKNOWN* with it all the time .
i decided to get this *UNKNOWN* cause of the memory and the video cam in the back .
the video camera and the graphics is so cool !
easy to use and cool video camera !
comes in different colors , make videos , and holds *UNKNOWN* of music .
small , holds lots of songs , video , easy to use .
ca n't figure out how to review the video clips i record .
this is an easy to use item , but is slightly confusing to use when trying to review video clips .
it takes video and has a really cool radio feature on it , according to the kids .
easy to use , cool helpful features , video camera , voice over .
the video camera is great and the different effects are fun to mess around with .
it would be nice if the video camera zoomed in a little and if there was a regular camera as well , but those are pretty minor complaints .
my daughter thinks that the video clarity is amazing and finds the built in speakers awesome .
the camera and video feature are wonderful .
holds tons of music , video , *UNKNOWN* .
i wish the video camera had a pause on it , but you ca n't pause .
it can hold tons of music , video , *UNKNOWN* and watching movies on the plane is nice .
i also wish the video camera had a pause on it , but it does n't pause and starts with a new video *UNKNOWN* you stop it .
she did n't want the touch , she wanted the *UNKNOWN* because you can video , it has the radio that she can play back the songs and she likes the size .
the video camera is great and the screen size is a nice size
we have n't tried the video yet , so i ca n't comment on that .
great video quality , no ear *UNKNOWN* required internal sound system sounds great .
still to new to we 'll see great product , video feature is awesome and i love how there is now internal sound and you do n't have to use ear *UNKNOWN* with it .
do n't really need video camera *UNKNOWN* we do n't use the video that much the rest of the features are great .
it does so many things , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , video , *UNKNOWN* , and more !
i love how easy it is to download from *UNKNOWN* and the fact i can also do video .

glad you listen to the radio , play games and take video .
none of my old *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* work with this one fun new *UNKNOWN* , the video feature is fun but difficult to learn how to use .
i 've downloaded a lot of *UNKNOWN* and music from *UNKNOWN* , also a few music videos , which are great fun to watch and hear .
great for spot video if you do not have a camera *UNKNOWN* on hand .
some changes such as video camera and bigger *UNKNOWN* , but it was just *UNKNOWN* .

video , even in low light , is impressive .
even the built , in video camera is very good .
i 'm really disappointed that apple is so proprietary that you ca n't use anything but *UNKNOWN* to add music and videos to an *UNKNOWN* .
it has a built in video camera , and it shoots in high quality , which i was surprised at .
n you can put music videos pictures .
the video camera is cool , but i do n't know that i would use it much .
this can record videos and it is also very very light weight !

*UNKNOWN* radio lots of storage for music , videos and pictures alarm clock to your tunes blue color lock button so you do n't accidentally turn it off on ease of use cons :
hard to get videos onto computer this was a purchase i made after i returned my *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
a must , buy for everybody who loves music and video .
video camera built in and music plays without head phones .
need a video program on your computer to obtain video great product for the price .
i had the *UNKNOWN* video but it did not work with my new *UNKNOWN*
chip so i bought the newest *UNKNOWN* video the day it came out .
i can not figure out how to get the video i record off of the *UNKNOWN* .
, i can not figure out how to get the video i recorded on my *UNKNOWN* off to upload it to *UNKNOWN* or you tube .
shoes if using *UNKNOWN* cam for long time , it kills battery standard *UNKNOWN* video recording , but still sharp !
only things i wish they added is measuring distance *UNKNOWN* not just steps *UNKNOWN* on the *UNKNOWN* , better sound on the speaker , and a capturing still images with the video recording feature .
the video recording feature is the best part .
7 out of 10 have not used video yet but the pixels would be just the same .
the product is very useful if you want to go out for a jog and listen to your music or watch some videos if you stuck on a bus or subway .
video camera , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , speaker , *UNKNOWN* .
location of the video camera , and the gap between the click wheel and *UNKNOWN* the best *UNKNOWN* ever and has the best features ever .

the video camera is a great feature to have , however its not that high of a quality when you transfer it onto your computer .
camera has great video effects .
the videos you record do not show up on *UNKNOWN* though , you have to go to my computer and find the *UNKNOWN* drive , then open the *UNKNOWN* named *UNKNOWN* , and the video files are in .
when you 're not in a game or watching a video , if you turn it on the side , *UNKNOWN* displays , however you can turn this feature off .

video camera with fun special effects , *UNKNOWN* radio .
the glossy fingerprint attracting finish compared to last year 's beautiful *UNKNOWN* finish great improvements with the video camera , really fun special effects , easy to use , also great *UNKNOWN* radio with pause feature .
then it would be perfect oh and make a 32 or *UNKNOWN* version so i can fit all my music and have lots of room for video , thanks !
but overall i love it , between the radio , speaker , microphone , video camera , effects , there are enough new features to justify buying a new *UNKNOWN* .
it 's great to have a decent video camera with you at all times if you do n't have an *UNKNOWN* .

video option is easy to use .
i have the 5th *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* video , and this thing blows it away !

amazing amount of music photos videos can be stored .
video taking feature is interesting .
