the *UNKNOWN* is one of our favorite hotels in *UNKNOWN* and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .
the rooms look like they were just *UNKNOWN* and upgraded , there was an *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and a nice *UNKNOWN* docking station to put my *UNKNOWN* so i could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio .
great rooms staff and location but extras *UNKNOWN* .
hotel was very clean and the rooms were *UNKNOWN* .
the standard rooms are small , the lobby bar is very small .
my son loved the *UNKNOWN* river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .
the rooms were small and much more expensive .
i 've *UNKNOWN* ever stayed in the *UNKNOWN* standard ' rooms in this property , all of which are *UNKNOWN* and airy , and function well for both business or leisure travellers .
rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of *UNKNOWN* or , on the other side , will face navy pier , .
but we really did spend very little time in our rooms .
the rooms were cleaned *UNKNOWN* and span every day .
but i guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .
we were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly .
building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor , so very quiet and no hall noise .
the hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky , and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .
the view from the rooms is of the river and city , lake *UNKNOWN* or of millennium park .
the rooms were great , the staff was excellent .
the location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile , and views from most rooms very good .
very impressed with rooms and view !
they have just recently upgraded the hotel rooms and they are wonderful .
the rooms are bright and airy with wonderful beds and bedding .
the ideal location coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .
very pretty rooms with an *UNKNOWN* flair .
locker rooms were clean and had a *UNKNOWN* .
rooms are good quality and clean , what you would expect from a four star business hotel .
the rooms are large , the view was wonderful overlooking navy pier .
the rooms are very nice , the location is excellent , but the service is terrible !
the rooms are *UNKNOWN* and pristine with pillow , top beds that made it almost impossible to get up in the morning because it was so comfortable .
we stayed in two rooms on the 22 floor in *UNKNOWN* with our two teenage daughters .
the view from the rooms was fantastic , my daughters are allergic to feathers and all trace of them were removed from the room as soon as we advised *UNKNOWN* .
the rooms were *UNKNOWN* clean and *UNKNOWN* each day .
we and , unfortunately , got to stay in three different rooms .
the rooms are very nice , well , appointed , with comfortable beds .
the recent renovation is great , , the guest rooms are really nice .
the rooms were large and clean .
the rooms are very clean , comfortable and *UNKNOWN* and up , to , date .
rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $ 250 , 300 .
it does suffer , however , from a trend that i have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded , particularly with a patch panel for the big *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , drawer space becomes less and less .
why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?
the rooms were nice , clean and updated .
had to move rooms and floors .
our rooms were still not ready by *UNKNOWN* .
the other two rooms were not clean .
they did n't charge us for the room , , , , but , also did not offer any type of compensation to the woman who arranged these rooms in *UNKNOWN* .
i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the rooms .
the room was two rooms from the elevators and i could still hear them but it was n't too bad .
the hotel and rooms were very clean .
great location nice rooms loved the *UNKNOWN* !
the rooms were very clean , the service was polite and helpful , and it 's near the heart of *UNKNOWN* !
thanks to *UNKNOWN* i was able to find an amazing deal , lakeside rooms for $ 129 night as part of a spring promotion .
the hotel looks like an office tower , the rooms look like converted *UNKNOWN* and the place has all of the charm of a fortune 500 executive suite .
the rooms were clean and modern .
i ended up with a double on the 7th floor , i would 've preferred a king since i was alone , but it was one of the renovated rooms so i decided to keep it .
the rooms are large and well , appointed , the staff was very professional and friendly , and the view was striking !
great location but rooms need some work .
all on the way from *UNKNOWN* i was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .
he then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .
i called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
when i got to the room , i thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them , but i guess those come later .
i did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $ 6 which i think is *UNKNOWN* .
there were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation *UNKNOWN* the king bed request on it .
very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor , rooms and lobby were clean , easy walk to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* through via the lower level walkway to the *UNKNOWN* state center , beds were comfortable .
the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views , the staff was extremely rude .
the rooms are *UNKNOWN* and have nice views , i was not impressed with the mattress and every , little , tiny thing costs money .
very well *UNKNOWN* , the rooms are *UNKNOWN* and very comfortable with every thing you need .
from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .
we even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms which also looked west toward *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and the *UNKNOWN* building .
as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .
i *UNKNOWN* stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but *UNKNOWN* .
this time , no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one , bedroom , 1 .
in our case , it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience .
rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .
rooms in this hotel are noisy though .
i called in a few hours before check in time to see if any rooms were available for check , in , the operator connected me to the reservations desk .
got to hotel , rooms were n't ready yet .
the rooms were sleek and cool , great views .
i recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .
it was a good hotel , the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .
our rooms were nice and did n't look worn or old .
the rooms were comparable but i have to admit i loved the *UNKNOWN* service , especially the *UNKNOWN* and front desk .
the rooms are in pretty shabby condition , but they are clean .
while the rooms are a bit dated , the location is great .
the bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades , but for $ 109 a night through *UNKNOWN* it was great .
since we were staying during busy memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .
our family of 4 *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* the comfort of a more *UNKNOWN* suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and navy pier that *UNKNOWN* 's *UNKNOWN* rooms provide .
you can see downtown and or the navy pier from most of the rooms .
great location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .
there is simply no better way to experience the 4th of *UNKNOWN* in *UNKNOWN* , than in one of the corner rooms with a view of navy pier .
rooms very *UNKNOWN* and clean .
large rooms and excellent service .
the interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic , lacking the style of some of *UNKNOWN* 's newer hotels .
but the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .
it seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .
it could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses , televisions and desks .
the *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .
suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies , i immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .
these rooms are right next to the elevators .
contemporary in its *UNKNOWN* , the rooms are *UNKNOWN* and the bathrooms are very nice .
for 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2 , so i was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .
i originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1 , 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .
the service staff always left our rooms clean , and even arranged my *UNKNOWN* jewelry for her , *UNKNOWN* her necklaces and earrings from each other , and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !
the rooms were clean , and upscale for the low price we paid .
great hotel with great rooms .
the rooms were very *UNKNOWN* and clean , especially for downtown *UNKNOWN* standards .
most importantly , the rooms were quiet .
the rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .
the hotel is really pretty , but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .
i would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .
the *UNKNOWN* of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated , looks like it has n't been touched for years .
the *UNKNOWN* was a great place to stay , rooms were very clean , and quiet at night for a great nights rest , with extremely comfortable beds , and high quality bedding .
we had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced lake *UNKNOWN* there 's some construction right now *UNKNOWN* and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .
so , in all , i would definitely stay *UNKNOWN* , even though the service *UNKNOWN* , the *UNKNOWN* for rich patrons with money to blow and the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , the rooms make up for it .
some of the other hotels in the same class in *UNKNOWN* might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don t seem to have the same *UNKNOWN* amenities that the *UNKNOWN* has .
rooms were good , nothing spectacular about them except the views .
the beds were extremely comfortable , rooms were extremely *UNKNOWN* and the bathrooms were as well .
we did n't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a & *UNKNOWN* normal & *UNKNOWN* room and loved it , and said it was one of the *UNKNOWN* and most importantly cleanest they 'd been in lately .
from talking to other guests , i concluded that rooms ending with numbers *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !
one thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $ 10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .
i pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .
honestly , i would rate the service and location a three , the rooms a four , and the view a five !
then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non , smoking .
the hotel was very nice , rooms were big , the pool hot tub area was very nice , and the location was great and easy to get to .
it is true that the rooms have a little *UNKNOWN* wear ' , but not to the point of being a problem .
rooms are dated , our corner room 's bathroom was shabby .
word to the wise , , avoid the rooms ending with 11 .
rooms were clean , good sized and great views of navy pier .
the rooms were very clean and *UNKNOWN* .
while the rooms are quite nice , i was dismayed by the *UNKNOWN* service i received at the *UNKNOWN* in *UNKNOWN* .
so , while the rooms are very nice , i will never stay at a *UNKNOWN* again , in any city .
then again , the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it .
the room was huge as hotel rooms go .
rooms are lovely as well , with handsome fixtures and furniture , a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed .
rooms were very comfortable and *UNKNOWN* with nice furniture , *UNKNOWN* bed , luxurious bathroom , great *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
there 's also an indoor pool , large *UNKNOWN* room , and *UNKNOWN* men 's and women 's locker rooms on the top floor with floor , to , ceiling windows all around you .
the rooms are not all that big .
in fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks !
the rooms are *UNKNOWN* and i 've never had any problems with noise , they are much quieter than other hotels i 've been at .
i called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms .
at this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and i would be stranded in *UNKNOWN* with no available rooms at a reputable hotel .
the views were amazing , the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever i had a question .
the views are fabulous , the rooms clean and roomy .
large clean rooms and comfortable bed .
these rooms are very *UNKNOWN* and the beds are very comfortable .
the rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .
exceptional rooms and service !
hotel 's architecture is nice , location near all point of *UNKNOWN* and rooms are large , clean , quiet .
we showed them our *UNKNOWN* by , request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a *UNKNOWN* upgrade to a *UNKNOWN* level room , not both rooms but one room .
strange , we thought , since we had booked *UNKNOWN* level rooms .
the rooms with the navy pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level , currents , was an excellent dining experience .
*UNKNOWN* of the common areas that i enjoyed so much have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms .
the rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible .
expensive parking but great rooms .
rooms were nicely furnished .
pool is nice with whirlpool and *UNKNOWN* in the locker rooms .
the rooms are business , oriented , so they are not as hip or stylish as , say , the *UNKNOWN* place or the *UNKNOWN* .
