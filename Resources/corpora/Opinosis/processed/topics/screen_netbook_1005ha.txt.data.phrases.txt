keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying .
i 've used mine outside on a sunny day , and the screen is still very much *UNKNOWN* .
in fact it was much more detailed than the *UNKNOWN* screen on my *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
some *UNKNOWN* may prefer a higher resolution screen but i do n't think it 's required .
i delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries , faulty *UNKNOWN* and blue screen crashes .
1 inch screens , windows *UNKNOWN* operating systems , a plethora of *UNKNOWN* ports , a card reader , *UNKNOWN* and most have a few color choices .
1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several *UNKNOWN* have been turned on .
some of the *UNKNOWN* special on screen controls , update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying *UNKNOWN* stuff .
two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life , and the led *UNKNOWN* for the screen .
the ways the screen opens enables a smaller *UNKNOWN* when the case is closed , although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .
surfing the net is a breeze , but i did have one blue screen of death when dealing with one demanding internet site .
the light weight , the battery life , the keyboard , the non , *UNKNOWN* removable battery , the bright screen , the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .
i recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom , other wise you find the screen suddenly *UNKNOWN* when you did not want it to do so .
*UNKNOWN* in or *UNKNOWN* out of a screen , but on occasion it will *UNKNOWN* when you do n't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb , *UNKNOWN* .
the occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away *UNKNOWN* attributes it to an errant driver , but i have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .
the screen is not as bright as my *UNKNOWN* .
there are 2 *UNKNOWN* updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .
this makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .
also if you install *UNKNOWN* web browser and push the *UNKNOWN* key the browser becomes full screen , helpful on a small screen .
i got used to the glossy screens a while ago this one is remarkably bright and vivid .
now i keep getting the blue screen serious errors .
wrote it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times .
sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no *UNKNOWN* reason .
i began by considering *UNKNOWN* with screens smaller than the now , standard 10 .
if money is your leading consideration , then one of these may be for you , but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen , better battery life , bigger drive , more *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
but with screen *UNKNOWN* cranked up , *UNKNOWN* & *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* in constant use , some video *UNKNOWN* , and internet radio running , i 'm getting a good 8
with *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* off & the screen dimmed , i do n't think i 'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .
the keyboard is not quite perfect , the screen does n't tilt back as far as i 'd like , slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the *UNKNOWN* .
has an 11 screen with the same or better battery life , .
it 's small with a very clear screen .
i 've had the *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* for a week now , on and running applications continuously , without a single crash , blue screen , or *UNKNOWN* .
the *UNKNOWN* feels great , the boot up was fast , keyboard feels comfortable , and the screen is good .
my only complaint with it is that the screen does n't go back far enough .
the *UNKNOWN* works well , the screen glossy , *UNKNOWN* really does n't bother me , and it 's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .
on full screen display is smooth and no issues .
some *UNKNOWN* content is a little *UNKNOWN* if it is *UNKNOWN* display , but not full screen for some reason , but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .
and with a two , fingered gesture on the *UNKNOWN* , you can enlarge or shrink the screen .
on a full charge , with wireless on , screen *UNKNOWN* on medium , i get a reported 8 .
5 hours with no wireless , and screen *UNKNOWN* on minimum .
5 pass , screen is bright and large enough .
once i *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* to always run full screen mode , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .
all features worked *UNKNOWN* for me so far especially appreciate the *UNKNOWN* lock button as well as the screen off function key .
heavy *UNKNOWN* weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards with the screen pushed back all the way
the screen is stunning , and if you 've got a bright light shining down on it , you 've got a choice :
you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare , or move the lamp .
i 'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare , than deal with a *UNKNOWN* screen 24 7 .
one of the other complaints i 'd come across is how for some , the screen does n't tilt back far enough .
yeah , you 'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .
and i could have gotten a *UNKNOWN* screen , but neither of those features impressed me .
except for difficulties seeing the entire new *UNKNOWN* times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen , the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* my needs and seems about as fast as my 5 , year , old *UNKNOWN* laptop .
i was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen *UNKNOWN* , although it normally recovered from that .
also considered lower , end 14 , 15 screens for use of the *UNKNOWN* .
i like the *UNKNOWN* screen fine .
the screen is too small for any meaningful work , but the *UNKNOWN* do work .
again , the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .
like others have said , it is definitely a fingerprint magnet , and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .
i received my *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* yesterday installed the two *UNKNOWN* ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .
the screen is small , only *UNKNOWN* x 600 .
i can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .
i can tell the *UNKNOWN* is on , but all i get is a black screen .
i do n't even see the *UNKNOWN* screen on startup .
the screen is sharp and bright .
the screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .
with the view *UNKNOWN* , the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .
the fashionable *UNKNOWN* of both body and screen *UNKNOWN* fingerprints and *UNKNOWN* rapidly .
the shiny screen is reflective , which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .
i keep the screen *UNKNOWN* set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* on .
i do n't know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen *UNKNOWN* goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .
it is a fingerprint magnet , and because of the glossy screen , its very reflective of light .
, do n't know why they use the screen size most do , *UNKNOWN* x 600 seems cramped
takes sometime to get use to the small screen .
yeah , the new led screen technology is that good .
the screen resolution is n't the highest you can get but i found that the higher resolution *UNKNOWN* usually had older *UNKNOWN* for some reason .
i 'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .
i usually run *UNKNOWN* in full screen mode with a 95 % *UNKNOWN* setting and a *UNKNOWN* resolution .
surprisingly *UNKNOWN* screen for the size .
4 do not get wax on your screen .
hit *UNKNOWN* and you have full screen browsing , just move the *UNKNOWN* to the top of the screen for the controls .
the screen really is too small , *UNKNOWN* is barely *UNKNOWN* .
with the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .
screen *UNKNOWN* is very satisfactory .
*UNKNOWN* docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all *UNKNOWN* software .
the screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions .
my other *UNKNOWN* laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside .
long battery life , sharp looking machine , fingerprint magnet , glossy screen *UNKNOWN* glare , ease of use and *UNKNOWN* .
the most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .
the cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92 % keyboard which is plenty comfortable .
the battery life is excellent , with normal usage i can get about 7 hours easily , more if i turn off *UNKNOWN* and turn down the screen *UNKNOWN* .
screen is nice , and adequately sized , , use *UNKNOWN* browsing .
i also needed web connectivity for research , a screen with a low *UNKNOWN* factor and a keyboard that was n't too cramped .
the screen size works just fine for me .
having the *UNKNOWN* feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature , but i have to admit having never needing to use it .
and it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally *UNKNOWN* up in , with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .
, i 'm still getting used to the small screen .
tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing
i 'll see the first black screen , it appears to be starting , and then stays with either a gray or black screen .
3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and i have to re , start to get it to work .
1 keyboard still floats *UNKNOWN* screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .
great battery life , decent sized screen , and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
very nice , in fact , though i strongly dislike glossy screens , no matter , i knew it would have one when i ordered it .
the battery life has been very good , especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and *UNKNOWN* , and turning down the screen *UNKNOWN* .
9 screens , but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .
the screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably .
0 out of 5 stars bad *UNKNOWN* screen , *UNKNOWN* 7 , *UNKNOWN*
i fired it up and out of the box it has a *UNKNOWN* red line on the *UNKNOWN* screen .
just a big dark , screen *UNKNOWN* .
the *UNKNOWN* is light and sturdy , and it the screen looks great .
only 10 , inch screen , small keyboard and no *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
my advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .
decent speed processor , nice screen quality , great *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , and very long battery life .
pretty decent screen quality .
although the screen is relatively small to my eyes it was n't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright , no *UNKNOWN* reading articles and writing *UNKNOWN* .
one of the things that i found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .
10 can be enough for some , but it was *UNKNOWN* small for me , so the thing i did was try to *UNKNOWN* out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .
when using internet explorer or *UNKNOWN* , press *UNKNOWN* and the screen will enlarge , giving you some additional freedom and space .
glossy screens are the *UNKNOWN* invention of this millenium .
seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .
as new *UNKNOWN* come out , look for the ones with *UNKNOWN* screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .
the screen is very sharp and *UNKNOWN* even with the tiny text at this size .
with *UNKNOWN* of ram , it really is n't too bad to try to run *UNKNOWN* or something either , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .
the battery life is unbelievable , even while using *UNKNOWN* to transfer files , watching movies and surfing the internet with screen *UNKNOWN* all the way up .
factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen *UNKNOWN* set to 50 % but can easily be adjusted to the necessary *UNKNOWN* illumination you may need .
the *UNKNOWN* screen can be set , if you wish , so that it is a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* to a larger *UNKNOWN* desktop , *UNKNOWN* by moving the mouse to the screen edge .
this is useful if you have an application that demands a *UNKNOWN* screen .
screen appearance is enhanced by *UNKNOWN* software , and i do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .
the 10 inch screen started getting to me on the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
i love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .
the mouse pad is very sensitive so i sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if i accidentally touch something .
the screen is comfortable and *UNKNOWN* bright for *UNKNOWN* use .
the screen is crisp and clear , and the unit runs great .
the greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .
yes , screen is small , video card is weak , and keyboard is cramped , but this is the case for other *UNKNOWN* at this price point .
i have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what *UNKNOWN* seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running *UNKNOWN* and other applications with around half screen *UNKNOWN* .
streaming videos from *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* look incredible on this 10 inch screen .
the only minor issue that i have with *UNKNOWN* is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .
the screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the *UNKNOWN* on desktop .
due to the size of *UNKNOWN* and a wide screen format , the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to *UNKNOWN* with the keyboard .
the screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of *UNKNOWN* .
the 10 , inch screen is bright and has good color , and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .
performance is good , screen very good , wireless very good , numerous *UNKNOWN* ports , and keyboard layout is excellent .
it boots up quickly , especially after getting rid of the extra *UNKNOWN* software that auto , boots at startup , its battery life is phenomenal , the screen is clear and easy to read , the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
but even with that , and the glossy screen , fingerprint magnet , limited screen tilt , *UNKNOWN* speakers , and intermittent odd glitches , i still think it 's a great value and would buy it again today if i were on the market for a *UNKNOWN* .
now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well .
blue screen crashed several times .
hard to see full web pages on small screen , resolution inadequate .
instead i convert *UNKNOWN* to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* files using fair use wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great , *UNKNOWN* files look fine on this size of screen .
the screen resolution can be a little small at times , but that is a sacrifice i was willing to make .
yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen , the key board actually works better than my laptop though .
i was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read , but it has been great for everything i run :
most of my professors teach from power points , and it makes my life so much simpler having the *UNKNOWN* on my screen that i can *UNKNOWN* while listening to the lecture .
i have not accidentally knocked it over , but i think it could easily be done the screen is glossy .
purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of windows and the larger screen .
years old , so the screen size was also a concern , but it is adequate for the type of things i use it for .
as soon as you connect the *UNKNOWN* cable to an unknown *UNKNOWN* and press the function key for projection , it automatically *UNKNOWN* the size and resolution to fit the *UNKNOWN* even if it can not display properly on its own screen .
the keyboard is great and the screen looks good .
it 's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .
i personally have n't had a problem with the screen , but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .
for this extra amount , i was looking for the larger screen , the longer battery life and the keyboard *UNKNOWN* .
i have more productivity flow on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .
the small screen is probably the biggest *UNKNOWN* .
could be better and do n't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen it *UNKNOWN* it to make more visible .
browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with *UNKNOWN* .
that extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .
in full screen browsing it is so much better that i would never go back .
because the screen is so small in order to get the standard *UNKNOWN* 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be smashed so the display is slightly altered .
one hint , there 's a setting that lets you *UNKNOWN* the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .
i mostly find that when i make *UNKNOWN* , it 's not because of the keyboard , it 's because of the *UNKNOWN* of the screen , , i just ca n't see what i 'm doing as well as a laptop .
as others have noted , i wish the screen was n't so reflective .
and maybe it 's something i need to figure out how to fix , but i do n't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .
has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .
1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .
i want a *UNKNOWN* for *UNKNOWN* , not screen real estate .
, i was willing to *UNKNOWN* my screen size in favor of *UNKNOWN* and speed .
