parking was expensive but i think this is common for *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car .
the parking was free , which was great , and the hotel was *UNKNOWN* located for public transport , and local attractions .
as for in , and , out parking , i have seen a lot of *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* with no car at all .
they have a parking garage , but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park and then if you want to take a drive later , you have to wait for the staff to get it .
there is no real parking space , so i had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .
there was *UNKNOWN* parking at a cost of $ 42 .
rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $ 15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .
our only complaint was one doorman *UNKNOWN* was n't thrilled about us parking the car at the front
parking is easier then you might realize .
there is a parking ramp across the street that is much cheaper then hotel parking .
our room rate was all in order we *UNKNOWN* booked a *UNKNOWN* special , and the front desk had the right rate , and the right parking discount .
of course you have the added thrill of paying over $ 40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .
i found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .
on the other hand , the *UNKNOWN* parking attendant bell people were very friendly .
parking is expensive , rooms are on the small side .
however , parking is $ 30 night and *UNKNOWN* only , which becomes a pain .
only other *UNKNOWN* was $ 38 per night for *UNKNOWN* parking .
room was quiet , clean with good beds but very very *UNKNOWN* a cheap *UNKNOWN* parking was to much *UNKNOWN* but *UNKNOWN* its the location
parking is crazy expensive , we drove up from la so we had a car , but otherwise , you really do n't need it .
parking is expensive and everything is very much within walking distance .
*UNKNOWN* parking is , in my view , *UNKNOWN* high at $ 38 per night , but again we knew this before we arrived so ca n't really complain .
as most hotels in the city , parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it s cheaper to just buy a *UNKNOWN* passport during your stay .
the hotel does have parking , but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .
the parking was steep , so if i had to do it again i would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .
parking at $ 45 a night was outrageous , but probably worth it to keep your car safe .
we did not have a car , hotel parking is expensive .
the *UNKNOWN* parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .
a lot of hotel parking *UNKNOWN* lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .
first , the biggest & *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* & *UNKNOWN* is the mandatory *UNKNOWN* parking .
not trying to bad mouth the *UNKNOWN* , it is a nice place to stay , and if you 're not put off by the *UNKNOWN* parking , you should n't be too disappointed .
*UNKNOWN* parking for $ 40 per night seems a bit steep , but at least the service was efficient and quick .
the prize for *UNKNOWN* parking is steep but i think you can expect that anywhere you go in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* parking was $ 45 per night with tax , but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever i needed it .
watch out for steep parking rates of about $ 45 per night .
this total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory *UNKNOWN* parking .
aside from the parking rate , you wo n't be disappointed .
the other thing that i found disappointing was i ca n't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .
*UNKNOWN* parking is available .
i called before we ever arrived to *UNKNOWN* about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .
i guess calling to *UNKNOWN* about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates did n't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .
*UNKNOWN* parking is provided at $ 36 day which was , i thought , excessive .
*UNKNOWN* has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $ do not rent a car , waste of time , money , no parking !
the *UNKNOWN* parking was *UNKNOWN* , the service was terrible , and the *UNKNOWN* was cold .
at the hotel , it is *UNKNOWN* only parking .
check for internet deals and do n't pay for their parking .
i do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .
the hotel , located a few blocks from fisherman 's wharf as well as *UNKNOWN* square , has a nice *UNKNOWN* theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking *UNKNOWN* .
speaking of parking , you 're going to have to pay and it 's going to have to be *UNKNOWN* service , as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
not only is it *UNKNOWN* at $ 36 day , but having nothing but *UNKNOWN* parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the *UNKNOWN* fetch it from the lot for you .
several have mentioned the charge for parking .
it really does save if you can get a deal with free parking , but the fee is not out of line .
*UNKNOWN* parking was $ 36 a day , but we 're not complaining because other *UNKNOWN* wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the *UNKNOWN* service .
another *UNKNOWN* was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .
they do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won t have to mess with the parking fees .
when i got a great deal $ 99 including parking !
the great thing for us was the free parking .
normally parking is $ 36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .
we stayed at the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* only because they were offering a great winter deal , $ 99 for a room with king , size bed and free parking .
overall , we would recommend this place to friends , especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .
nice rooms , a bit on the smaller side , but parking right at the hotel .
staff were helpful although the *UNKNOWN* parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .
they allowed this , so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .
way too much money to pay for parking , but that is the way it is in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
you do n't need a car because parking is a nightmare .
all these hotels charge parking fees .
parking at the hotel is expensive at $ 32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out *UNKNOWN* .
parking in the city is a royal pain !
although the parking charge is steep , it seems to be the market price in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , or as the locals like to call it :
i notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we did n't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around *UNKNOWN* , and this is quite true .
parking at the hotel was a hefty $ 32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .
parking is an issue in *UNKNOWN* so either pay the $ 30 .
in addition , the *UNKNOWN* parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor , and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told , $ 35 day , which seemed very high .
because of the *UNKNOWN* $ 29 *UNKNOWN* parking fee , we only rented a car for *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* for one day .
you 'll be having fun while some other poor *UNKNOWN* is looking for a parking space that is n't there .
30 am , we discovered that the parking garage next door would not be open until 7 , 7 :
i thought the $ 29 per day parking was ridiculous , but i hear that 's the standard in *UNKNOWN* .
upon arriving , there was a very long and confusing to do with the *UNKNOWN* parking , we had n't gotten our luggage out of th car and the *UNKNOWN* wanted the keys .
there was a fee of $ 29 per day for the parking .
*UNKNOWN* parking attendant was no better .
paid $ 161 plus tax along with a $ 20 parking fee .
as far as parking is concerned , we were shell , shocked at what most of the hotels charge for parking up to $ 40 night .
the *UNKNOWN* is $ 29 night , but if you search for a package rate on their web site , you may get parking included in your room rate .
and , *UNKNOWN* , there is a *UNKNOWN* and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street .
we didnt have or need a car so we didnt have to deal with parking a car i believe it is $ 30 a day , , par for the city .
it is located 2 blocks from the wharf which was outstanding considering parking is hard to come by .
note to those with a car , overnight *UNKNOWN* parking is $ 26 but right next door the car park is $ 15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel , why pay $ 26 ?
parking was $ 26 day , free *UNKNOWN* with on and off *UNKNOWN* .
make sure you realize that you pay for parking .
*UNKNOWN* for *UNKNOWN* parking , but that was okay .
i was *UNKNOWN* , since my $ 89 night room had gone to $ 138 night between the parking and the pet charge .
we did n't pull our car out of the parking garage the whole time we were there .
parking is not cheap , check before you go .
parking was only $ 10 with *UNKNOWN* rate .
hotel parking is now $ 23 a night .
