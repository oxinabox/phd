in fact , the entire navigation structure has been completely revised , i 'm still getting used to it but it 's a huge step forward .
navigation is a huge improvement .
clearly , *UNKNOWN* was hard at work to make navigation quicker and easier .
i tried out the free 14 day trial on newspaper downloads , what a great way to get your news , no advertising distractions , easy to navigate and automatically downloaded every day .
once i got used to it , the navigation was easy too .
the *UNKNOWN* store is cumbersome to navigate , and slow .
despite the lighter text , i prefer the *UNKNOWN* for its *UNKNOWN* and its improved navigation and i use if far more than my *UNKNOWN* .
on the *UNKNOWN* , you have wireless delivery , easy navigation , no ads , no need to flip to page *UNKNOWN* and find the place where you left off .
the main issue i had with *UNKNOWN* 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
it is easy to navigate without any risk of accidentally changing the page i 'm on .
the home page is easier to navigate .
it lets you quickly navigate *UNKNOWN* , moving to the next article with just a click right or left , or up to the section or article list with a flick up or down .
losing the side *UNKNOWN* gives *UNKNOWN* 2 a cleaner look , but it 's the greatly improved navigation that 's the real benefit .
this ease of navigation is one of the most compelling new features of *UNKNOWN* 2 for me .
the problem with *UNKNOWN* and i expect e , readers is that while *UNKNOWN* is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features , *UNKNOWN* does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .
*UNKNOWN* claim 's it 's only 20 % faster , but it feels almost twice as fast , and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .
the pictures were crisp and clear , and it was a quick learning curve to navigate between pages , articles , and sections .
the controls are well placed , and the procedures for navigation are easy to learn .
easy to read , navigate , *UNKNOWN* .
the 5 way navigator is easily worth mentioning .
it makes navigating much easier .
the navigation stick works much better than i expected .
0 out of 5 stars significant improvements to *UNKNOWN* and navigation , *UNKNOWN* 24 , *UNKNOWN*
there are several on , screen navigation improvements due to faster e , ink :
the *UNKNOWN* 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
there is a new 5 , way navigation *UNKNOWN* for left , right , up , down plus press .
i 'm generally enjoying these navigation changes .
it is significantly easier to hold and to navigate relative to the *UNKNOWN* 1 .
this is a beautiful little product it feels sleek and sturdy and *UNKNOWN* in my hands , the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is *UNKNOWN* and easy to learn .
as advertised , it is very easy on the eyes , combined with *UNKNOWN* sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
some *UNKNOWN* ' tables of contents did work as a *UNKNOWN* set of links .
for typing and navigating , the e , ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , , especially for frenetic folks in task mode .
