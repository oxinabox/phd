mediocre room and service for a very extravagant price .
the *UNKNOWN* and support services are phenomenal .
no robes in the rooms , ice machines are not on every floor , no turn down service at night , and when *UNKNOWN* did come , they did not replace the shower gel we had used which was totally empty .
*UNKNOWN* service was fine when we needed our boarding pass printed .
room service was expensive in the hotel .
even with the amount we saved on the room , we could not justify spending the amount they listed for room service .
close to everything , underground eating , *UNKNOWN* avenue shops , walking or short *UNKNOWN* , room service expensive , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* expensive , $ 52 per *UNKNOWN* center cost $ 15 per day
i wo n't be staying here again until i hear that they have upgraded this service .
fantastic view excellent service , top notch !
the service truly was above and beyond .
the palm *UNKNOWN* in the hotel had some specials *UNKNOWN* night , we ate there and the food service , *UNKNOWN* were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big *UNKNOWN* .
we found the service to be fine for our needs .
we do n't use the *UNKNOWN* services or any of the other services unless there is a problem .
we had breakfast included with our hotel package and the buffet was very good and the service at *UNKNOWN* was top notch , but i would never pay $ 26 for it .
excellent service and awesome view .
we didnt use the parking or the gym or the pool and they have technology to remember the guests name when you call the *UNKNOWN* or the guest service they will address you by name .
while the *UNKNOWN* may not have the super high end service and *UNKNOWN* that some of the top *UNKNOWN* hotels have , it is a very nice hotel that i would have no problems recommending to anyone .
the fitness center has good equipment , and room service arrives even faster than they predict in their estimates .
the internet service is reliable and fast , and the desk in the room is large .
the menu prices for room service forget it !
i have in the past called guest services for the loan of a *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* which was previously installed in the room with no problem this time round , i was told there was a flat *UNKNOWN* 50 fee for this , irrespective of the duration of the stay .
also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a *UNKNOWN* conference ' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events service can be slow and erratic , and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !
some of the *UNKNOWN* staff were *UNKNOWN* chilly at times , but the *UNKNOWN* service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .
too bad on several days , they were not able to service the room until late afternoon .
we ordered room service for breakfast and were not disappointed .
my father and i were in town for four days from los *UNKNOWN* to catch a game at *UNKNOWN* stadium , and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating , providing recommendations to us about the attractions , and transportation services .
overall , i think the *UNKNOWN* is a perfectly nice facility and i feel like we got a good deal but i would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .
we were disappointed that the internet service was not free .
the *UNKNOWN* and service line were both just okay .
no greeting when you called them and the service was fine but indifferent .
service was excellent and housing came as soon as asked .
$ 52 a night to park , read very carefully about the room service charges , swimming pool and internet charge in your room , and of course the *UNKNOWN* bar .
guys won t care , women may feel a little ill at ease , but could certainly call room service .
exceptional view and fabulous service .
they have demonstrated a wonderful ability to deliver consistent service and go above and beyond .
he got our heavy bags inside , showed us around the room , explained about room service , *UNKNOWN* .
there s a reason why it s not the holiday *UNKNOWN* and i m assuming you stay there because of the amenities they offer and the service and location and views afforded and so no , you re not going to pay corner diner prices at an upscale hotel .
mom *UNKNOWN* t want to walk too far at night , so after leaving navy pier we came back to the room and i ordered room service for just the second time in my life .
but the service just can t be beat .
ordering soup on room service will set you back around $ 20
, with the tray charge , service charge and taxes making up the bulk of it .
for the location and comfort of the new rooms , this is the perfect hotel , however come armed with your credit card as they appear to be funding the refurbishment through room service and *UNKNOWN* bar charges , not to mention the room rates .
we appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .
rooms , service , location were top notch .
the ideal location coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .
fabulous views amazing service !
great views , location , top notch service .
great stay excellent *UNKNOWN* service .
one thing that really impressed us was the excellent *UNKNOWN* service .
why is it that a $ 69 motel serves free *UNKNOWN* , turns on the *UNKNOWN* when you push power on the remote and has free internet service .
