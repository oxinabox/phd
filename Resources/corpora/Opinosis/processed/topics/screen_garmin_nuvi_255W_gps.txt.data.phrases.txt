it is easy to read and when touching the screen it works great !
and *UNKNOWN* out buttons on the *UNKNOWN* to the same side of the screen which makes it a bit easier .
on the 750 the *UNKNOWN* buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .
the screen is easily *UNKNOWN* in the sun , and i love how it automatically *UNKNOWN* to 20 % at night .
display is excellent , the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top , your speed , the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
the text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the *UNKNOWN* put out for the *UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
the *UNKNOWN* is a plus and i highly recommend it , even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be *UNKNOWN* used for walking directions .
the screen is very bright and easy to see with direct sunlight and at night time .
if you are looking for a simple wide screen *UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is the right choice .
one of my favorite features on the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is the *UNKNOWN* screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .
it tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .
additionally , i find the data in the *UNKNOWN* screen to be *UNKNOWN* .
another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better , especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
, *UNKNOWN* has an *UNKNOWN* at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .
to make things worse , in the the main *UNKNOWN* may not be on the screen on the default scale .
the way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
other than the *UNKNOWN* 's screen being an inch smaller , but really noticeable , the *UNKNOWN* did not have text to voice , and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
the most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read , and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a *UNKNOWN* just as you need to turn .
on the other hand , after about a week of using the *UNKNOWN* , it seems to understand where we are , and now *UNKNOWN* as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .
the screen is easy to see , the voice tells you where you are and it 's very accurate .
i switched to the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* after the screen on my *UNKNOWN* 760 got cracked .
*UNKNOWN* same screen size as the other 4 .
*UNKNOWN* better screen touch sensitivity
*UNKNOWN* more responsive that my old 760 , plus a better looking screen
the home screen shows four options :
any time you are viewing the map , you can *UNKNOWN* in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .
i have noticed that when i see a speed limit sign on the road , indicating a change of speed limit for that road , the *UNKNOWN* is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
if you missed the spoken directions , you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
so , although the *UNKNOWN* does n't *UNKNOWN* those directions , i can look at the screen to see the exit i need to take .
the screen is bright and the maps are generally good .
3 love the touch screen technology
there were a few times i drove under overpasses on the interstate and no intersection was shown on the screen .
typical of *UNKNOWN* , the product works well , wide screen is very nice .
*UNKNOWN* the only slight problem is that on my unit i have to press pretty hard on the screen if i want to *UNKNOWN* drag ' the map .
the extra features of the *UNKNOWN* over lesser models that i find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
now the only screen i get says the system software is missing .
i use the suction cup mount because i like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head , but i make sure to take it with me when i park my car .
from the map screen it 's but 2 presses on the large and accessible *UNKNOWN* to get a where am i ?
i also realize that even if i crashed differently i had been injured in other ways but the car were still *UNKNOWN* that it 's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services from that lovely screen that told me where i was .
i just wish the screen is larger .
1 wanted a wide screen model , its difficult to see the 4
4 it has built in picture viewer and a card slot , so insert your memory card , *UNKNOWN* to picture browser and you do n't need a *UNKNOWN* , has enough big screen to enjoy
its for wide screen models and it fits perfectly my *UNKNOWN* with a flap that covers it screen .
i chose a hard type of case that *UNKNOWN* the screen in , as i did n't want the possibility of it sliding out .
also , it 's hard to view the screen when it 's super sunny outside , but the text to speech capability is an advantage .
before i get into the specifics of my review , let me offer one important piece of advice , , buy a carrying case to protect the screen !
these *UNKNOWN* have sensitive *UNKNOWN* menus , and i think the fact that i did n't protect the screen on my last *UNKNOWN* is the reason it died after only 14 months .
i had a *UNKNOWN* 205 and i really liked it but i wanted a bigger screen .
it 's an emergency location feature , you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .
but , in direct sunlight , the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .
not only the voice gives turn , by , turn instructions , the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
the local speed limit is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
one thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .
having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since i was in unfamiliar territory .
i watched the screen several times as i passed by a speed limit sign , and it would change almost immediately as i passed by !
