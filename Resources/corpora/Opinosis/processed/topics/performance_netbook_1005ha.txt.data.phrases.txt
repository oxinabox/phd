the *UNKNOWN* super hybrid engine utility lets users *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* their *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* 's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
in super performance mode *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .
one word of advice is to be really careful about which *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these *UNKNOWN* .
whatever you elect to install i would highly recommend you benchmark the performance both before and after .
i expect to get 6 , 7 hours in high performance mode .
faster overall performance , and shorter charge life on the battery .
*UNKNOWN* ' center of *UNKNOWN* is in very reliable , very stable , high performance *UNKNOWN* , mainly *UNKNOWN* .
i have the super hybrid engine set to auto mode , which i 'm guessing is less than high or super performance .
comes with unusually well , written documentation , though i 'm still a little fuzzy on the different power , saving performance *UNKNOWN* :
overall though , i am happy with the performance .
4 pass , battery life is amazing , used the laptop in super performance mode for over 6 hours of watching videos , checking email , connecting with *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* broadband card , and still had battery life *UNKNOWN* .
as for the performance of this little computer , i 've *UNKNOWN* tell *UNKNOWN* :
the performance is great for it 's size , remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .
just some advice , use *UNKNOWN* 's *UNKNOWN* , virus and not *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , ca or the like , if not you will loose a lot in performance .
upgrade to *UNKNOWN* of memory , but did not seem to make much different in performance in either *UNKNOWN* or windows 7 .
i find that the performance is great for my use on just *UNKNOWN* that comes with it .
i keep a couple of *UNKNOWN* running and its performance is great .
the reviews on many of the higher resolutions *UNKNOWN* also stated poor video and processing performance .
i have n't hit my swap yet in several weeks of heavy use , and performance has been more than satisfactory for what i do with it .
replacing them is n't very hard given a *UNKNOWN* and five minutes , and doing so noticeably ups the performance .
otherwise its performance has been bug , free and met all expectations .
it enhances performance , but is not absolutely necessary because this unit is a full featured machine .
the wireless performance is great .
0 out of 5 stars excellent balance of performance and value , *UNKNOWN* 23 , *UNKNOWN*
i am very satisfied with the performance of the atom processor .
this did not affect me much , i can write without problems full university texts , media files run without any problem and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in high performance mode without depleted .
the small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop , the long battery life is really great , and the speed and performance using various *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* connections was better than i expected it to be .
the only area that i 've seen , so far , where the performance is not adequate , is with some streaming videos , but that 's not important to me .
0 out of 5 stars *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and performance , *UNKNOWN* 14 , *UNKNOWN*
i 'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this *UNKNOWN* but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .
i then loaded windows 7 *UNKNOWN* and the performance has been great .
after upgrading to *UNKNOWN* of memory and *UNKNOWN* useless pre , installed software , performance has not been an issues .
i have the following software installed and they work great , modest but *UNKNOWN* performance reduction :
no noticeable performance reduction
performance reduction here is much less than *UNKNOWN* would suggest .
my desktop is a very strong dual , core computer running windows 7 and i cant see a performance decrease doing everyday things on the *UNKNOWN* .
1 light weight , 2 long battery life , and 3 reasonable performance .
performance is good , screen very good , wireless very good , numerous *UNKNOWN* ports , and keyboard layout is excellent .
battery performance could n't be more nice , as well as performance .
been very pleased with performance and battery life , however power supply went out after 60 days .
the performance is fantastic , opening a browser , establishing wireless connection , opening *UNKNOWN* documents , opening *UNKNOWN* files and word documents is comparable to my newest desktop *UNKNOWN* .
i had thought the ram was too small for good performance but i was wrong .
i spent a bit of time researching the various *UNKNOWN* currently available and thought that the *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* had a nice mix of style , battery life , *UNKNOWN* , and performance .
the performance and speed of this laptop is amazing .
i was *UNKNOWN* about its capabilities while buying it but after using it for 15 odd days , i am very satisfied with its performance .
i use this setting but it should n't be used for movies as it inhibits performance during *UNKNOWN* .
there 's only 1 *UNKNOWN* of ram , and that 's good enough for me since i 'll only be running low , performance applications .
it *UNKNOWN* me out since i was n't running anything high performance .
0 out of 5 stars good *UNKNOWN* , exceptional battery , performance meets expectations .
very acceptable performance for what *UNKNOWN* are designed to do .
