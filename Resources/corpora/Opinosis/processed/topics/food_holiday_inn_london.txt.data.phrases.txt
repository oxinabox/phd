the room was packed to capacity with *UNKNOWN* at the food *UNKNOWN* .
the over zealous staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .
there are a couple pubs , a great *UNKNOWN* and even fast food restaurants within a block .
the neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from fast food to up , scale with a wide variety of *UNKNOWN* , , we never had a bad meal .
the food was wonderful , a selection of sandwiches , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and spicy wedge potato 's , fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed .
full *UNKNOWN* breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed , staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time .

i ca n't see what sets it apart from other 3 , star hotels i 've stayed in , other than the fact it 's in *UNKNOWN* , in a posh area and has good food .
we ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was *UNKNOWN* for the quality of food .
there are plenty of restaurants in the area as well , including fast food joints and two small , *UNKNOWN* supermarkets .
they also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food , great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
breakfast equally tired , although a reasonable selection of food , general *UNKNOWN* in restaurant more like a youth hostel .
the breakfast buffet full *UNKNOWN* breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food .
really nice hotel for *UNKNOWN* much around in terms of *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* was *UNKNOWN*
everything about this hotel was first class including the food !
the *UNKNOWN* surprise was how fantastic the food was which i had n't expected in a large chain hotel .
it is very convenient to the *UNKNOWN* road tube stop , grocery store , drug store and fast food places .
i ordered room service one night , and the food was delightful , and the service was fast and friendly .
the location is just around the corner from the tube , boots and *UNKNOWN* right next door , close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .
talking about food , something worth noticing is that there was a *UNKNOWN* in the room , but it was completely reserved for the *UNKNOWN* , bar service beverages , which completely filled it .

we ate on evening once at the *UNKNOWN* pub in the mall , it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .

as mentioned , there are several places to buy food if you 're going cheap :
the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* and various fast food joints and restaurants nearby .
shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out , this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style *UNKNOWN* so lukewarm food and very busy .

food is *UNKNOWN* everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .
there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area , but the food costs are always high , we ate mostly at pubs , where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !
more than enough food choices with coffee or tea , juice , pastries , toast , yogurt , cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .
another good thing is that the rooms have *UNKNOWN* , fridges and it 's great for storing ready , to , eat food from *UNKNOWN* .
they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from *UNKNOWN* to desserts at a fraction of the cost .
