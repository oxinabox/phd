all in all , a normal chain hotel on a nice location , i will be back if i do not find *UNKNOWN* closer to *UNKNOWN* for a better price .
great price terrific location .
our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .
all for the bargain price off 250 for 2 nights including return rail to north *UNKNOWN* .
explore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price .
half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid , but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view .
the price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .
i got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary , for about 80 a night *UNKNOWN* taxes , however after reading reviews about this hotel i was very worried about staying here .
breakfast is *UNKNOWN* , but not worth paying for if it 's not included in your room price .
if you 're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please , this is a good place for you .
all in all , it was a decent hotel , but i think i may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price .
we ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was *UNKNOWN* for the quality of food .
for the price and location , this was a very great hotel .
price was unbeatable , just 79 pounds night .
we got this for $ 75 a night , which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find .
our *UNKNOWN* and one dinner meal were included in our price .
one day late and i paid the same price for a better room in hi *UNKNOWN* , the supposedly better classed hi nearby .
if you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a *UNKNOWN* who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then do n't stay here .
*UNKNOWN* the staff is very *UNKNOWN* had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible .
for the price and the location i thought this place was great .
good pub nearby with wonderful *UNKNOWN* and meals at a good price .
as previous reviewers have said , there 's a variety of shops nearby and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there .
and fully intend to come back again , if the price is right .
i booked this one as none of my favorites were available and i was amazed at the *UNKNOWN* price offered .
very happy with the hotel for the price .
overall for the price i think it was extremely good value .
the biggest disappointment was the price of internet .
however , if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience , i 'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city .
but there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
great hotel for a great price .
i used *UNKNOWN* ' name your own price and my bid of a $ 100 night was *UNKNOWN* for a *UNKNOWN* and a *UNKNOWN* night .
good hotel for the price nice location .
it 's nicer than certain other hotels you 'd get in the same price range on *UNKNOWN* and all in all was nice .
i would n't say it stands out particularly , but if you 're looking for a reliable , convenient , comfortable place in *UNKNOWN* , this is a great place to stay , , especially if you can get it at a good price on *UNKNOWN* or another site like that .
nothing that spectacular to justify the price .
it 's an okay hotel , and i do n't mind staying there again if i get it for a cheap price through *UNKNOWN* .
restaurant , make sure to try *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* restaurants , delicious and good price .
but again , the location could justify charging that price .
thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid .
the price was exceptional for the *UNKNOWN* area , and as many reviewers have mentioned , it is a two or three minute walk to the *UNKNOWN* tube station .
all , in , all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .
i booked this hotel via holiday *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* nights for the price off 1 .
good price location but no *UNKNOWN* .
got decent price on *UNKNOWN* as well .
overall , for the price , it is a pretty good deal .
good price through *UNKNOWN* in general is in good *UNKNOWN* :
i would not stay at this holiday *UNKNOWN* again unless the price was halved , because there are simply too many places offering better value in *UNKNOWN* .
breakfast was appalling , plenty of it , you certainly won t starve , but the quality was awful considering the price paid .
i was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade , for the price of 35 pounds a night .
all in all a pleasant stay for a good price .
although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price .
in particular , there was a nice indian run coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on *UNKNOWN* road that served a good *UNKNOWN* breakfast at a decent price .
would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price i got on *UNKNOWN* combined with the great , convenient location , which made it easy to get to all the *UNKNOWN* sites in *UNKNOWN* .
staff very friendly and i always worry when booking through *UNKNOWN* that i will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the *UNKNOWN* eye .
just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .
i would *UNKNOWN* out as the evening food is frozen re , heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .
however , the first price that they charged me was too much so i had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .
, *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* style bar *UNKNOWN* ventilation on a smoking *UNKNOWN* 's not worth the hotel web , site price of 160 for *UNKNOWN* room .
in short it 's a good hotel if you get the price off *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* and not the hotel web , site price of 160 .
we 've stayed in *UNKNOWN* a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors , the location , the price the *UNKNOWN* of a room to accomodate three adults .
