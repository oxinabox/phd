drivers seat not comfortable , the car itself compared to other models of similar class .
it 's very comfortable , remarkably large inside and just an overall great vehicle .
front seats are very uncomfortable .
i 'm 6 ' tall , and find the driving position pretty comfortable .
however , there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1 terrible driver seat comfort , kills my back 2 lack luster interior design , my *UNKNOWN* has much better comfort 3 the *UNKNOWN* drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is *UNKNOWN* enough to be an annoyance .
the seats are extremely uncomfortable .
while the accord is no *UNKNOWN* it is a close relative in terms of quality and comfort .
i previously owned a 98 *UNKNOWN* , and found the seats more comfortable than the *UNKNOWN* .
i 'm very sad , i loved my daughter 's civic and the dealer service is fantastic , but even good service ca n't help the uncomfortable seats .
overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
the ride is a great balance between handling and comfort .
although it is fun to drive and quality seems *UNKNOWN* , the leather seats are very uncomfortable , especially on a long drive .
although not the fastest , most luxurious , or *UNKNOWN* advanced in the very competitive mid , size sedan segment , the accord strikes the perfect balance of sport , comfort and value , creating a vehicle that feels and acts like a much pricier machine .
has lots of features , is comfortable , everything works .
the two door *UNKNOWN* is very comfortable and roomy and draws plenty of attention .
the seat is extremely uncomfortable .
the driver 's seat is very uncomfortable .
the head rest *UNKNOWN* forward which pushes the driver 's head forward at a very uncomfortable position .
the front driver seat 's *UNKNOWN* support seemed very uncomfortable at first .
the car is comfortable and quiet .
no big deal the car is huge and very comfortable .
very tight , runs great , very comfortable to drive .
the interior quality is *UNKNOWN* , my 1999 accord *UNKNOWN* had a better comfort level on the seats .
initially the *UNKNOWN* controls were a little intimidating , but it does n't take long to get comfortable with them .
i fit in the *UNKNOWN* comfortably .
the driver seating is uncomfortable .
it 's a comfortable ride and is very high quality .
for a 4 cylinder car i am surprised at the comfortable and *UNKNOWN* drive .
this a good choice if you need an affordable and comfortable commuting vehicle but hate the idea of a boring *UNKNOWN* sedan .
what a car , design , ride , comfort , 270 *UNKNOWN* audio system , i love this car .
the seats are very comfortable & supportive .
i like my accord very much , but had i known the drivers seat was so uncomfortable i would have never bought it .
aside from missing the turbo 's acceleration , i 've preferred the accord 's better mileage , handling and comfort .
this accord is the only large car i found with upscale comfort amenities and a good manual transmission .
comfort inside is better than expected .
my family of 5 can comfortably ride in this car .
this car is a dream from the gas to the style to the comfort .
its the most comfortable accord i have had .
i do find the *UNKNOWN* on the driver 's seat a bit uncomfortable though .
the car is very comfortable , the steering is tight and precise .
the seats are comfortable , and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .
most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle i have ever owned .

i would recommend this car for great value , comfort , & fun to drive !
seats are firm but not uncomfortable , very *UNKNOWN* like .
rides with comfort and motor will pick up if you need it .
it gives a *UNKNOWN* driving feel and offers a very comfortable highway ride .
uncomfortable in *UNKNOWN* , had a *UNKNOWN* before , rough ride .
test drove *UNKNOWN* and enjoyed the firm yet very comfortable ride .
it 's very comfortable , has pretty much every luxury feature you might want , and is still fun to drive .
do n't rely on your test drive , the seats are very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the *UNKNOWN* mode the vehicle shifts rocks violently forward and when leaving the *UNKNOWN* mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is continuously shaking and rocking .
seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !
my only complaint is comfort .
