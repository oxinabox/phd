as always , the video screen is sharp and bright .
2 , inch screen and a glossy , polished aluminum finish that one *UNKNOWN* editor described as looking like a *UNKNOWN* tree *UNKNOWN* .
still , video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen , such as the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* touch .
2 , inch screen can now display up to 12 lines of menu text and the now playing screen lists artist , album , and title information in three *UNKNOWN* , more *UNKNOWN* lines at the top of the screen .
apple 's *UNKNOWN* click wheel navigation can still be found on the front of the device , just below the curved glass screen .
it looks great , is easy to handle , the screen is a good size and nice and clear , and the controls are very sensitive to the touch .
and the 5th generation has a larger screen size than the previous models .
i 've owned all the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* at one point and i can honestly say that i love the screen as it 's good for *UNKNOWN* viewing of a movie or show .
however , it does n't have the touch screen capability .
it 's really amazing just how big the screen is on such an incredibly thin device .
the picture on the small screen is surprisingly clear and easy to view .
new features like *UNKNOWN* screen and radio is a major plus .
the screen and built in speaker .
the screen is easy to read and the built in speaker works well .
the larger screen is a great plus .
do n't waste your money on those 200 dollar *UNKNOWN* or the new version of the *UNKNOWN* that is *UNKNOWN* and is n't even as good as the 5th generation *UNKNOWN* !
video , motion sensing , screen size and *UNKNOWN* look i recently upgraded from the 2nd generation *UNKNOWN* and love the new features of the newest model .
easy to use this new *UNKNOWN* is easy to use , has great features like a radio , and a nice screen .
good features , small and light weight but a big screen .
the video camera is great and the screen size is a nice size
does do much in a very tiny space , bigger screen , , more features than previous models .
there are *UNKNOWN* of new features in this model and a much larger screen .
screen scratches easily wanted an *UNKNOWN* to listen to in the car .
has bigger screen , video camera .
what i also like is that it has a bigger screen than the regular *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
i found a lovely *UNKNOWN* case with screen protection on *UNKNOWN* , and i think the gift worked out great .
the screen is bigger so i can watch movies .
i love the *UNKNOWN* , and the larger screen , and the radio .
good screen quality bought as a *UNKNOWN* gift and they love it .
slim , size , *UNKNOWN* camera , screen clarity , photo playing mode .
what 's more , even if i cut a long essay into chips with *UNKNOWN* binary limit for each one , some of them may still be *UNKNOWN* through the note reader since the wheel just simply does n't work out to scroll the screen down .
price , size , screen , *UNKNOWN* radio , camera , capacity , scroll wheel , *UNKNOWN* .
the battery is great and the screen as well .
the larger screen is a plus for sure .
screen resolution is awesome .
lack of a belt clip accessory that also protects the screen .
the only negative thing i would say is that i can not find a sleeve *UNKNOWN* a belt clip like i had for my 2nd *UNKNOWN* , it was *UNKNOWN* and protected the screen and thumb wheel .
easy to use video camera , big screen , fun color .
also the screen i love how big it and , how easy you can read the playlist the color rocks !
screen does not scratch , but can get fingerprints easily .
very easy to use , love the *UNKNOWN* , lightweight , thin , nice screen , great sound , battery lasts much longer than stated .
but i 'm really disappointed they did n't keep the same finish as last year 's *UNKNOWN* finish , last year 's model never got fingerprints , except on the screen itself , and looked new at all times .
nice size screen , good speakers for size , great new features , tons of colors to choose from , easy to use .
video is impressive , speaker sound is good for size , easy menus , screen is big enough to watch movies .
watched one last night in bed while *UNKNOWN* was sleeping and screen is big enough .
the old *UNKNOWN* stuff fits but no openings for camera lens & this screen a bit larger .
new features , bigger screen .
now all it needs is a camera that can take still *UNKNOWN* , maybe a bigger screen , a built in *UNKNOWN* , and internet buy it if you 're looking for a good *UNKNOWN* !
small size and color , *UNKNOWN* your money 's worth , nice screen , and video camera .
same as last model with some differences in screen size a 2 .
the *UNKNOWN* and camera are great , speaker is great for video *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* movie watching , the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but lighter than the 4th *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* !
if these get much smaller , though , i wo n't be able to read the screen .
it 's small and lightweight , it looks amazing , the video quality is way better than i ever imagined it would be , and the screen is huge .
i like the *UNKNOWN* radio , have an audio book and even downloaded a movie on it , , small screen but is *UNKNOWN* .
i bought the *UNKNOWN* as a replacement for an older classic , which was a great unit but time has taken it 's toll on the battery and screen .
this is a vast improvement on the last *UNKNOWN* , with a bigger screen and more capacity .
