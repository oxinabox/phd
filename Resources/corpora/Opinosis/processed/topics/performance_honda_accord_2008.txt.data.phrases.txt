very happy with my *UNKNOWN* accord , performance is quite adequate it has nice looks and is a great long , distance cruiser .
6 , 4 , 3 *UNKNOWN* engine has poor performance and gas mileage of 22 highway .
overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
i 'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .

the performance of the engine is very smooth .
this car had *UNKNOWN* at 500 miles and has horrible performance even for a four cylinder .
great performance and handling make this a real winner !
engine performance lacks punch after 60 , head rest are poor design , lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c , radio system is marginal compared to *UNKNOWN* , seats are hard and small for a large person .
there seem to be so many components that enter into the *UNKNOWN* that performance can vary widely from car to car .
features , quality , reliability , and performance , at a price no other car maker can touch .
190 *UNKNOWN* engine is a good compromise for performance and fuel economy .
i owned this car for only a week , but i am pleasantly surprised by its performance and build quality .

the bigger size has taken some getting used to , but the additional horsepower compared to the *UNKNOWN* and the performance are like night and day .
it fits right , is fun to drive , great stereo , fuel economy , performance .
if you want sports sedan handling and performance , then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !
i went for comfort over performance to fit it in my budget so the *UNKNOWN* , l with the 4 *UNKNOWN* engine .
i researched many other makes and models but for the performance , quality , and style , the accord won hands down for cars under $ *UNKNOWN* .

lots of power with the 6 *UNKNOWN* , and the car has a great balance of style , performance , and reliability .
no problem with quality , performance , *UNKNOWN* .
engine performance is very lacking .
t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets , namely performance , but sadly to say , in others , it surpasses .
the 4 cylinder lacks performance and handling and the gas saving is only minimal .
the car is great , both with *UNKNOWN* and performance .
i purchased a 2004 *UNKNOWN* , leather and i did not think *UNKNOWN* could do any better with design or performance .
i love the *UNKNOWN* the performance and handling .
i was looking for a luxury , feel car with great performance at a good price .
overweight , *UNKNOWN* pounds , lots of road noise , and the combined performance of the *UNKNOWN* and the grade logic automatic transmission *UNKNOWN* this a miserable driver .
the interior design and the performance of the *UNKNOWN* are the highlights .
i was looking for a mid size *UNKNOWN* with style , performance and all season traction capability .
*UNKNOWN* in and out is fantastic , and the *UNKNOWN* , 6 performance is all one would hope for and more .
it does not diminish the performance of the car , it is just annoying .
after tracking almost 2 months of research on *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* mid , size car models , only two stands out for their performance , reliability and safety , *UNKNOWN* accord and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .

i could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car .
when i first tested the *UNKNOWN* , l *UNKNOWN* , the performance and handling of the car sold me , i had to get it and i did .
*UNKNOWN* has outdone itself on *UNKNOWN* and performance .
its ride , comfort and overall performance is an absolute joy .
the previous models were boring both *UNKNOWN* and performance wise .
