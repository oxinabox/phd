after i plugged it in to my *UNKNOWN* hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !
after you have *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* a 500 , page book one , page , at , a , time to get from chapter 2 to chapter 15 , see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there !
no user *UNKNOWN* battery , , unless you buy the extended warranty for $ 65 .
after 1 year you pay $ 80 plus shipping to send the device to *UNKNOWN* and have the *UNKNOWN* replaced , not the battery changed out .
the fact that *UNKNOWN* 2 has no *UNKNOWN* card capability and the battery is not user , *UNKNOWN* is not an issue with me .
things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages the separate *UNKNOWN* on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see the occasionally awkward menus the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
the issue with the battery door opening is thus solved , but *UNKNOWN* went further , eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .
frankly , i never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my *UNKNOWN* 1 but i liked that they were there and i miss them on the *UNKNOWN* 2 , even though , i have to admit , i do n't actually need them .
it 's also easy to charge the *UNKNOWN* in the car if you have a battery *UNKNOWN* with a *UNKNOWN* port .
you ca n't carry an extra battery , though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it 's almost a non , issue , and you ca n't replace the battery because of the *UNKNOWN* , like fixed backing .
for one thing , there 's no charge except battery power no *UNKNOWN* intended !
