we had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy , considering the small hotel rooms i have in previous trips to *UNKNOWN* .
the room was quiet , clean , the bed and *UNKNOWN* were comfortable , and the service was adequate .
we arrived about 11 am , room was ready .
room was good size for *UNKNOWN* , clean throughout .
the *UNKNOWN* desk called our room to ask if we needed any information or assistance .
room was plenty big enough and clean and *UNKNOWN* , bed was *UNKNOWN* .
first , we walked in and the restroom door was broken .
our room was typical holiday *UNKNOWN* the bathroom could have done with updating but was *UNKNOWN* .
our rooms were not ready , we were promised rooms at a later time , *UNKNOWN* .
my room was positively huge by *UNKNOWN* standards .
the bed was perfectly comfortable , i had ample desk space for my work and my bathroom was much bigger than i expected .
my friends were given a two bed room which was considerably smaller but , like mine , was clean and stocked with the necessities .
early check , in only allowed smoking room , but it was entirely acceptable , and only the hallway had faint *UNKNOWN* odor .
rooms in the hotel are very small , as is the double bed .
the room was tired with *UNKNOWN* wallpaper although it was renovated recently .
it is common across *UNKNOWN* to have small rooms and this was small for a double .
the public areas are fine if bland , the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped , the location good for tube and bus but just a little *UNKNOWN* distant ' .
the rooms have an electric tea kettle and the tea and cream is provided .
the room was clean but tired as were the public areas that we saw .
the bedroom , although recently upgraded with a new bed had wall paper that was *UNKNOWN* at the *UNKNOWN* throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand , the *UNKNOWN* was an outdated model .
the room was quiet apart from the *UNKNOWN* of the *UNKNOWN* .
the room was packed to capacity with *UNKNOWN* at the food *UNKNOWN* .
the over zealous staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .
room was comfortable , very well lighted , and well maintained by *UNKNOWN* staff .
only negative was that the room , fitted with twin beds , was small even for just two adults .
the hotel was clean and the room was a decent size .
paid for an executive room and it was not big enough for a family of 3 .
there was no room once sofa bed was down as we had to climb over it to get to toilet once our daughter was in bed .
room and bathroom was very clean .
after many phone calls and visits to the front desk regarding not being able to connect with the internet i was finally told it was not working in our room and they knew that it was n't when we checked in .
but i really liked the hotel , the rooms were decently sized , there was a nice bank of lifts in the lobby , and again , the staff was friendly , which goes a long way when you 've just got off a ten hour flight .
our room was *UNKNOWN* by *UNKNOWN* standards and had all the amenities we needed .
also , one of my colleagues wanted to leave his room key for his wife but the front desk staff would n't allow him to do so .
our room was smaller than expected .
i have experience with the small size of some *UNKNOWN* hotels , but this hotel room was the smallest i have encountered .
the price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .
the double room is small as in most of *UNKNOWN* and only one person can walk by the bed at a time .
there were a few marks and *UNKNOWN* on wallpaper *UNKNOWN* but overall room was in good shape and both room and bath were clean .
the rooms were small but adequate and the empty *UNKNOWN* was a great *UNKNOWN* .
the room was *UNKNOWN* with a nice selection of *UNKNOWN* in the bathroom which were re , stocked each day , also the bottle of water , fresh orange and kit *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* left each day was a nice touch too .
*UNKNOWN* were fine for what was needed and when a *UNKNOWN* pillow was requested i was greeted with a friendly confirmation it was on its way .
rooms were well *UNKNOWN* from outside noise .
our room rate included two full *UNKNOWN* , free bottled water and *UNKNOWN* candy bars each day and was very competitive with the rates at other hotels we considered .
not sure what the regular rate is for a room , but i personally would not pay more than $ 100 for this hotel .
in , room internet is *UNKNOWN* expensive at 15 pounds per day .
the room was clean , *UNKNOWN* a good size and *UNKNOWN* quiet .
i made the reservation 2 *UNKNOWN* ago requesting for 2 connecting rooms and was told could not guarantee connecting rooms until later .
she called *UNKNOWN* , and the room was ready in 10 minutes !
the room was a perfect size , *UNKNOWN* clean , and well equipped .
after returning from our dinner the staff had left a bottle of wine in the room and a card wishing us a happy anniversary , such a lovely touch !
they currently appear to be *UNKNOWN* the rooms once this is one i am sure it will be even better !
had requested a double room , not available at time of booking and no notes in the reservation about this but we could have had a double if we had wanted to wait .
the room was about what we expected from a holiday *UNKNOWN* although we could have used a bottle or can opener given that there was no *UNKNOWN* bar .
we stayed at the beginning and end of our trip , and both times our double room was clean , comfortable , and a good size .
first was about a short *UNKNOWN* , then about that he needed to go to the back room to check out if he could give me a double room instead of single and the *UNKNOWN* time that the printer was slow .
the room was *UNKNOWN* , but wallpaper were *UNKNOWN* on few places .
we were very pleased with our room which also had *UNKNOWN* as it was very hot in *UNKNOWN* at that time .
we had two rooms with an *UNKNOWN* door which was a perfect arrangement and the accessible room had plenty of room for the wheelchair with a big bathroom .
my room was good size for *UNKNOWN* standards , and had recently been overhauled and included hair dryer , *UNKNOWN* , and air conditioning .
getting to the rooms was slowed by construction crews working on other floors and a horrible elevator which requires your room key to operate .
the lobby was big but the room was very small , i wo n't stay there any more .
if you upgraded to the next level room , the *UNKNOWN* was stocked .
had it not been for the hotel confirmation that i made a copy of they did not want to give us a room even though it was already paid for months in advance .
my room was very clean , bed was *UNKNOWN* and always made by the time i arrived back each day .
room size is fine as of *UNKNOWN* standard , it 's clean and *UNKNOWN* .
room and service , our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
even though i requested a true king or queen bed , our room was a 2 twin that was hastily assembled into a king which meant that one of us was always falling into the gap between the beds .
the beds were not very comfortable and the door to the bathroom was a sliding door that did not lock .
, *UNKNOWN* in room was a bit dated .
, room was smaller than i thought it was going to be .
a c either ineffective or not turned on but was just spring , so room was comfortable cool with window opened for fresh air .
the room was very reasonably priced , but very small .
the beds were comfortable , but the bathroom was tiny as well .
the hotel is huge and our room was on the large side for *UNKNOWN* .
it was a good quality room although the bed was and *UNKNOWN* were very firm .
they changed our room for the rest of our stay but the room was not as nice and had a smaller folding bed .
what we got was a room where the hotel wall was on the left side and a roof under our window with full of cabbage .
room was n't that big but looks like brand new , bed was very *UNKNOWN* .
bathroom also was very clean with no smell of chemistry .
they also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food , great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
the room was tiny , and the heater did n't work properly , the staff if great .
it is a great location , the rooms are a bit basic , but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .
let 's face it , just because the hotel is 4 star does not mean your room will be , but this really is n't too bad .
the room also had a *UNKNOWN* which is great to store orange juice and anything else you might need , but the *UNKNOWN* really could have used a good scrubbing !
on the plus side , the staff in the breakfast room was wonderful and friendly , as was the fine waitress the one night we had dessert at the ground , floor restaurant .
when we tried to use a phone card from our room it would not work so i asked the front *UNKNOWN* to help me and was told they could n't really !
our room was small and the wooden furniture was badly chipped and marked .
i was *UNKNOWN* upgraded ' to a room that was n't stunning or large , hate to think what regular room is like .
not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in *UNKNOWN* unless you compromise on a few things , such as cost , location *UNKNOWN* .
we had an executive room and was disappointed to find that the extra bed was not done up and we had to call *UNKNOWN* to fold down the metal bed .
the room was very nice with a king size bed and a full size double sofa bed which was very comfortable and easy to use .
i ordered room service one night , and the food was delightful , and the service was fast and friendly .
i really can not comment on the rate because we had a package deal for the entire trip , and i do n't have a clue what our room rate was .
our room was small but *UNKNOWN* .
i do wish they had double rooms with double beds , but i was so exhausted when i went to be , i do n't believe i even turned over , so i managed with the twin bed just fine .
the rooms are quite small but everything we needed was there .
the refrigerator did not work , and when we asked about it were informed that a refrigerator did not come with our room , even though it was in the room .
after realizing that the room was *UNKNOWN* smoking we went downstairs to change rooms and they told us the entire hotel was booked .
the hotel room was very clean and the cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very attentive .
check , in was simple , and we made our way to the room in an elevator lift that whisked us up to the 20th floor in a matter of seconds .
the room was clean , organized , and provided a great view of *UNKNOWN* .
we requested a room on a high floor before we left and this wish was granted with a 15th floor room with a view for miles it was great !
the room size was as expected , bigger then hotels in south beach , yet smaller then some resorts in the *UNKNOWN* , however that being said , the room size is more than enough and we had several pieces of luggage in the room .
standard rooms in this hotel fall far short of usual *UNKNOWN* four , star standard , they are small , have no safe , pants press or other amenities usually provided .
the room was nice size with a small but adequate bathroom .
the room was clean , the bathroom large enough , and i had a choice of *UNKNOWN* .
if i had paid more than $ 100 for my room , i would have been disappointed .
my husband and i stayed in one of their suites a few years ago over *UNKNOWN* and the only complaint i had about it was that the sofa in the living room of the suite was as hard as a rock .
talking about food , something worth noticing is that there was a *UNKNOWN* in the room , but it was completely reserved for the *UNKNOWN* , bar service beverages , which completely filled it .
we were able to find an internet deal and got a double room for about 100 night and i 'd definitely suggest you to immediately book this hotel if you 're lucky to find some similar offer .
check in was very easy , we we happy to learn that our room was ready at *UNKNOWN* and they up graded our room .
if this is your first time to the *UNKNOWN* and you travel a lot in the us , the room size is small .
the room is very clean and modern , everyday it was cleaned and fresh towels were given even when we didnt put them on the floor .
the lobby was absolutely *UNKNOWN* when i arrived , mostly tourists but some airline crew too , the room was small , and the *UNKNOWN* was too .
the bathroom was also tiny , and the water pressure *UNKNOWN* low .
bed was comfortable , but the room was very hot , even with the window open .
30 to find our room was ready and the receptionist very helpful and friendly and my special requests had been noted and acted on .
the room itself was clean but very dated think early '90s blue and yellow with pine !
but , the room was bright and airy and a decent size .
when i tried to check in early the receptionist persuaded me to purchase an *UNKNOWN* upgrade ' to an executive room as that was available but the regular room that i booked was n't .
tiny room , dated furniture , the dirt from my shoes was n't removed by the cleaners during my stay .
the room was a little smaller than typical us hotels but very comfortable .
staff were very pleasant , especially the breakfast staff rooms were not particularly *UNKNOWN* but were clean and adequate , bathroom was modern but shower was not very powerful .
when i finally got my turn she said four words to me , name sorry i *UNKNOWN* out my name credit card i did think for a moment that she might say pin or tell me my room number but obviously i *UNKNOWN* worth the effort .
the room was a bog standard room , poorly lit with no light on the desk or indeed within 6 feet of it , a noisy *UNKNOWN* heater and a *UNKNOWN* that you cant see from the sofa , you have to sit on the bed .
room service is expensive but good , the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired holiday *UNKNOWN* room service menu , when i ordered a 6 .
, but after i called room service it was promptly fixed .
the room was *UNKNOWN* and clean and the bed *UNKNOWN* with the option to choose from 5 or 6 different kind of *UNKNOWN* depending on your needs or allergies *UNKNOWN* .
the website offers a standard room for less money , but we were told by the hotel that the only way to be guaranteed a non , smoking room was to upgrade to a king , so we paid extra .
let me just say that the bed was king size , but the room was tiny and the bed took up most of it .
it was clean , but the room was rather tired looking and needed to be updated badly .
people are saying the rooms are small but one i was in was very much the holiday *UNKNOWN* standard size room and was in good condition .
view was excellent from the room although weather was terrible during my stay .
the rooms are very small and can feel kind of cramped when changing and stuff is on the bed .
it was 15 pounds a day for in , room wired access or otherwise you had to buy a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* card for 6 pounds for 1 .
our room , and the hotel generally , was dated , looking a bit tired .
we ask for the room 10 minutes before check , in time and the room was n't ready .
we had a renovated room and it was really lovely and clean .
now my room was clean , comfortable and the equipment all worked as it should but if this was an executive room then i would hate to have stayed in a standard room .
our rooms were n't ready when we arrived , which was fine but they also were n't ready for hours after the official check , in time .
we also requested a room change , but for some reason this never worked out , but then again , we were n't in the room for much time as we were out sight , seeing .
mind you , hotel rooms in *UNKNOWN* are smaller than in the states , but this room was more than enough room for the two of us !
room was an executive club floor room and was larger than average for a *UNKNOWN* holiday *UNKNOWN* , well laid out and everything worked !
our room was on the 12th floor .
i had pre booked my room through the priority club , i 'm a platinum member and on checking in the reception told me their was only a twin room left .
the room was that bad , i did not even *UNKNOWN* .
complaining again to reception got me a double room , which they said at check in was not available .
the room was basic but cold , the heating system did not work at all .
our room was very comfortable , cosy and most importantly very clean .
rooms were cleaned every day without fail and *UNKNOWN* and coffee *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
rooms are clean and good size by *UNKNOWN* standards .
the room size is actually not bad , in fact , it is larger than the room i stayed at the holiday *UNKNOWN* regents park 6 months ago .
the major downside of my room is it faces *UNKNOWN* road and also an exposed section of the underground .
the room has a small *UNKNOWN* , which is a bit cold , but is in *UNKNOWN* need of *UNKNOWN* .
however , no in , room safe which is a bit disappointing .
bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .
however , i 'd be sure to request a room away from *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* due to the noise issue .
room , clean , good size , everything you need is in the room including the *UNKNOWN* , within every attractions , short walk or you can take the double *UNKNOWN* just across the street .
the bathroom door is a slide , door as there is no room for a normal hinged door .
that said , most *UNKNOWN* rooms are small and as we were only sleeping there , it was not really a problem .
there are no *UNKNOWN* facilities in standard rooms but there is an ill , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* room on floor 26 , you 'll need to ask for directions .
*UNKNOWN* , the rooms are a bit on the small side , and it 's a tad noisy generally of an evening , but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main *UNKNOWN* routes into *UNKNOWN* ?
bathroom looked new was clean .
nice clean rooms , good value , and average location near a tube station , but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all very noisy .
the room was immaculate , and perfect .
booked this room via *UNKNOWN* 's secret hotels and is described as an awesome *UNKNOWN* hotel .
our first room was adequate , simple and clean .
the room was clean , comfortable and quiet .
no problem said the receptionist i will fast track your room so it will be available at that time , and here is the key holder with the number of your room for when you return .
15 , after a lot of searching on the computer and a long wait , we were informed our family room was not ready would we take a seat and we would be called when it was available .
30 minutes later we were allocated a room , which was very small for three people , we then *UNKNOWN* that the bed for my grandson had not been made up , nor was there any extra bedding in the room .
there was insufficient room for suitcases , the *UNKNOWN* was somewhat tired and the room was not *UNKNOWN* .
we only had *UNKNOWN* in the hotel and were not impressed for it to be served in a room that was not really a restaurant .
no standard room was available 40 minutes before announced check , in right in time 30 minutes after .
the room itself was fine for our family of three when the pull out bed for my daughter was closed but a tight squeeze when open !
still , the room was comfortable enough and clean , although some of the fixtures and *UNKNOWN* were slightly worn , e .
for our purposes , the hotel was perfectly adequate , the location was good and the room was clean and quiet .
the rooms are quite small but the problem is they really could use some renovation .
the rooms were extremely small however and with the couch turned into a bed it was impossible to get from the bed to the bathroom .
arrived , did n't get the room we paid for or booked , apparently they are allowed to do this and its in the small print !
when i told them that my room is a smoking room i specified in my reservation that its non , smoking the employee asked me i wonder how could you specify that there was other incidents as well .
the bathroom was small , and water pressure was weak , but it was doable .
we arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in , and were delighted when we were offered a free upgrade to a *UNKNOWN* room , although this was a smoking room , there was n't too bad a smell , and we just opened the windows .
the room was a decent size for a *UNKNOWN* hotel room .
overall i could n't have been more satisfied and far from assigning me a humble room because i 'd booked a discounted *UNKNOWN* rate , i was given a room upgrade !
the next day , after coming back from *UNKNOWN* at around midnight , we went up to the room after seeing the queue of 8 persons waiting to see the receptionist and amazingly our keys worked and our bags were where we have left them .
upon arrival to the room itself , we discover that we have in fact been given a disabled , non smoking room .
i politely explained about my shock at being given a completely different room than what was booked !
the room itself was small , though clean and well appointed with a *UNKNOWN* bottle of wine and water .
basic necessities like iron , tea kettle , multiple *UNKNOWN* channels , safe deposit *UNKNOWN* , newspaper are always available in the room as standard equipment and there are no surprises .
the rooms toilets are of a certain size and you can settle in quickly , to start discovering the city you re visiting .
check , in was super , quick , the rooms was spot , on and breakfast was more than elaborate .
our room was clean , though small , the service was great , and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
the room was very small but clean , modern and comfortable .
the room itself was dated and the en , suite tiny , but it did have everything you needed for a comfortable stay .
the hotel room was very clean and *UNKNOWN* made up my daughter 's bed five minutes after phoning reception .
the room also has a *UNKNOWN* , which is not really a *UNKNOWN* , but a cooler , as described by staff .
the bathroom is a good size .
when we got to the hotel the front desk clerk told us that the double room we booked is not available because their reservation center had *UNKNOWN* the hotel .
in other words , if the room is already hot , you will not be able to cool it down unless you ask that the *UNKNOWN* be turned on , or unless you open a window .
the room was what we were expecting .
room was on 3rd floor but there was a private function in their function suite .
the room we booked was supposed to be an executive room .
the room we were given was small , poorly *UNKNOWN* it had the smallest bathroom we have ever had in an hotel and the traffic noise went on from about *UNKNOWN* :
my room was a typical *UNKNOWN* size i .
my room was non , smoking and did not smell like smoke .
my room was clean , although since i only stayed one night i can not comment about ongoing *UNKNOWN* .
overall , i would describe the room as free of serious problems , but drab and in need of *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* up .
my bathroom was , like the room , small .
by *UNKNOWN* standards , our room was large .
the room was clean and breakfast *UNKNOWN* .
when i checked in , i asked to be shown several rooms and the staff was happy to do so .
although smokers tend to get relegated to the worst rooms , i was happy with my 6th floor room .
we were upgraded to an executive room , which was fantastic , , double bed , lots of room , couch for extra seating .
the room also had an *UNKNOWN* outlet which was very useful .
we were very pleased with the room , and the staff was all very nice and helpful , including the *UNKNOWN* service .
however , if the room rates were the same and or i was using my priority club points i would choose the holiday *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* across the street .
the room was a nice size , very clean and more than adequate .
why some people *UNKNOWN* about the size of their room is beyond me .
yes the rooms are small , but realistically , how much time do you spend in the room ?
the room i was in was *UNKNOWN* , but the shower was terrible .
the rooms are not well shielded from noise and i had folks *UNKNOWN* away in the *UNKNOWN* practically all night .
*UNKNOWN* is placed in the room such that , if you try watching for a while , it is guaranteed that you will get stiff neck .
we booked direct on the hotel website and paid 75 pounds per room per night , which is extremely good for *UNKNOWN* and for the quality of the rooms .
we had arrived early and were prepared to wait for our room however we were offered an upgrade to an executive room because our allocated room was not yet ready .
the room was *UNKNOWN* and comfortable and came with a complementary bottle of wine , water and other *UNKNOWN* .
the only downside to the room is that is was very hot .
the room was clean and contemporary .
the room was actually pretty large compared to other hotel rooms i have seen in *UNKNOWN* .
as expected , the room was smaller than the usual *UNKNOWN* hotel , but clean quiet with fairly new furnishings .
the room 's refrigerator allowed us to cover several *UNKNOWN* snacks by shopping at the convenience grocery store that was also just a block away , so we skipped the hotel 's breakfast .
small rooms but mine was clean and a *UNKNOWN* bed .
i got a good deal on this stay , 2 nights for 123 pounds room only , through the priority club , as i was coming to stay to go to a concert celebrate my daughters 16th birthday .
reception , not too busy when i checked in , my room was ready .
the room was small , but there was a window that opened and good views over *UNKNOWN* although the windows could do with a good *UNKNOWN* !
the room was clean , and looked fine .
there is an empty *UNKNOWN* in the room , ours was n't working properly , so check if yours is before going down to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* for chilled items i did n't !
*UNKNOWN* access in the rooms is fine , but can slow down at peak times of the evening , the cost is also excessive .
i have to say that the room was a bit small but not uncomfortable .
*UNKNOWN* the room was ready for us so we could take a nap to get over the jet lag and head out for an afternoon evening of sight , seeing so we did n't lose any time due to the time difference .
the room was clean , neat and very well kept .
if you are a tourist who will only be in the room to sleep and shower this is the place for you .
service was friendly , our room was on the highest floor , but that was n't a problem because of the lifts , and we had a great view of the city from the room .
the room was average sized , but i 'm not paying to swing a cat in a hotel room .
instead of an executive room with a king bed and a wonderful breakfast each day at the *UNKNOWN* , this trip we paid more to stay at this holiday *UNKNOWN* and definitely had fewer and less posh amenities .
we knew the rooms were small , but ours was n't too small .
our room was always cleaned very well daily .
the room is just the smallest *UNKNOWN* thing you 'll ever see .
the room is generally *UNKNOWN* and the cleaning ladies do a great job of refilling all of the usual stuff .
the bathroom was generally *UNKNOWN* throughout .
however the corridors to our room had a pungent smell of deep heat , walls were covered in marks and the *UNKNOWN* appearance of public areas is dusty and old fashioned .
the room we booked was an executive .
the bathroom was looking tired *UNKNOWN* .
the second room was exactly the same .
room was still a small *UNKNOWN* style room .
the room was *UNKNOWN* clean and in good repair and also being a light sleeper i found it to be very quiet considering the hotel was so large .
all in all a great place to stay for a getaway break in *UNKNOWN* try and a room on a higher floor overlooking the city it is worth it !
the room was as expected for a holiday *UNKNOWN* , cute little *UNKNOWN* with lots of *UNKNOWN* , a *UNKNOWN* , comfortable beds , clean , neatly renovated bathroom , plenty of hot water , overall pleasant .
non , smoking room and floor was actually non , smoking !
*UNKNOWN* i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non , smoking rooms , not this time .
our room was very clean , although a bit small .
staff very friendly and i always worry when booking through *UNKNOWN* that i will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the *UNKNOWN* eye .
hotel was able to give us a two bed non , smoking room which is exactly what we wanted .
stayed here for business , first room was very small but after they changed my room it was fine .
i also got a phone call in the room on the second day from a strange man asking if i had found an ear ring which was lost that day in my room .
bathroom was comparable to an average north *UNKNOWN* hotel , which means fairly big for *UNKNOWN* .
my room was clean with tea and coffee making facilities , but there was wallpaper coming away from the walls and there was no cover on the bed , simply a *UNKNOWN* in a white sheet .
i originally asked for a room above the 10th floor looking over *UNKNOWN* but that side of the hotel was fully booked so got and upgrade to an executive room .
i was booked into the same room as the one i complained about last time and the *UNKNOWN* is still not fixed !
upon returning to the room after the false alarm , he was nowhere to be seen , so i connected the *UNKNOWN* up and put the trolley outside the room .
an *UNKNOWN* hotel if you get a room at a discounted rate .
the hotel itself is in need of an upgrade , its getting a bit tired , but saying that , the room was clean .
the room was on the small side , but had a great view of north *UNKNOWN* .
the bathroom was *UNKNOWN* , however there seemed to be a lack of water pressure , so the shower was a kin to standing under a tap .
the bathroom is bright and clean , with a modern tub and good water pressure .
as a priority club member i expected to have a decent room but this was not the case .
the room was extremely small .
room was small but adequate as i basically used the room to sleep in .
i appreciate that we had a large room so it 's difficult for me to comment on comfort of the standard room 's , however , the mentality we have is we 'd rather spend time exploring , so the size of the room is n't necessarily important .
the rooms were all modern although for an executive room all you basically get extra is a bottle of water , orange juice and robe .
our room was more than comfortable for two but when me made up the third bed the room was incredibly cramped , then again this is central *UNKNOWN* !
it was very hard to move around the room when the sofa bed was pulled out as another reviewer said you 'd have to crawl to move around .
the rooms that overlook the railway lines can be a little noisy , otherwise i have n't been disturbed by external noise .
the bathroom was modest in size and had a tub .
the *UNKNOWN* of the hotel and the rooms looks *UNKNOWN* not worth the money i was paying .
our room was clean , *UNKNOWN* and smart .
two people could n't walk within the room at the same time but i guess that is a problem with most hotels in *UNKNOWN* .
about the hotel , the first room given to us was having stained and patchy carpet and the *UNKNOWN* was also stained .
the second room 's phone did not work , *UNKNOWN* was again changed immediately after reporting .
the rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .
we stayed at the holiday *UNKNOWN* for about a week and the room was clean and quiet .
yes , the rooms are small but most hotel rooms are small in *UNKNOWN* so this was not a surprise .
the bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room in a lot of hotels that i looked at online in the same price range , bathrooms were not en suite .
despite its size , and the fact that there are over 20 floors of *UNKNOWN* , lift service was never slow , and the breakfast operation is exceptionally well , managed .
check in was prompt , and the room clean and *UNKNOWN* , a bit small , but this is central *UNKNOWN* .
the room is very small , which is fairly typical for *UNKNOWN* .
the room was small but not overly so .
the rooms are not huge but very clean and quiet , the view from our room was fabulous , and was very bright and cheerful .
room was n't luxurious but did exactly what we wanted in that it was clean and had a *UNKNOWN* bed !
room was clean and bathroom was compact and modern .
the room itself was very clean , the bathroom was small but immaculate .
the luggage facility was superb too , we had no problems in checking out of the room and leaving our luggage which was securely labeled and organised , for no extra cost .
we booked the room as a triple , and were pleasantly surprised to find three single beds , rather than a double and a sofa bed .
the room was generally clean .
the bathroom was adequate , and was cleaned each day .
the room was *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , great view as any other building with 20
instead of *UNKNOWN* bar my room had just the hole where it normally is placed and some hanging cables .
the room cost *UNKNOWN* per night and the room was very basic , small *UNKNOWN* , too soft mattress *UNKNOWN* .
plus , the bathroom is a good size .
the rooms are very clean and come with a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* that is empty and can be filled upon request .
the room was good and functional .

overall , we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in *UNKNOWN* then .
