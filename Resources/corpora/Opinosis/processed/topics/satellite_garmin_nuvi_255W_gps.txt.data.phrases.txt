it 's fast to acquire satellites .
the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* connects to satellites extremely fast , , so when i get in my car and turn it on , we 're pretty much ready to go immediately .
it picks up the satellites quickly , routes fast , has good animation maybe 6 , 8 frames a second ?
the revised chipset allows the *UNKNOWN* to make satellite connections quickly .
the unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals , tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected , *UNKNOWN* a new route very quickly .
*UNKNOWN* to lock on to satellite signals works well .
on i , 76 in *UNKNOWN* , i traveled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .
acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .
i would say that 90 % of the time it *UNKNOWN* a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less , the other 10 % is due to the above events .
and it is very fast locating satellites , the new interface needs some time to get used to , it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !
it is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface .
satellite lock , up and navigation precision was better for *UNKNOWN* , e .
i guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered i guess it loss contact with the satellites due to *UNKNOWN* by the tall buildings *UNKNOWN* .
by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100 % signal from the satellites and it 's ready to navigate , a beautiful crystal clear *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , and tons of other features .
satellite acquisition time is very fast , as is re , routing .
it also has a hot fix which finds satellites faster , which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for *UNKNOWN* routes very quickly .
satellite reception , , being in downtown *UNKNOWN* with skyscrapers surrounding me , the *UNKNOWN* maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage .
on a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a *UNKNOWN* , turn on the 6 lane highway !
if the hot fix satellite performance is supposed to be fast , i 'd hate to see the older versions without it .
i 'd be at my destination before they located the satellites .
it has no problems locating the satellites and does not get lost .
improved super fast satellite acquisition
i tested it again on a road trip and constantly lost satellite reception .
when i first turned the unit on , it had to search for satellites and pinpoint my location .
after turning the unit off and back on again , the *UNKNOWN* unit must search for satellites and re , locate me .
time to search for satellites :
the time that it takes to *UNKNOWN* the satellites is about 10 , 30 seconds .
it lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
the device *UNKNOWN* when satellite connection is lost but i never noticed any indication of when the connection came back .
when you turn on the unit , initial satellite connection takes about 3 minutes .
i really love the new interface , the turn signs at the corner , speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .
the *UNKNOWN* rate is fast and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .
it does n't take long to locate satellites , maybe 15 seconds or so .
good routing , easy to use , quick to lock on to satellites .
but unlike my previous *UNKNOWN* , the satellite acquisition is very fast , and *UNKNOWN* when i deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .
bottom line is i wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .
i was able to connect to a satellite within about five minutes of taking the unit out of the box .
i have noticed no problems with this unit 's ability to detect satellites .
it takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes , but i just set it up as soon as i get in the car and by the time i 'm out on the road and actually need directions it 's up and going .
when powered up initially it does a one , time search for satellites .
i took the unit outside to do that , and it found the satellites very quickly .
in the car , it locks onto the satellites extremely fast .
it is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend 's *UNKNOWN* 910 .
*UNKNOWN* always *UNKNOWN* satellite signal quickly
did n't even have time to really read up on the *UNKNOWN* so there may be features i do n't know about , but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .
many places in northern *UNKNOWN* and especially *UNKNOWN* lost contact with satellite *UNKNOWN* .
the satellite fix is very fast , about twice as fast as my old one .
large screen , text to speech street names , quick satellite fixes , and more , i think i made the best choice for my money .
so far , what i like the most is how fast it *UNKNOWN* the satellites .
picked up satellites very quickly .
even when my pickup is in the garage overnight with no power to the unit when i back out the next day it has the satellites instantly .
the *UNKNOWN* finds satellites faster than any other *UNKNOWN* on the market .
it includes the new hot fit technology and remembers the satellites positions when you turn the *UNKNOWN* off , so the next time you turn it on , it can relocate them very fast .
it also finds the satellite quickly .
i plugged this into my van 's lighter *UNKNOWN* turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .
the *UNKNOWN* time is excellent , so is the satellite signal connection .
took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite , but once that was done , it was a breeze .
also , as a novice user , i am really surprised at the time it takes for it to capture satellite signals , holding it up to the sky , outdoors .
my only complaints so far is that the *UNKNOWN* loses satellite reception often and *UNKNOWN* itself .
it 's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of *UNKNOWN* .
it grabs satellites quickly and *UNKNOWN* routes in seconds after i *UNKNOWN* off in the wrong direction .
