another thing to consider was that i paid $ 50 less for the 750 and it came with the *UNKNOWN* transmitter cable and a *UNKNOWN* cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .
update and *UNKNOWN* much _ more _ quickly than my other *UNKNOWN* .
update on this , it finally turned out that to see the elevation *UNKNOWN* at lower *UNKNOWN* levels you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .
it 's a *UNKNOWN* for most of us , traffic and content updates .
the text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the *UNKNOWN* put out for the *UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
, speed of map updates is awesome .
i first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $ 25 and they told me that i needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .
another big name site did the same thing and told me that i would have to pay *UNKNOWN* to update to the latest maps .
the navigation display shows more information , such as next turn street and speed limit , and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as i have seen in other models .
finally , be *UNKNOWN* around *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours *UNKNOWN* monuments and buildings , therefore taking you to dead ends .
this clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .
upon *UNKNOWN* my *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* in the *UNKNOWN* for the first time , it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .
the map update are free for the first 60 days after registering .
the map update was about *UNKNOWN* in size .
i have *UNKNOWN* cable internet and a quad , core *UNKNOWN* with *UNKNOWN* of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .
if you do n't have a fast internet connection the update will take some time .
i have held off from getting any *UNKNOWN* unit for a long time because i have a book of maps for the united states and i have always been able to update the travel atlas and supplement that with free maps from the internet via *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* update *UNKNOWN*
with the *UNKNOWN* , if you update to the newest map *UNKNOWN* you get everything the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* has minus the traffic .
and it is $ 79 a year to update the maps .
however , the points of interests are substandard , it would not pick up *UNKNOWN* that we know have been there *UNKNOWN* 3 *UNKNOWN* , and that was after we updated the maps , which was a 3 *UNKNOWN* download .
*UNKNOWN* with your savings , you can buy lifetime map updates from the *UNKNOWN* web site for $ 119 !
*UNKNOWN* links up flawlessly to my *UNKNOWN* using *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
i ran the *UNKNOWN* and there was an upgrade for the software and text for jack *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
today , i checked the web *UNKNOWN* again and their was a second update for jack *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
very disappointing that the product does not come with a standard power cable or even a *UNKNOWN* cable , especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .
then it said i needed to update some software i said *UNKNOWN* .
5 it came with the latest maps *UNKNOWN* city navigator *UNKNOWN* north *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and i did n't have to update it .
the maps seem to be fairly updated .
i found too many users who said that the traffic update feature is not all that *UNKNOWN* a feature .
i found the maps to be inaccurate at first , but after i updated them from *UNKNOWN* 's website everything is golden .
otherwise you ca n't update the maps !
also make sure you update the unit software from the *UNKNOWN* website on a regular basis .
use the *UNKNOWN* so that the unit is running at its peak .
i avoided the more complex ones as i had read that *UNKNOWN* updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .
it can be done by phone but if you do it that way you do n't get the one free update on the maps .
i updated to the latest 2010 map soon after i received the unit , so the map is accurate to me .
i also like the way that it connects to the internet to update all of its maps .
all i can really say about this , is update the firm ware straight out of the box , and when the *UNKNOWN* shows that it is acquiring signals do n't skip that .
i also like the fact that *UNKNOWN* makes the most recent map updates available rather than leave users hanging like some other *UNKNOWN* manufacturers .
once you have the unit , you 'll want to update the maps .
once receiving the unit , you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .
one guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the *UNKNOWN* map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .
directions and maps are easy to use , and if you miss a turn , it updates your route in seconds .
i discovered that i need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the *UNKNOWN* website .
more often than not , the estimated arrival time is updated 1 , 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .
map update , when you register it on , line you get an offer for one free map update .
i plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update , then probably never purchase an update .
by the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .
*UNKNOWN* also makes it easy to update your unit 's map annually .
i have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates , just wanted a navigator to guide me from point a to point b as i get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .
the only *UNKNOWN* disappointment was when i downloaded the free 2010 map update it dos n't show road extensions completed a few years ago .
getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .
easy to connect to *UNKNOWN* to download your free updated map .
, also very quick and i mean quick *UNKNOWN* when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving , not choppy on the screen .
, updating the *UNKNOWN* took way to long and i have *UNKNOWN* , 4 hours to download a *UNKNOWN* map update and 3 hours to install the program to the *UNKNOWN* .
i read that some *UNKNOWN* user could not get it to update at all .
, no traffic update but do n't really need it
we started with a non , touch screen which was great , then we updated to the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* which was a dream .
the sound is n't that bad , just make sure you get your free map update from the *UNKNOWN* site within the 60 day time period .
not so , tried the *UNKNOWN* web site for an updated map and was told by *UNKNOWN* that none was available .
loading a map update is another experience i wo n't go into .
have n't driven with it yet since the update but it seems crisp and with more detail .
glad i updated the map and software .
since the update , drove it locally in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and it worked *UNKNOWN* .
in a test the day i received the unit , before map updates , i was directed to exit the freeway many miles before it made sense .
