not customer , oriented *UNKNOWN* low service *UNKNOWN* reception
the room was quiet , clean , the bed and *UNKNOWN* were comfortable , and the service was adequate .
there were no service issues to speak of , but it 's not an overly , friendly hotel .
good location horrible service disgusting procedures .
if you 're looking for a full , service experience , this is still not the hotel for you .
the holiday *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* forum is fine if you like large , impersonal hotels with mediocre service , overcrowded breakfast rooms and do n't mind tired *UNKNOWN* .
we found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent .
great stay friendly service great location .
a prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service , so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost .
in *UNKNOWN* its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place , the holiday *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* forum did that for me and i could n't ask for more .
breakfast was good , with many choices and excellent service .
service in all areas , at all levels was good .
it 's rated 4 , stars , but i also stayed at an *UNKNOWN* rated *UNKNOWN* while in *UNKNOWN* , and a 3 , star holiday *UNKNOWN* express in *UNKNOWN* , and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .
maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .
at the reception the service were *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* during that five minutes i was standing there , the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* three times !
good location new room bad service .
the only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .
i am recommending the forum despite the service problems .
poor *UNKNOWN* friendly assistance .
it is not 4 star hotel service .
convenient location not 4 , star room and services but *UNKNOWN* .
room and service , our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
service impersonal but friendly .
did not use any of the hotels other services , but i was pleased overall and would stay here again .
they also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food , great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
we arrived at 11 am , but were able to check in with the professional and service , minded staff right away .
someone needs to help those folks with a *UNKNOWN* course in customer service .
near a tube station that services three subway lines , for starters .
we are low maintenance so we did n't have to request service much , but when we did it was fine .
not too happy with the service from *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* .
i ordered room service one night , and the food was delightful , and the service was fast and friendly .
if you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a *UNKNOWN* who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then do n't stay here .
however the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result , the service we received was variable , with little recognition of our platinum priority club rewards status , and slow room service .
for a little extra money , the soon to be *UNKNOWN* plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location
only *UNKNOWN* is their breakfast service .
convenient location great *UNKNOWN* service .
i would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .
talking about food , something worth noticing is that there was a *UNKNOWN* in the room , but it was completely reserved for the *UNKNOWN* , bar service beverages , which completely filled it .
the service was the worst service we have ever recieved in my life the worst .
*UNKNOWN* , service finished at *UNKNOWN* , there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was *UNKNOWN* , the ingredients seemed poor quality .
room service is expensive but good , the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired holiday *UNKNOWN* room service menu , when i ordered a 6 .
, but after i called room service it was promptly fixed .
there are no bottle openers or *UNKNOWN* screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .
there is also a laundry service at the hotel , but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account i would n't plan on using it .
reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .
but there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
the room and bathroom were very clean and *UNKNOWN* each day to a high standard .
the main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .
if you 're looking for a comfortable , clean hotel with a mid , range level of service and easy access , then this hotel would serve you well .
we ate on evening once at the *UNKNOWN* pub in the mall , it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
did not use any other facilities or order room service .
there was an adequate self service buffet , not a huge selection or very well presented , cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
exceptionally poor , and surprising , service .
great location service questionable .
our room was clean , though small , the service was great , and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
i liked this hotel , nice big room and very good customer service .
front , line staff members speak very poor *UNKNOWN* , and provide very poor customer service .
poor customer service , bad and *UNKNOWN* pub food .
room service took 15 minutes , which shocked me .
we were very pleased with the room , and the staff was all very nice and helpful , including the *UNKNOWN* service .
if you hang around in the lobby , you can hear other people complaining about poor service , poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff .
but be prepared for some poor service quality .
service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times , but on average i had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .
the food was excellent , the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
the food is excellent and the service great .
service was friendly , our room was on the highest floor , but that was n't a problem because of the lifts , and we had a great view of the city from the room .
but after having spent an entire week in *UNKNOWN* , i came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .
service was *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* hotel , wide .
the breakfast is self service on the first floor , not cheap but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .
the card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .
the service is pleasant enough , and i was given a room with a nice view of central *UNKNOWN* on the 14th floor without having to ask , despite booking on *UNKNOWN* .
this is suppose to be a full service *UNKNOWN* , but i would only *UNKNOWN* it at best as a motel 6 quality .
service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although i 've always found the staff to be pleasant , not all of them fully understand *UNKNOWN* .
on the first night of my stay , i tried to use room service .
on the third night i tried room service again .
room service *UNKNOWN* called me up after about *UNKNOWN* asking if i really needed the stuff that i had ordered .
the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .
is this the level of customer service you want ?
on my last day i used the *UNKNOWN* service to arrange a cab for me .
if you use wake up call service .
i think that is bad service .
there is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and *UNKNOWN* only every half hour .
great location indifferent service .
i would stay here again because in *UNKNOWN* it really is a value for the service and quality of room .
despite its size , and the fact that there are over 20 floors of *UNKNOWN* , lift service was never slow , and the breakfast operation is exceptionally well , managed .
the maid service was good and everything was cleaned and *UNKNOWN* .
we ate at a really good indian , very popular , good service plenty to eat for about 7 each .
basic clean lodging service lacking .
the internet service which costs *UNKNOWN* per day is slower than dial , up !
good room poor service all round .
but those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel .
the rude and poor service started from the *UNKNOWN* who was *UNKNOWN* when i asked a question .
the service at the breakfast room was *UNKNOWN* .
the only down side was the same as last time , very impersonal service by the management and the on , duty manager was just pure rude , but if you do n't have to talk to any staff members , this hotel is great .
stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator fan noise .
we passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency *UNKNOWN* which should give better rates than the hotels in , house money changing service .
there is 24 hour room service , a restaurant , and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .
in all , as with many holiday *UNKNOWN* hotels worldwide , affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .
the *UNKNOWN* was self , service and barely functional , so did n't chill the sodas i bought .
the immediate area around the hotel is extremely well *UNKNOWN* by at least 3 internet cafes , grocery store next to tube station , as well as several nice cafes and restaurants .
ask is a very nice *UNKNOWN* restaurant nearby serving *UNKNOWN* and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10
if you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service , look elsewhere .
although we did get a strange phone call from room service at *UNKNOWN* , wrong number i think .
well , located and good service .
in spite of its size , we found the service to be good , speedy check , in , and very rapid response to a broken toilet at *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* with boots pharmacy , whole foods type ritzy *UNKNOWN* market , coffee shops , *UNKNOWN* .
the hotel offers a laundry service which i needed to take advantage of .
however the service was quite efficient my pants were brought back the same day .
it was clean and *UNKNOWN* promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .
*UNKNOWN* and their *UNKNOWN* top secret hotels ' service .
service was great and the *UNKNOWN* was very helpful .
excellent location shame about the service !
also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of *UNKNOWN* bar !
the maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .
we took a private car service from airport to hotel , and it cost 55 pounds .
my *UNKNOWN* and i average about $ 70 a dinner regardless of *UNKNOWN* we ate out or did room service , , *UNKNOWN* .
service is not particularly attentive , but not rude .
stunning food , amazing service .
great service and perfect location !
for the price , cleanliness , service and quality it *UNKNOWN* deserves a higher star rating .
i wish that the hotel had better service , however .
to get ice , you have to first get a bucket from room service .
to get room service , it called *UNKNOWN* .
for a similarly good location , you can stay at the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* for the same price and receive much better service .
quite *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* service at reception , from two separate people .
staff were mostly ethnic origin , presenting a couple of communication problems at check in room service was slow and fairly bland and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises , again unusual for such a high profile company .
i stayed in room 354 , on the *UNKNOWN* floor , no *UNKNOWN* , no newspaper delivery , room service *UNKNOWN* standing outside room for almost 24 hours un *UNKNOWN* poor service in *UNKNOWN* .
we had room service the night we arrived , and it was good quality , and arrived quickly .
super dinner and attentive service .
food was *UNKNOWN* , service very *UNKNOWN* .
we had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant , well cooked again , but the service was very slow .
the included *UNKNOWN* was a plus and i noticed the *UNKNOWN* folks using the free service in the lobby .
i noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .
we were on the 20th floor very happy with the rooms the service .
i can say that every time i have been disappointed with either the value , standards , cleanliness , service of the hotel .
the food was good and the service was very good .
excellent location and service .
*UNKNOWN* was very helpful we didnt take the *UNKNOWN* breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and *UNKNOWN* coffee and the service was very nice .
service was efficient but far from personal , how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !
it met all my expectations , very clean room *UNKNOWN* pleasing modern *UNKNOWN* , above average *UNKNOWN* services , accomodating staff .
room service will bring a bucket of ice any time , or there s a machine on the 25th floor .
typical *UNKNOWN* impersonal service from staff .
excellent location service cleanliness and price at the holiday *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* forum .
all in all great location , nice restaurants nearby , nicely pitched service .
what brings down my rating for the hotel is their service .
i still ca n't figure out if it 's a difference in service from us and *UNKNOWN* standards or if it 's just this hotel .
good *UNKNOWN* service , recommended very good restaurants , *UNKNOWN* and indian , to us , in walking distance from the hotel .
the hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service .
we used room service one night and it was excellent .
food quality was good , service prompt , everything prepared as we had ordered .
the service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you .
the price is moderate for the service and the location .
the price , the space , the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .
this hotel is located in an excellent area of *UNKNOWN* and is just around the corner from *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites .
fantastic , professional , helpful staff , clean rooms , great room service , fitness area and internet business facilities keep me coming back .
great location , freshly renovated , very small rooms , anonymous hotel , acceptable service .
my family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this *UNKNOWN* and had outstanding customer service .
, we booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the *UNKNOWN* expected in a 5 , star hotel !
we also love the service of the staff , not to *UNKNOWN* the kindly people which store our bags .
i was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .
service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient .
be cautious of using the room services like the phone , *UNKNOWN* bar and room service as the prices are sky high , but i would definitely stay there again and i would recommend this hotel to anyone !
