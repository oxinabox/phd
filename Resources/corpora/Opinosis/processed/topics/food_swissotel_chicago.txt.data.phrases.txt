the food for our event was delicious .
the food in the lounge was great and very fresh , , , *UNKNOWN* , sandwiches *UNKNOWN* .
as far as food , walk a few blocks toward *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* turn left or right and there are *UNKNOWN* of less expensive places to eat .
the palm *UNKNOWN* in the hotel had some specials *UNKNOWN* night , we ate there and the food service , *UNKNOWN* were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big *UNKNOWN* .
took the charge of the *UNKNOWN* which we had used to keep my 2 year old sons food .
we never ate anything *UNKNOWN* so i ca n't *UNKNOWN* for the food options immediately *UNKNOWN* .
the lobby bar does not serve food very late at night and we could n't find any vending machines for soda or snacks , so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .
in any case , i had allotted approximately $ 150 for food for 4 days 3 nights .
the food was delicious and the view was fabulous .
for self catering types , *UNKNOWN* is a well stocked *UNKNOWN* grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks , drinks and all kinds of *UNKNOWN* prepared foods , plus the *UNKNOWN* center 's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .
room service was *UNKNOWN* though , very very expensive , so we didnt bother , as food outlets a few minutes walk away .
we also did the *UNKNOWN* food *UNKNOWN* tour which you can find here on *UNKNOWN* , this was fantastic and well worth the $ 40 *UNKNOWN* .
so if you move around bottles in the *UNKNOWN* so that you can store your own food personal items , the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .
we passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .
also do n't forget to go the & *UNKNOWN* the river north & *UNKNOWN* for great food .
an added bonus was the executive lounge with *UNKNOWN* food throughout the day .
room service food quality was very good but with a $ 7 tray charge plus 20 % service , i then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .
there is a market one block south of the *UNKNOWN* that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until *UNKNOWN* , and a *UNKNOWN* 's grocery store across the river open *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
had an appetizer at the lobby lounge , and the food came from the palm restaurant .
the hotel buffet had fabulous food .
i did n't dine in the hotel , so i ca n't tell you about the food .
we enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .
room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when i ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .
i was delighted as the waiters were very friendly and the seafood was delicious .
mile with traditional *UNKNOWN* food and a great atmosphere .
a nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
good but *UNKNOWN* food , great breakfast .
my only complaint is the palm restaurant , it is expensive and the food not very good .
if you want good food at a decent price , there is a restaurant called *UNKNOWN* 's down the street from the hotel on *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
we ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is fun , , *UNKNOWN* servers , diner food , total check about $ 30 for all four of us .
brain food cafe in the museum of science and industry , , sounds crazy i know but it was the best museum food ever .
no line , a plate full of real food with drink included for $ 7 each .
staying with food , try also the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , n .
the few complaints i had were as follows , refrigerator was stocked with food that was weight sensitive .
but the food was good and fresh .
very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price .
we called several times and within 30 minutes our food was at the door .
the *UNKNOWN* food was superb .
my wife and i are food *UNKNOWN* , and this place really was a treat .
very much enjoyed the *UNKNOWN* food tour , a walking tour that incorporates food *UNKNOWN* at various places like a bakery , traditional *UNKNOWN* , pizza , chocolate lounge , *UNKNOWN* .
room service was efficient , average priced , and decent food .
i ate their last night and the food and service were top *UNKNOWN* .
i had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby , to the quality of the room , to the view , to the room service , to the food .
the hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants , but that was not the case either , , other than room service the only option for dinner is the palms restaurant which is very *UNKNOWN* for the quality of the food .
there 's an escalator that goes into the basement where you 'll find a nice upscale restaurant and a long walkway concourse that leads to an underground *UNKNOWN* , mall , with a grocery store , fast , food restaurants , barber shop *UNKNOWN* .
food *UNKNOWN* although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant was of good quality .
we were able to get a crib , a play pen , and a small room refrigerator for storing baby food at no additional cost .
the food at the *UNKNOWN* is better than the average hotel but nothing special .
