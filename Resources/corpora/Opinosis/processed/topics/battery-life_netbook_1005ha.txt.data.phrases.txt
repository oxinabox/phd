not to mention that as of now *UNKNOWN* will not sell you a spare 3 or 6 , cell *UNKNOWN* , ion battery .
it also features a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , 6 , cell *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , ion battery 8 .

of battery life if you 're using *UNKNOWN* & doing email word processing *UNKNOWN* web surfing .
the *UNKNOWN* super hybrid engine utility lets users *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* their *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* 's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
a few other things i 'd like to point out is that you must push the *UNKNOWN* , sized right angle end of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .
in addition the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* does get quite hot while it is actively charging the battery , which *UNKNOWN* clearly mentions in the user manual , so one should not be alarmed over the heat output .

after you add sales tax , you are then approaching the price of the *UNKNOWN* series which gets twice the battery life .
battery life is one of the biggest features of a *UNKNOWN* so i would n't go cheap and get less battery .
deciding between the *UNKNOWN* series and the *UNKNOWN* series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different , a small battery life difference , a better web cam , *UNKNOWN* , and or the *UNKNOWN* sleeve .
, the best thing about this unit is the battery life .
, the long life battery makes this unit heavy .
since the battery life difference is minimum , the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .
for $ 30 , $ 40 more you get one less *UNKNOWN* port , you get covered *UNKNOWN* ports which is annoying , and you get less than half the battery life .
it has the longest battery life of any notebook .
while my *UNKNOWN* works like a charm , i personally know several folks that have experienced issues with the battery and or power supply .
eventually , i noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .
they did n't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some did n't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .
some *UNKNOWN* faulted the battery life , but did n't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer .
the battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .
i suppose that is one reason why i kept *UNKNOWN* to the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* as i explored the reviews for other brands , , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery *UNKNOWN* and inoperative batteries i bought the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
the main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
i wanted the *UNKNOWN* to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .
the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is sleek and that big battery does n't stick out on the back edge like the other *UNKNOWN* high capacity batteries do .
i like it a lot the battery and *UNKNOWN* problems i feared so much have not materialized .
i am still a little worried about that battery thing .
i may have left you with some question about the battery and charging system , , i am sorry about that .
after almost two months of using my new *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* i can report no problem with the battery , bringing the battery to a full charge or the charging brick itself .
my *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* works great with *UNKNOWN* , i 've gotten 6 hours on my battery watching movies , listening to music before *UNKNOWN* it back in .
two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life , and the led *UNKNOWN* for the screen .
the *UNKNOWN* is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life , but it also makes for a very nice bright picture .
for the average user the battery charge life will be a *UNKNOWN* surprise .
faster overall performance , and shorter charge life on the battery .
when i recently started looking into purchasing a *UNKNOWN* , i was impressed with the battery life of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
when i found out about the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* coming out , i ordered one with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive .
to make a long story short , the track pad buttons are a nightmare and the battery *UNKNOWN* on the bottom is an ugly compromise .
add the high running temperature to the poorer than expected battery life , and the *UNKNOWN* went back .
the *UNKNOWN* was not a consideration because of the non , removable battery and significantly shorter battery life .
i have not experienced the problems with the battery *UNKNOWN* mentioned by other reviewers either .
the light weight , the battery life , the keyboard , the non , *UNKNOWN* removable battery , the bright screen , the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .
battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true *UNKNOWN* with its full size keys .
the battery life on this thing really is
, very sharp , clear image , even with *UNKNOWN* turned down low to get the most from the battery
0 out of 5 stars i wish i had listened to everyone with charging *UNKNOWN* battery issues !
the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* just stopped charging the battery .
i bought this back in early *UNKNOWN* and have had no problems with my battery or *UNKNOWN* .
i have n't drained the battery yet , and i 've been coast to coast with it , waits , *UNKNOWN* .
it is a big battery , and it does tend to tip backwards if fully opened and placed on a flat surface .
*UNKNOWN* narrowed it down , battery life narrowed it further , ability to *UNKNOWN* the memory was a further *UNKNOWN* , and when i was done it was this model or an *UNKNOWN* wind .
after receiving it in the mail , i plugged it into the outlet in the living room and allowed the battery to charge .
recently , however , my battery was about to die , and i had already set up shop in another room of my house , so i decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while i worked on it .
the battery life is quite extensive .
if money is your leading consideration , then one of these may be for you , but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen , better battery life , bigger drive , more *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
it has a solid feel to it , but the battery *UNKNOWN* out quite a bit , the *UNKNOWN* keys are terribly placed , the *UNKNOWN* is only 0 .
since then , i 've used it exclusively on battery power .
has an 11 screen with the same or better battery life , .
however , the second time my daughter tried to charge the computer using the supplied battery *UNKNOWN* .
the *UNKNOWN* would not operate at all and the computer became useless once the onboard battery ran down .
with some *UNKNOWN* , the battery indeed lasted over 10 hours , even while watching hours of .
four hours of solid on running through a *UNKNOWN* on the battery and still showed 4 hours left on the battery .
5 hour battery is the real deal , i had my unit on for 10 hours and it was still running with just over 10 % battery capacity remaining .
the battery power is as advertised which is a main reason i selected this *UNKNOWN* .
the battery does not *UNKNOWN* and is *UNKNOWN* .
i think i will love this machine for the purposes i bought it , *UNKNOWN* , battery life to carry me through travels and for my teenager to use .
5 battery life was just a claim , but charged at % 100 my battery life clocked in 10 .
the battery life on this thing is truly incredible .
the first day i got it i used it for at least 7 hours and windows still said it had an hour and a half battery life left before i decided to charge it .
all in all , great product , great battery life .
this thing has great battery life , fits in the glove box of my car , and serves the uses of a *UNKNOWN* in excellent fashion .
my only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use , but there are pocket , able battery powered speaker options , i am using the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* orbit *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* im , 237 orbit *UNKNOWN* speaker for *UNKNOWN* players , which is great .
*UNKNOWN* this thing has a great battery life our i 'd be out of luck .
but the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .
i expected six or seven hours in reality , , i 'm aware that battery life claims , like *UNKNOWN* with cars , are usually puffed up .
if your primary needs are *UNKNOWN* and epic battery life , so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you 're on the go , and you want good construction then this is the machine for you .
while this is still a fine machine , battery life has started dropping off already .
my 10 , hour battery is now a 7 .
the battery arrived pre , charged .
when putting the battery on , it nearly doubles the weight of the computer .
i have been able to make the battery expectancy get up the reported 10 .
0 out of 5 stars would have been 5 stars except for failed battery and failed *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
4 pass , battery life is amazing , used the laptop in super performance mode for over 6 hours of watching videos , checking email , connecting with *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* broadband card , and still had battery life *UNKNOWN* .
1 fail , after one charge cycle , the battery blew a circuit , and would no longer power the *UNKNOWN* .
2 fail , after three charge cycles , the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* blew a circuit , and would no longer charge the battery .
the battery life was the huge selling point for me and it is truly awesome .
seriously , i felt extravagant and almost guilty when he noted the 10 hour battery life on my *UNKNOWN* .
of course , without the *UNKNOWN* you ca n't charge the battery or operate the computer .
the battery life is so good , it was not an issue !
i have had the laptop for 3 weeks now and i have had no trouble with the battery life or the charging process .
*UNKNOWN* , but it 's unstable , and i have actually returned it to stock speeds since the battery life is much better at stock .
the battery life is as advertised here .
battery life is the longest of any system i 've ever had or seen .
as for the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* out i 've had no such problem as when plugged in it 's always on and when on battery it lasts a long time .
wo n't send battery without fax letter of agreement .
if we do n't get fax no battery .
when might the battery arrive .
battery is width of 10 *UNKNOWN* .
will update when battery arrives in a few weeks .
pro 's , i so wanted to love the small size , long battery life , brilliant blue color and light weight .
the battery life is as advertised .
battery life depends on how it 's being used but it 's much better than it 's little brother the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* 900 .
well i first ordered this *UNKNOWN* through *UNKNOWN* music for a good price and when it arrived i charged the battery fully and later turned it on .
a few hours later the battery light is on and green .
battery life seems to be good .

5 hour battery pack and the 2 *UNKNOWN* crucial upgrade from *UNKNOWN* after continued delays from *UNKNOWN* on my new *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* notebook with *UNKNOWN* .
5 hour battery claim , but it seems to be accurate .
i needed something comfortable for typing documents plus something with long battery life to keep in my briefcase .
i picked it up right away due to the battery life , keyboard and sleek design .
i actually went without charging it for more than a day because the battery life is just so amazing .
with such a great battery life , keyboard and responsive touch pad , there 's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .
my battery *UNKNOWN* failed within 24 hours , i returned it and received no notification that a replacement was shipped .
3 *UNKNOWN* camera , the *UNKNOWN* atom processor , a 6 , cell battery , and much more .
i bought this about 3 weeks ago , and just until now , the *UNKNOWN* wont completely charge the battery .
the warranty card *UNKNOWN* states that the warranty covers everything but , the battery or free accessories such as mice or laptop bag .
the battery is spectacular , and the key board did n't take any time getting used to , and of course it is a very cute cool little *UNKNOWN* .
i had a 2 year old *UNKNOWN* that just gave me problems so often , and recently the *UNKNOWN* went out , *UNKNOWN* the battery 's connection malfunctioned so it had to stay plugged in and the internet could not be detected , while my parents laptops were fine .
*UNKNOWN* has longer battery life and $ 30 cheaper , plus people complained about the port covers getting annoying in the *UNKNOWN* .
and you can upgrade the ram and remove the battery to be replaced in a few years , or buy another battery to carry around .
the *UNKNOWN* you would have to ship into the *UNKNOWN* company to get a new battery upgrade for ram , which will cost something .
great battery life , very fast on my wireless router , does websites with flash and other media supported elements and even though i still love my *UNKNOWN* i needed something with a bit more *UNKNOWN* to store vacation *UNKNOWN* in on the road and attach files to email .
sure this one has a larger battery .
the keyboard is easy to type on , the battery life is great , and i 've found that i really do like the touch pad with all its features .
my computer exhibited the precise symptoms described by others , , the first charge , up went fine , but when i had depleted the battery and went to *UNKNOWN* it , the power supply failed to do anything .
, around the house , i can freely roam to wherever i find comfortable or least noisy , never having to worry about the power cord because of the seemingly *UNKNOWN* battery life .
this thing shines , yet barely *UNKNOWN* at the battery
full sized laptops are so *UNKNOWN* bulky , heavy , and the battery *UNKNOWN* even make it though one of my evening classes .
the reason i went with *UNKNOWN* is the long battery life without the huge bump in the back , a fast *UNKNOWN* , easy memory upgrade , good looks and great price .
i bought this to use when traveling within a developing country , where i need lots of battery life and do n't feel like *UNKNOWN* around my conspicuous 15 notebook .
good battery life under *UNKNOWN* about 7 .
it 's bigger , heavier , and has less battery life , but it is much easier to upgrade internal components .
its battery life is much longer , though not quite the stated 10 .
the 6 , cell *UNKNOWN* , ion battery is seamless integrated into the mainframe to minimize space usage .
the battery life is amazing .
with the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .
the battery life has not been tested in one complete sitting .
however , as would be expected , if i *UNKNOWN* my cellphone for internet use , it does drain the battery very quickly .
the use of *UNKNOWN* also seems to drain the battery , but just not as quickly .
as far as i can tell , i do not think the battery will last more than six hours for my use .
i suppose if i turned off the *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* and did nothing more than use *UNKNOWN* word , the battery would last longer .
i also noted the *UNKNOWN* becomes extremely hot when plugged in and charging the computer battery .
long battery life , sharp looking machine , fingerprint magnet , glossy screen *UNKNOWN* glare , ease of use and *UNKNOWN* .
charges fully and swiftly , long lasting battery time , functions beautifully .
5 hour battery life , *UNKNOWN* 7 , *UNKNOWN*
and the battery last only about 7 hours of normal use .
battery life is over 8 hours and i plan to upgrade the memory soon .
the battery life is excellent , with normal usage i can get about 7 hours easily , more if i turn off *UNKNOWN* and turn down the screen *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* battery life , *UNKNOWN* it runs windows *UNKNOWN* not *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* !
i do imagine playing games on it would reduce the amount of time on the battery .
also , if you 're on the web a lot it does take up a little more battery but not enough that you ca n't still use it most of the day on one charge .
it 's incredibly light even with the battery pack in .
the best part of the *UNKNOWN* is that the battery is user , *UNKNOWN* .
i was originally going to buy an *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* but heard the batteries were not user , *UNKNOWN* , thus you had to send the computer back to *UNKNOWN* for them to replace the battery with a turn , around time of up to a few months !
the laptop itself is great , nice crisp display , great battery life , light , and a nice form factor .
i 've run the machine on battery power some four or five times so far and have found no problems with charge or battery power life .
i spend a lot of time in battery , power environments for other technical devices , so i 'm a bit more *UNKNOWN* when it comes to expected battery life versus real battery life .
0 out of 5 stars *UNKNOWN* with power and battery life , *UNKNOWN* 24 , *UNKNOWN*
the *UNKNOWN* allows for a big battery .
i say it 's a small price to pay for a sleek and light computer with an incredible battery life .
after an initial full charging , i ran this *UNKNOWN* to 1 % battery life before the first three times i recharged it .
the *UNKNOWN* that charges the battery *UNKNOWN* really easily .
0 out of 5 stars a great little machine , perfect for travels , though battery life bit shorter than advertised .
i was looking for *UNKNOWN* , light weight , and long battery life , which removed a great many manufacturers off my list .
when i read the *UNKNOWN* and the reviews and the extra hour of battery life for just a few *UNKNOWN* more , my decision was revised .
i 've had the machine for 2 weeks now and the only thing that i 'm not very happy with is that the battery power , for me anyway , does n't last 10 .
5 hours from the battery i usually get 7 .
i 'm just glad that i did n't buy a machine with slightly less hours of battery life .
if someone is in the market for a great little traveling machine to access the internet , send receive *UNKNOWN* , do some writing , and need extended battery life , i highly recommend this *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
there are other machines out there , some with identical *UNKNOWN* , some similiar , but none match the battery life .
terrific value at $ 324 , , especially considering the six cell battery !
some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the *UNKNOWN* .
again , the long , lasting battery makes it worth it .
then i switched to battery power and the machine froze .
when i put back the factory memory the machine worked perfectly on a c and battery .
our unit has operated flawlessly so far and the 10 hour battery is a real plus .
the trick is to fully charge and then fully discharge this battery several times before you start using it in the regular mode .
great battery life , decent sized screen , and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
i originally bought the *UNKNOWN* to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere , but have started exclusively using the *UNKNOWN* in place of my laptop because of its *UNKNOWN* and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .
the only minor issue is that the battery life is a bit less after the windows 7 upgrade .
what none of the reviews i read told me is that the *UNKNOWN* company recommends that when you are somewhere that has electricity , you should take out the battery and just plug in the machine .
they said there are only so many *UNKNOWN* in the life of any battery , and when you do n't have to use the battery , it extends its life .
one of the reasons i chose this *UNKNOWN* was that the battery does come out , my old laptop had an internal battery , and when it stopped taking a charge , i had to replace the whole machine .
so i decided that whatever i buy has to have a removable battery .
the battery life has been very good , especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and *UNKNOWN* , and turning down the screen *UNKNOWN* .
this is n't a *UNKNOWN* , and usually when you want extended battery life , you 're on a plane where you do n't need full *UNKNOWN* or radio anyway .
such much lighter and smaller , and compared to the *UNKNOWN* , its battery is *UNKNOWN* .
the battery life is also great , i can charge my phone out of the *UNKNOWN* port in class and not have to worry about running low on battery before the day is over .
the battery life is plenty for me .
i have n't done a real battery test , but i can tell you that it 's on all day at work and i do n't even bring the power cord from home .
and i love the battery , life i 'm not sure it was 10 .
in terms of battery life its not really 10 .
i 'm glad i did , i charged the battery before attempting anything .
i mention the battery life which i usually get about 8 hours with full *UNKNOWN* , playing videos or music , and have multiple programs running simultaneously .
i needed a computer easy to move , to work efficiently and with long battery life and that was precisely what i got .
this did not affect me much , i can write without problems full university texts , media files run without any problem and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in high performance mode without depleted .
the advantages over *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* are in the best battery and the magnificent *UNKNOWN* that comes with the computer .
another , i needed one that had a long battery life , since it would be a bother to have to charge a *UNKNOWN* every 4 , 5 hours .
decent speed processor , nice screen quality , great *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , and very long battery life .
for those wanting to install win 7 , it works great , no glitches or *UNKNOWN* , startup is fast , and less battery loss than *UNKNOWN* .
space bar changes battery settings on the *UNKNOWN* software .
i like *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* 's battery life .
keeps it nice and cool and does n't have a significant effect on the battery .
the battery life is incredible .
for another $ 50 , you get a 6 cell battery with 8 hours of run time .
5 hours of battery life , *UNKNOWN* , a better *UNKNOWN* can someone confirm this ?
i am a college student that got tired of *UNKNOWN* around a heavy *UNKNOWN* laptop with less than 3 hours battery life .
the battery life is unbelievable , even while using *UNKNOWN* to transfer files , watching movies and surfing the internet with screen *UNKNOWN* all the way up .
i did n't time it but i got tired of waiting to run down the battery .
i look forward to having something much lighter and not worrying about when the battery will die .
0 out of 5 stars no issues at all , battery *UNKNOWN* works fine .
my *UNKNOWN* battery has never had any problems .
i carry this *UNKNOWN* in my purse at all times , the long battery lasts as long as described .
the small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop , the long battery life is really great , and the speed and performance using various *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* connections was better than i expected it to be .
i always dreamed of a *UNKNOWN* that has very long battery life
has three *UNKNOWN* ports on the sides and the back area houses the six cell battery .
factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen *UNKNOWN* set to 50 % but can easily be adjusted to the necessary *UNKNOWN* illumination you may need .
regarding battery duration i can not comment on its purpose since whenever i am doing word processing tasks , have always music or videos running .
and using the two *UNKNOWN* port external *UNKNOWN* disk drive , battery life decreases to only two hours .
it 's battery life and ease of replacement is key .
i have the $ 299 version from best buy , it has a 3 cell battery with *UNKNOWN* of battery operation .
a 6 cell battery costs over $ 79 dollars .
i was skeptical about the long battery life and the cool , touch but i got about 9 .
*UNKNOWN* battery model is going to run a touch heavier than the 6 .
*UNKNOWN* battery models but the extra battery life is really worth it .
it does not overheat and the battery lasts a long time , not 10 .
using a *UNKNOWN* mouse *UNKNOWN* the battery time but i love it anyway , it fits into my purse , the colors are great and it is much quicker than my desk top .
the computer will rarely turn on even though the battery has plenty of charge in it .
the battery life is to die for , my full size laptop doesnt have 10
i 'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this *UNKNOWN* but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .
real world battery life is less than the 10 .
i usually get 8 , 930 *UNKNOWN* of battery while browsing the internet and using office .
within a few hours of owning this *UNKNOWN* the battery meter stopped working .
the battery life will ensure that i can go hours without needing a *UNKNOWN* .
first is the incredible battery life .
i have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what *UNKNOWN* seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running *UNKNOWN* and other applications with around half screen *UNKNOWN* .
has a very long battery life , runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues , fast loading , very *UNKNOWN* keyboard , stylish sleek design , decent pricing for what you get
the *UNKNOWN* 10 hour battery life is great .
since i have *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* on most of the time i actually get about 6 *UNKNOWN* 7 hours of battery life .
the battery power is long lasting , and it serves me well throughout the day .
1 light weight , 2 long battery life , and 3 reasonable performance .
although *UNKNOWN* is lighter and thinner , i felt that *UNKNOWN* is a better choice for me because of its removable , long battery life and easy ram access .
when you start it up for the first time , leave it plugged in only as long as it takes for the battery to charge to full .
at this point , it is normal for the *UNKNOWN* to become very , very hot while charging all the way from low battery .
if you follow these instructions for several battery cycles , you should find that the *UNKNOWN* eventually stops *UNKNOWN* .
and over 9 hours of battery life !
it has the best battery life out of all the *UNKNOWN* currently available .
you have to physically shut , down , *UNKNOWN* , plus remove the battery , then restart .
if the ratio of battery , life to cost is important to you , this is a decent *UNKNOWN* , except for the inevitable *UNKNOWN* failure .
battery life advertised at 10 .
5 hour battery life to anyone who was looking to make a *UNKNOWN* purchase *UNKNOWN* seems to have gotten a poor reputation based on their customer service and the faulty power cords they 've been sending out , but the *UNKNOWN* itself is a gem .
i love this *UNKNOWN* so far i have not been able to run out of battery 10 .
5 hour battery life is not true , if your doing anything other then nothing you will *UNKNOWN* get like 6 , 7 hour battery
battery performance could n't be more nice , as well as performance .
it boots up quickly , especially after getting rid of the extra *UNKNOWN* software that auto , boots at startup , its battery life is phenomenal , the screen is clear and easy to read , the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
*UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* , put in the battery , charged it up , everything was great .
the battery life lasted me about a good 6 , 7 hours of e , mail , internet , some *UNKNOWN* office work , and watched a video or 2 from streaming *UNKNOWN* .
only problem was when i went to *UNKNOWN* my battery for the second time ever owning this *UNKNOWN* , the power *UNKNOWN* was n't working .
i bought this *UNKNOWN* and the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* worked fine , but the battery would n't charge at all .
so i exchanged the bad *UNKNOWN* for a new one , but the new one is just like the first the battery will not charge at all .
i read the reviews before i first bought this *UNKNOWN* and was aware that there was an issue with the battery .
extra long battery life , pretty accurate *UNKNOWN* given
5 hour battery life was the one that caught my eye .
obviously , the battery drained out within hours .
battery life is longer than i had expected obviously 10 .
and even better , has a built in *UNKNOWN* , an *UNKNOWN* battery life , a great touch pad and exceptionally *UNKNOWN* design .
battery life around 6 hours playing games or *UNKNOWN* videos which in my book is simply awesome !

now i keep battery topped off or charge when not in use and no longer seems to be a problem .
this *UNKNOWN* has plenty of power for my needs and the battery life is great .

0 out of 5 stars initially battery problems , , however now it works , *UNKNOWN* 22 , *UNKNOWN*
in the mean time i let the battery go down completely turned out the battery would not charge , even though windows *UNKNOWN* was reporting it was .
when experiencing charging problems , let the battery go out completely .
noticed that the battery indicator started flashing orange , instead a steady orange .
after 3 *UNKNOWN* the battery was fully charged , unplugged the *UNKNOWN* , started up windows , and the battery indicator showed about 10 hours charge remaining .
the battery life is pretty good though the *UNKNOWN* is annoying .
what i loved is the battery :
the battery 's longevity is amazing i get around
it is designed to be as small as possible , and the long , life battery on the back end makes it tipsy .
excellent battery life , small and light enough to drop in a handbag and forget it 's there .
i tug it around for all my personal stuff and it is light , easy to carry and i really do get 10 hours plus use of the battery .
the battery on my *UNKNOWN* lasts almost 13 hours since i keep the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* relatively low .
it has the fastest processor currently available , huge battery , life 10 .
i bought this although i already have a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* for its light weight and long battery life .
indeed it runs as fast as advertised and battery life is excellent .
the most impressive on this is the battery life :
the battery life is incredible .
i spent a bit of time researching the various *UNKNOWN* currently available and thought that the *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* had a nice mix of style , battery life , *UNKNOWN* , and performance .
i have found the actual battery life to be around 8 hours .
the main selling point for this *UNKNOWN* is its amazing battery life .
the battery does n't add much bulk to the overall unit at all either .
for this extra amount , i was looking for the larger screen , the longer battery life and the keyboard *UNKNOWN* .
i have n't put it to the test on how long it actually lasts , but i use it off and on all day and i 've never had the battery go dead on me .
the long battery life is on and off .
sometimes it says that i have 70 % battery life and *UNKNOWN* :
saying that , i do n't have any battery saving settings set as i 'm not too familiar with that and have n't had the need .
the sound was n't all that great but hooking up some battery *UNKNOWN* speakers or headphones would be the way to go there .
the battery life last almost 4 hours with *UNKNOWN* use but i have the battery *UNKNOWN* that charges in no time .
i can easily get 8 hours on the battery life while running multiple programs and listening to music over the wireless internet .
i have not tried running the battery out quickly or seeing if i can shut things down to get the full 10 .
the image is nice and crisp and the longevity of the battery is a definite plus .
the battery life has been amazing so far .
very lightweight and portable and the battery life is outstanding .
i took this on a trip and the battery lasted about 6 hours before showing it was at 53 % .

5 hour battery life is really helpful .

battery life is great and it seems to charge fast as well .
on top of that , *UNKNOWN* tech support reports that the brick is out of stock and will not be available for 2 weeks and my battery is completely dead .
as a backup i purchased a second battery .
key features in my decision were b , *UNKNOWN* , & n wireless , built in *UNKNOWN* mouse capability , and the best in class battery life .
i bought this to take notes in college classes , so battery life was very important to me and it did not disappoint .
with the very first charge , i got nearly 10 hours of battery life .
the battery life is not its promised 10 .
0 out of 5 stars good *UNKNOWN* , exceptional battery , performance meets expectations .
pretty standard list of *UNKNOWN* for a *UNKNOWN* with the addition of *UNKNOWN* and a very long battery life .
the long battery life is awesome !
the battery is infinitely better , and i can easily squeeze 10 hours out of it if i need to .
when i learned about the battery life , the memory , hard drive , processor , *UNKNOWN* .
