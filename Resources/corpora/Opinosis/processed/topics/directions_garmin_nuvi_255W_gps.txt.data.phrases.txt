you also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
i used to hesitate to go out of my directions but not any more .
the directions did n't tell me anything i did n't already know after *UNKNOWN* with it for 10 minutes .
it also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .
it gives your heading not in terms of *UNKNOWN* but only in terms of one of eight directions .
the *UNKNOWN* is a plus and i highly recommend it , even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be *UNKNOWN* used for walking directions .
*UNKNOWN* 's *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is a *UNKNOWN* little device that provides excellent value , but more importantly spot on directions .
while i recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car , i note that some of the more impressive features of this *UNKNOWN* are literally one touch away , and so mounting the device close enough to you to *UNKNOWN* a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .
but leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you 're going to be just listening for directions , the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a *UNKNOWN* to a flame .
i 've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .
but for the most part , we find that the *UNKNOWN* software provides accurate directions , whereever we intend to go .
another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better , especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
i like how the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* does n't make you type in complete directions when it is n't necessary .
the only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and do n't indicate that you are *UNKNOWN* , you get to hear the *UNKNOWN* repeatedly *UNKNOWN* you because it has to *UNKNOWN* your directions .
no more firing up the computer , going to the site , printing the directions .
it speaks the directions so that you do n't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .
it allows for detours with directions on how to get back .
saves mobile phone minutes , because you do n't have to call and ask for directions .
traffic directions are as good and detailed as can be , as you would expect from a *UNKNOWN* , and less intrusive than on some other brands .
in closing , this is a fantastic *UNKNOWN* with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .
the sound is *UNKNOWN* , but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot , it gets really annoying .
however , the *UNKNOWN* gave me few wrong directions during my trip to *UNKNOWN* city .
0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions , *UNKNOWN* 6 , *UNKNOWN*
the directions are highly accurate down to a t .
depending on what you are using it for , it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest , but not always .
i tend to be a technological idiot but i figure this out , right out of the box and i had n't even read the directions yet , , this is major easy .
gives you immediate directions to get to the location you chose to set up as your home location .
allows you to type in two street names , and if they intersect , the *UNKNOWN* unit will give you directions to that intersection .
you can touch anywhere on the map and press go for directions to that location .
shows you your current latitude and longitude location , and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .
if you missed the spoken directions , you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
however , i much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
some of the verbal directions :
it should tell me to take the southwest drive exit , or the *UNKNOWN* gap road exit , like the highway sign says , or like i would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .
so , although the *UNKNOWN* does n't *UNKNOWN* those directions , i can look at the screen to see the exit i need to take .
directions seemed to focus on interstate travel and i have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid *UNKNOWN* .
it lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
directions were easy to see and understand .
the spoken directions are generally easy to understand .
since the directions are also displayed on the screen , i find the occasional *UNKNOWN* entertaining and not an issue .
it does know when you are not near a public road but it can not give directions to the road .
the spoken turn , by , turn directions are clear and very timely .
