both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .
the service was good , very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .
also , thanks to *UNKNOWN* the *UNKNOWN* for recommending grand *UNKNOWN* service .
the restaurant is not cheap but is very well *UNKNOWN* and the service is very good as is the food .
service was spotty front desk was marginally helpful .
this *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* hotel was charming , clean comfortable and the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* service was so helpful .
*UNKNOWN* service , great room , great location , could n't have asked for more .
it has some *UNKNOWN* in *UNKNOWN* , and all staff gave very good service to us .
the rooms were clean and updated , the beds were comfortable , and the *UNKNOWN* service was fast and efficient .
a highlight of our visit was the historic boats at the *UNKNOWN* street pier , , a national park service site that costs only $ 5 .
the service was quick and *UNKNOWN* checking in and out .
great location service and value !
so to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague
i did not take advantage of the *UNKNOWN* service , but i saw many people were receiving great service from them .
great value and service for the price !
excellent service , great location
the staff and service were exceptional .
the *UNKNOWN* can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants , although we tried *UNKNOWN* 's which was recommended to us and felt it was *UNKNOWN* for the service and quality .
i personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .
in addition , they advertise limousine service to the financial district but when i *UNKNOWN* they announce they had stopped the service and i would need to take mass transportation .
as i checked out i expressed my disappointment there were no *UNKNOWN* and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and i needed to make an appointment .
all employee 's that i mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .
we had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .
the rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well *UNKNOWN* .
wonderful service friendly people
seems service just is n't the way it used to be .
i *UNKNOWN* am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .
we have stayed at the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* on our last 3 trips to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , and i really ca n't fault the service .
the staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .
all the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the *UNKNOWN* cafe *UNKNOWN* are just as welcoming , with great service and the food is excellent .
we ate at the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .
never experienced the room service .
service was all good , albeit a bit stoic .
unfortunately we did n't get to dine in the hotel restaurant , but i 'd say it would be good , if the after hours service is anything to go by !
i 'd highly recommend the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* based on location , *UNKNOWN* of staff , aesthetics in the room and general overall service .
excellent service great location good value
the staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and *UNKNOWN* we did not avail his services , the *UNKNOWN* always seemed to be busy with guests giving *UNKNOWN* and advice .
there was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .
the food and service were both excellent .
this was probably not the best pick for us as we do n't like tourist areas and *UNKNOWN* wharf if one big tourist service .
there are many public transportation options including the cable cars , the trolley line and bus service .
the highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff , particularly the two *UNKNOWN* on duty while we were there .
their service was of the level and knowledge i would expect at at 5 , star hotel .
one day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest , and when we finally stepped out for about an hour , we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !
amenities , while this hotel is n't a luxury property , they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms , *UNKNOWN* bar , room service and an evening wine reception every day .
at this point i asked to be put through to best western customer services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .
they state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .
we dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $ 10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .
we were very impressed with the service we received .
the *UNKNOWN* service is second to none .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* has it all , *UNKNOWN* location , very close to public transport , very clean , *UNKNOWN* , friendly service and a supermarket opposite .
we found a great breakfast place just around the corner in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , called *UNKNOWN* 's cafe , good prices with *UNKNOWN* food and service .
*UNKNOWN* parking for $ 40 per night seems a bit steep , but at least the service was efficient and quick .
very clean , well maintained , with efficient , if not overly friendly service .
the hotel makes a big thing of the coffee *UNKNOWN* service in the morning , and this is quite nice .
i 'd say that , as far as the evening wine service is concerned , if you happen to be in the hotel , it 's fine .
did not eat at the restaurant , but room service was great .
overall , the stay at the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .
there are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .
the service in the hotel was really good .
the restaurant in the hotel , cafe *UNKNOWN* , does the breakfast run for room service , it was adequate but a little *UNKNOWN* .
lunch and dinner room service is provided by north beach pizza , which deliveries many *UNKNOWN* specialties including pasta , *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , sandwiches and of course , pizza .
however , there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1 , 4 block walk of this hotel , there is little reason to order room service .
we did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .
we did not eat at the hotel restaurant , we chose to eat at the *UNKNOWN* around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service , and they are open 24 hours .
maid service was prompt and outstanding .
very good hotel , great location , *UNKNOWN* extremely helpful , *UNKNOWN* is nice and the maid service was excellent .
the customer service was wonderful .
the adjacent cafe *UNKNOWN* was *UNKNOWN* for breakfast but had some *UNKNOWN* in service , but it was okay overall .
, provide service like high end hotels .
will store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight , want to spend more time , oldest *UNKNOWN* restaurant in the country *UNKNOWN* in walking distance , back east service , integrity , *UNKNOWN* .
split a fare *UNKNOWN* a private service i .
, we walked everywhere including up the hill to *UNKNOWN* tower then walked down just in time to attend 1300 service *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
the staff was so friendly and helpful and the *UNKNOWN* service was very knowledgeable .
a *UNKNOWN* was giving guests a massage at the same location , not sure if there was a charge involved for that service , as there was no information about that anywhere .
*UNKNOWN* service was very inadequate , though .
and the service was just *UNKNOWN* too .
the whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .
they say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but i was not impressed at all .
the *UNKNOWN* parking was *UNKNOWN* , the service was terrible , and the *UNKNOWN* was cold .
service was extra good , very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street which has the best breakfast in the world .
the service was fine with the exception of check , in .
from reading other reviews , it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .
nevertheless , i did like this hotel , the rooms , location , and most of the service and i would stay here again .
nice place but service could be better
overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .
when we finally found the church later , the service times she had given us were wrong , too .
speaking of parking , you 're going to have to pay and it 's going to have to be *UNKNOWN* service , as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
the hotel is pretty much as you 'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well *UNKNOWN* , and the staff were extremely helpful , very pleasant to deal with .
service was poor and they got our order wrong , but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .
great service and friendly front desk .
the *UNKNOWN* service is excellent .
*UNKNOWN* parking was $ 36 a day , but we 're not complaining because other *UNKNOWN* wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the *UNKNOWN* service .
this hotel is truly a value for the mid , level traveler looking for excellent *UNKNOWN* and the highest level of service anywhere !
but the maid service was excellent , it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .
the service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .
great location service and beer .
the hotel room was average although the service was good .
in accordance with the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* s *UNKNOWN* style theme a coffee tea *UNKNOWN* service was open from *UNKNOWN* till *UNKNOWN* in the mornings .
in the *UNKNOWN* from *UNKNOWN* till *UNKNOWN* a wine , beer and sparkling water service was available .
maid service was prompt , too .
the service is poor , and for those used to staying in *UNKNOWN* hotels .
there is simply not the service , oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .
it has *UNKNOWN* you need to have a great time in a great city , location , good service , great food , comfortable rooms and a *UNKNOWN* happy hour .
the cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .
room service at the hotel is limited :
the rooms are small but very clean , *UNKNOWN* decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard , *UNKNOWN* beds , plenty of *UNKNOWN* towels and smiling service .
i really did n't get a chance to experience the staff 's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
one other thing , i took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was terrible !
the *UNKNOWN* , in turn , told us to see the *UNKNOWN* , who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .
we ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service .
while we were making these arrangements , the *UNKNOWN* secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time .
found the food there to be quite nice , and our service was always prompt and efficient .
i planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and hotel chain we would receive good service .
the service was excellent , the room was terrific , the bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions of *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
very clean room , great location , wonderful service and dog friendly .
the personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem , it is immediately remedied .
worst *UNKNOWN* we 've ever stayed in as far as service goes .
we ate breakfast there one day and were appalled at the slow service , rude *UNKNOWN* , and *UNKNOWN* breakfast food .
i had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel , cafe *UNKNOWN* , and thought the food and the service were both very good .
the rooms were great and the service wonderful .
the only complaint i have is the *UNKNOWN* service .
the front desk is the worst service i have had in years .
and the hotel restaurant food and service was awful .
great rooms fantastic location and great service !
i would also urge other vistors to *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* with blue and gold fleet direct on there website before they arrive in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of *UNKNOWN* !
the food at the & *UNKNOWN* cafe & *UNKNOWN* is quite & *UNKNOWN* hotel , like & *UNKNOWN* but the service makes up for it .
friendly service was evident each day and the gentleman *UNKNOWN* was patient and helpful .
the *UNKNOWN* guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .
the hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality .
courteous , responsive service and a great location !
the service was good , the wine service each evening was very nice next to the fireplace , and the location was awesome !
the service was friendly and helpful at the front desk , but the *UNKNOWN* that i dealt with was not very good .
excellent staff and service and the adjoining *UNKNOWN* restaurant was superb .
a very cheerful staff and prompt service .
great people , service was *UNKNOWN* , especially during this *UNKNOWN* time !
teaming this hotel with the great food service *UNKNOWN* cafe *UNKNOWN* , i would definitely choose this hotel again while in *UNKNOWN* , an experience we wo n't ever forget .
i was also disappointed that the hotel 's & *UNKNOWN* room service & *UNKNOWN* came from a nearby *UNKNOWN* , but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .
being that i worked as a front desk person at a best western for quite awhile i was on the lookout for good service and facilities .
we asked her how to get back to the airport without having to pay the shuttle service $ 15 each .
and value is key for the rooms and the service !
the service is always great and the rooms very clean .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* service !
