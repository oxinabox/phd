i immediately starting noticing transmission surge during 2nd and 3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .
the transmission does n't shift correctly , and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .
i 'm pretty content with pretty much everything the car offers except the common issue of the transmission that does n't want to seem to work when you need it .
unlike the common concerns with the transmission , all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the *UNKNOWN* .
decent power for a 4 cylinder , but a dangerous hesitating transmission that *UNKNOWN* does not seem to want acknowledge or fix .
my *UNKNOWN* has been in the shop four times for the transmission problem and still has not been fixed .
first thing that come to me off the top of my head is the transmission .

the engine transmission was a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* affair .
here are the transmission problems i 've experienced :

at this rate , the transmission will go out *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* miles right after my warranty expires !
obviously they moved the costs around to provide for the new higher power *UNKNOWN* and the 6 speed transmission , which are so far the car 's only redeeming features !
*UNKNOWN* now has a fix for the accelerator hesitation and transmission problem !
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* engine and transmission *UNKNOWN* bulletin # *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* .
i 'm not sure what everyone talks about with hesitation transmission not enough power ?
the transmission cant make up its mind it *UNKNOWN* to shift .
transmission sticks in fourth gear and *UNKNOWN* surge while using the cruise control .
i am not having all the other issues everyone else is , not sure if its because mine is a manual transmission but i ca n't say how much i love it .
*UNKNOWN* may have computerized the engine and transmission to get better gas mileage but the very best i can get is 25 *UNKNOWN* on the highway .
while in cruise control and going up a slight *UNKNOWN* the transmission is constantly shifting and the *UNKNOWN* goes up and down by as much as 1500 *UNKNOWN* .
while driving on a straight and level road at about 40 mph the transmission is changing gears .
loved the car but two *UNKNOWN* failed within *UNKNOWN* miles before i got rid of the car .

terrible transmission that does n't shift right .
the significant transmission *UNKNOWN* are unacceptable and possibly unsafe , and the 4 *UNKNOWN* engine provides inadequate power when challenged .
i feel the *UNKNOWN* outweigh the negatives , but any prospective buyer should take a serious test drive under varying conditions and actually experience transmission *UNKNOWN* and the mediocre acceleration performance .
after one week , i found a rusted conjunction block , which *UNKNOWN* the transmission .
*UNKNOWN* , this is an auto transmission .
i hate the transmission as it always *UNKNOWN* to *UNKNOWN* when the power and speed is needed .
no problems with the transmission at all .

acceleration or transmission shifting :
quiet and refined ride , 4 *UNKNOWN* has sufficient power for everyday driving , and a smooth transmission that shifts well .
transmission not nearly as smooth as previous 4 speed .
the transmission does occasionally get confused and takes a while to select the right ratio , but this does not occur frequently .

transmission slips , especially when the car is cold .
transmission replacement did not resolve the problem .

the transmission is seamless and , with six forward gears , the engine is virtually never strained in ordinary driving .
8 transmission hunts for gears *UNKNOWN* side head liner molding *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* during a slow down .
however i have noticed , like others , that the new transmission is not that smooth , especially when accelerating from a stop .

the 5 speed transmission shifts like one would with a manual .
the transmission , or more specifically , the power transfer is scary .
the *UNKNOWN* of the transmission shifting seemed to help for awhile , but it 's reverted back .
