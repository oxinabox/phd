i previously owned a *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* which had incredible build quality and reliability .
i bought the *UNKNOWN* because of *UNKNOWN* reliability and quality .
i purchased a 2007 *UNKNOWN* because of the looks of the redesigned model and because of the legendary *UNKNOWN* quality and reliability .
as of today , i am a bit disappointed in the build quality of the car .
disappointed in interior and exterior quality .
*UNKNOWN* did a great job with design but forgot about quality !
this car needs quality improvement !
the fit and finish in the cabin is not the level of quality i expected .
this car looks great and the build quality is good .
i am so disappointed in the quality .
i 've had 2 *UNKNOWN* 's before the one , and bought it thinking that the quality standards known to a *UNKNOWN* would still remain excellent .
it 's now apparent that *UNKNOWN* quality took a nose dive .
mine suffers from the *UNKNOWN* slip on the 3 , 4 *UNKNOWN* when cold , build quality is good but nothing like the *UNKNOWN* , hype i was expecting , as it has its share of *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* just like a 10 year old *UNKNOWN* .
overall a good car , no build quality issues yet .
after owning a 95 *UNKNOWN* , i expected the same quality .
the quality of construction , ride , *UNKNOWN* , and *UNKNOWN* are excellent .
a lot of defects that i still do not understand how my car passed the quality inspection when it was manufactured .
this car offers poor driver 's seat comfort , poor vision , only average ride quality , gas mileage
*UNKNOWN* radio is low quality *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , and *UNKNOWN* all sound the same .
it has high quality amazing ride and the fit and finish is great .
however , the quality of this car is not acceptable for *UNKNOWN* standards .
initial quality was lacking and it 's only getting worse .
this is our 6th *UNKNOWN* and we continue to receive the quality we expect .
s not worth buying given the quality issues .
seems the company 's quest to be # 1 has caused quality issues .
interior quality is very poor .
this was the 7th *UNKNOWN* and the last , i feel *UNKNOWN* quality is slipping big time .
this is not the *UNKNOWN* quality i was expecting .
interior exterior quality is very good .
overall build quality very good .
replaced speakers with *UNKNOWN* speakers , sound quality improved .
the ride , comfort , and drive is as expected , however , the quality and reputation of *UNKNOWN* are completely gone for the flagship *UNKNOWN* .
it 's not a terrible car by any means , but the quality since they starting building them in *UNKNOWN* has really slipped .
horrible quality of interior .
some have mentioned disappointing build quality .
as compared to my wife 's 2004 *UNKNOWN* , my new *UNKNOWN* does not exhibit the same build quality .
while i applaud the new design , *UNKNOWN* seems to be slipping in quality .
the ride , the fit and the build quality are what i was expecting after owning *UNKNOWN* in the past .
this 2007 is the epitome of the *UNKNOWN* 's quality .
i also am not impressed with the quality .
the sound quality is excellent and answering or dialing a call could n't be easier .
solid , high quality , comfortable and quiet .
depends on gas quality & wind conditions .
the fit and finish quality is poor .
*UNKNOWN* 's quality is slipping .
i paid for quality & all i 've gotten thus far is not quality .
i drive quality cars and i can attest to the fact this car rides as well as some cars costing considerably more .
it is a pleasure to drive and it has *UNKNOWN* quality written all over it .
great performance , great gas mileage , superior quality , i always thought of a *UNKNOWN* as just a practical family sedan .
quality of assembly is outstanding .
*UNKNOWN* has this supposed *UNKNOWN* quality .
so far the quality appears to be strong , as expected .
high quality inside outside finish
the quality of the leather seats appears to be very good .
my third *UNKNOWN* and by far the worst , the paint is of poor quality .
some quality issues with fit and finish .
i have *UNKNOWN* on both b pillars and the build quality is rather poor , with *UNKNOWN* gaps in the passenger side dash where it does not fit together properly .
transmission hunts for gears , ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car , auto sound level does n't work , accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or *UNKNOWN* is on , radio shuts off when engine is shut off .
excellent interior build quality .
was sold by the reputation for quality , reliability , and the 2007 *UNKNOWN* .
vehicle ride is extremely smooth , *UNKNOWN* and quiet , very close to *UNKNOWN* quality for thousands of dollars less .
the new 2007 *UNKNOWN* should have the higher quality than 1997 *UNKNOWN* , but not in my case .
i just feel the car is quality throughout .
the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* is a high quality car at a very affordable price .
however , the quality is absolutely terrible for a *UNKNOWN* .
i will keep this car , but i hope *UNKNOWN* improves their quality to their older standards of the mid 90s .
my transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .
i was driving 91 *UNKNOWN* for long time and it 's quality deeply impressed me .
while i love the design , the poor components , sub , par fit , and , finish , poor quality control , and unreliable work on the part of dealership *UNKNOWN* will make me question the quality of any future *UNKNOWN* vehicle .
i love the car 's visual and aesthetic design , but quality is just as important and for that reason , i would not recommend the new *UNKNOWN* to anyone !
i had always heard that *UNKNOWN* had the best quality cars .
