" Yes, the courtyard rooms are dark, but we weren't there much during the day anyway ."												
" Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us ."

"I'm not sure why so many people say the rooms are small here, but our standard king size bed room was huge in my opinion ."												
"My family stayed at the Tuscan Inn April 20, 25 in two connecting rooms ."												
"My husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in march, I was concermed by the number of comments regarding the size of the rooms ,  yes they are a little on the small size but as there was only 2 of us plus my toddler daughter we found them to be more than adequate and very family friendly particularly liked the lock on the mini bar fridge door which housed a seemlessly endless supply of candy !"												
Our family of five stayed in two rooms at the Tuscan Inn for two nights during the first week in January .												
"Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side ."												
pthe only negative thing's i will say is that the coffee maker in the room is a dreadfull waste of space and thee coffee pods and i stick of sugar and 2 pouches of milk a day is ridiculas there are no tea coffee making facilitys in the rooms to be honest as the coffee maker is just plain crazy .

"Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again"												
"Very cleanSmall rooms, but have a couch, chair, desk, etc ."												
"Very comfortable beds and rooms ,  nice decor !"
