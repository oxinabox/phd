"We arrived at 23,30 hours and they could not recommend a restaurant so we decided to go to Tesco, with very limited choices but when you are hingry you do not careNext day they rang the bell at 8,00 hours to clean the room, not being very nice being waken up so earlyEvery day they gave us a candy bar and two bottlets of water whic is a very nice touch ."

" About the hotel, the first room given to us was having stained and patchy carpet and the duvet was also stained ."																															
" About the only negative thing I can say about the room, was that when the sofa chair was pulled out into the single bed for the third adult, there was absolutely only about 4 inches between the end of the bed and the desk in order to pass to go to the bathroom ."																															
 After many phone calls and visits to the front desk regarding not being able to connect with the internet I was finally told it was not working in our room and they knew that it wasn't when we checked in .																															
 After realizing that the room was 'Smoking  we went downstairs to change rooms and they told us the entire hotel was booked .																															
" Also when we booked the hotel we were told we would have a double bed and a single bed but at check in were told we had a fold down bed that when folded down stopped my daughter and myself from using the bathroom, the only way was to climb over the bed ."																															
" Also, one of my colleagues wanted to leave his room key for his wife but the front desk staff wouldn't allow him to do so ."																															
" Although my room was only on the fourth floor, the noise, proofing was quite impressive, and I could barely hear street noise from Cromwell Road ."																															
" Although smokers tend to get relegated to the worst rooms  , i was happy with my 6th floor room ."																															
 Although the dining room was very busy it didnt seem like a cattle market .																															
" Although the room was small, it was comfortable and clean, , especially the pillows and king size bed !"																															
" Although we had email confirmation that the room was prepaid, the check in staff insisted that the “back office” didn’t actually take payment and wanted us to pay again ."																															
 and got the room right away even though the check in time is at 2 p .																															
" Arrived, didn't get the room we paid for or booked ,  apparently they are allowed to do this and its in the small print !"																															
 As a priority club member I expected to have a decent room but this was not the case .																															
" As expected, the room was smaller than the usual American hotel, but clean   quiet with fairly new furnishings ."																															
" As other reviewers have remarked, our room was small, and designed for only the purposes of bathing, watching TV, and sleeping ."																															
" As others have mentioned, the room is small, a bit bigger than a room on a cruise ship, but it’s immaculate, has a small refrigerator, and has a well appointed bathroom with vanity and full tub and shower ."																															
" As the other comments point out, rooms are generally small, but the level of comfort is high as rooms are modern and rooms have been updated recently ."																															
" The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so ."																															
 Exceptional rooms and service !																															
" Basic necessities like iron, tea kettle, multiple TV channels, safe deposit lockers, newspaper are always available in the room as standard equipment   and there are no surprises ."																															
 Bathroom also was very clean with no smell of chemistry .																															
 Bathroom looked new   was clean .																															
" Bathroom was comparable to an average North American hotel, which means fairly big for Europe ."																															
 Bathroom was nice with good shower .																															
 Bathroom was small but this room was typical size of many London   hotel rooms .																															
 Bathroom was smaller than U .																															
" Bathrooms have tub showe combos, and the computerized climate control is great ."																															
" Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !"																															
" Because of the room size, the lack of continental breakfast for those who reserve outside of the Holiday Inn web site, and the distance to many attractions, we WILL NOT STAY in the hotel during our next trip to London ."																															
" Bed was comfortable, but the room was very hot, even with the window open ."																															
 both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .																															
" Breakfast in the Forum Room was good, although occasionally supplies   ran out on the buffet ."																															
" Breakfast was included in our room rate ,  and it was a great feast ,  lots of fresh fruit, interesting sausages, Japanese breakfast option ,  and the big dining room had a nice buzzy holiday feel to it ."																															
" Breakfast was included in the room and we utilized it each morning, as the hotel restaurant was adequate ."																															
" Broadbadn access in the rooms is fine, but can slow down at peak times of the evening, the cost is also excessive ."																															
" But I really liked the hotel ,  the rooms were decently sized, there was a nice bank of lifts in the lobby, and again, the staff was friendly, which goes a long way when you've just got off a ten hour flight ."																															
" But I wouldn't splurge on the executive room ,  it isn't worth it !"																															
" But the room was clean, the bathroom was modern with tub and shower and all the hot water we wanted and there was a hairdryer ."																															
" But, the room was bright and airy and a decent size ."																															
" By European standards, our room was large ."																															
" Check in was prompt, and the room clean and tidy, a bit small, but this is central London ."																															
" Check in was very easy, we we happy to learn that our room was ready at 11am and they up graded our room ."																															
" check, in was quick, staff was helpful and rooms were clean  just to be very picky on details, restroom looked like it might have needed some refurbishment sometimes in the near future and also there wasn't actually much spare space in the room, but I assume it wouldn't have been much better in other hotels in London ."																															
" Check, in was simple, and we made our way to the room in an elevator lift that whisked us up to the 20th floor in a matter of seconds ."																															
" Check, in was super, quick, the rooms was spot, on and breakfast was more than elaborate ."																															
" Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent ."																															
" Complaining again to reception got me a double room, which they said at check in was not available ."																															
" Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough ."																															
" Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed ."																															
" Early check, in only allowed  smoking  room, but it was entirely acceptable, and only the hallway had faint smke odor ."																															
 Even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger !																															
" Even though I requested a true king or queen bed, our room was a 2 twin that was hastily assembled into a king which meant that one of us was always falling into the gap between the beds ."																															
" Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location ."																															
" Executive room was clean and of a reasonable size, however the bathroom was one of the smallest I have ever seen ."																															
" firm, comfortable beds  windows that open  adequate mirrors  clothes drying line across bathtub  sinks and showers drained properly  stopper in sink sealed, which was good because we did our own laundry  night shades overlapped the window and each other enough to keep light out  mini, bar refrigerator ran quietly  free newspapers daily in elevator waiting areas  in, room safe  American sized wash cloths  all lights worked  enough electrical outlets  enough hangers  central air conditioning which worked and ran quietly  adequate elevators  no toilet problems  shower curtains sealed water from leaking onto the floor  anti, slip surface on bathtub shower  exhaust system in bathroom removed condensation from shower  always enough hot water in shower ."																															
" First was about a short que  , then about that he needed to go to the back room to check out if he could give me a double room instead of single and the thirth time that the printer was slow ."																															
 Firstly air conditioning in our room developed a fault during on evening but despite three calls to reception nobody appeared to take any action and the fault was finally cleared the following day .																															
" Front desk efficient, concierge was busy and helpful, room was adequate and very clean ."																															
 Getting to the rooms was slowed by construction crews working on other floors and a horrible elevator which requires your room key to operate .																															
" good size considered it is in london, comfy double bed, clean in room, tea coffee choc making facilities, hairdryer under desk, old tv, toilet facilities was disgusting, long curly black hair in bathtub, big black pubic hair tangled in hand towel, disgusting yellow scum stick on toilet seat, dove shampoo bottle near bathtub and dove cream cleanser bottle near hand basic were both empty, cheap plastic canteen cups on wash basin, only one tiny hand soap, NO supply of essential basic vanity kits   only available if ask, cheap standard chain hotel decor, room was quiet, did not hear anything from the street, but doors closed loudly from nearby rooms on the corridor ."																															
 Got my room through Priceline   and was more than impressed .																															
 Had it not been for the hotel confirmation that I made a copy of they did not want to give us a room even though it was already paid for months in advance .																															
" Hotel rooms are expensive in London so if you want something convenient, cheapish and near to a Tube this is ideal but be wary of the fact that this is a massive hotel and there will be queues for breakfast, check in, etc ."																															
" Hotel was able to give us a two bed non, smoking room which is exactly what we wanted ."																															
" however the corridors to our room had a pungent smell of deep heat, walls were covered in marks and the gerenal appearance of public areas is dusty and old fashioned ."																															
" However, bathroom was so tiny it would have given a claustrophobic some problems !"																															
" However, I'd be sure to request a room AWAY from Cromwell Rd due to the noise issue ."																															
" However, if the room rates were the same and or I was using my Priority Club points I would choose the Holiday Inn Kensington across the street   ."																															
" However, no in, room safe which is a bit disappointing ."																															
																															
" However, the room was not very large but one does not expect to get a large room in London ."																															
 I arrived at 1030am and my executive level room on the 5th floor was ready   .																															
" I do wish they had double rooms with double beds, but I was so exhausted when I went to be, I don't believe I even turned over, so I managed with the twin bed just fine ."																															
 I found the pendant for the necklace lodged in a crack where it must have landed when the room was cleaned .																															
 I found the room size to be acceptable athough I was one person traveling alone .																															
" I had pre booked my room through the priority club, I'm a platinum member and on checking in the reception told me their was only a twin room left ."																															
" I had requested a room on a non smoking floor, but ended up having to take a room on a smoking floor that was on the end of a hall ."																															
" I have experience with the small size of some European hotels, but this hotel room was the smallest I have encountered ."																															
 I have to say that the room was a bit small but not uncomfortable .																															
 I made the reservation 2 moths ago requesting for 2 connecting rooms and was told could not guarantee connecting rooms until later .																															
" I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly ."																															
 I originally asked for a room above the 10th floor looking over London but that side of the hotel was fully booked so got and upgrade to an executive room .																															
 I politely explained about my shock at being given a completely different room than what was booked !																															
" I really cannot comment on the rate because we had a package deal for the entire trip, and I don't have a clue what our room rate was ."																															
" I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro ."																															
" I think it is a good idea that you have to use your room card to get the elevator moving, it is just a security issue ."																															
 I was booked into the same room as the one I complained about last time and the TV is still not fixed !																															
" I was 'upgraded' to a room that wasn't stunning or large ,  hate to think what regular room is like ."																															
" I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price ."																															
" If I had paid more than $100 for my room, I would have been disappointed ."																															
" If this is your first time to the UK and you travel a lot in the US, the room size is small ."																															
 If you are a tourist who will only be in the room to sleep and shower this is the place for you .																															
" If you upgraded to the next level room, the fridge was stocked ."																															
" I'll admit that it was a bit confusing at first to have to use the room key to turn on the lights and select a floor on the elevator, but it wasn't a big imposition ,  again it was just different from what Americans expect ."																															
" In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay ."																															
" In other words, if the room is already hot, you will not be able to cool it down unless you ask that the AC be turned on, or unless you open a window   ."																															
" In the sliding, door bathroom, there was no hair dryer, common amenities like shower caps, shampoo, etc ."																															
" Initially, I was disappointed in the small size of the room, but adjusted to it, and by the time we left ,wondered why I was initially concerned !"																															
" Instead of an executive room with a king bed and a wonderful breakfast each day at the MG, this trip we paid more to stay at this Holiday Inn and definitely had fewer and less posh amenities ."																															
 Instead of Mini Bar my room had just the hole where it normally is placed and some hanging cables .																															
" It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time ."																															
 It is common across Europe to have small rooms and this was small for a double .																															
 It is hardly intuitive and unless sometime tells you won't know what to do with the room key unless you've stayed in hotels that use this kind of system !																															
" It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good ."																															
 It proved good value for a regular room but the advertised extras to justify the  executive   tag were not all there .																															
																															
 It was a good quality room although the bed was and pillows were very firm .																															
 it was a twin room and was barely big enough for one person .																															
" It was clean, the maids were fantastic, our room was surprisingly large  , and the beds were comfortable ."																															
" It was nice to have a frig in the room, we bought juice and croisants each morn from a local store and stored them ."																															
 It was not available in our room and was very expensive   to use in the lobby area .																															
 it was very hard to move around the room when the sofa bed was pulled out   as another reviewer said you'd have to crawl to move around  .																															
" Let's face it, just because the hotel is 4 star does NOT mean your room will be, but this really isn't too bad ."																															
" Mind you, hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the States, but this room was MORE than enough room for the two of us !"																															
" My bathroom was, like the room, small ."																															
 My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .																															
" My friends were given a two bed room which was considerably smaller but, like mine, was clean and stocked with the necessities ."																															
 My husband and I stayed in one of their suites a few years ago over Christmas and the only complaint I had about it was that the sofa in the living room of the suite was as hard as a rock .																															
 My only gripe about the room was that the hot water was not very hot .																															
 My room   was positively huge by European standards .																															
" My room had the usual exec features of the bathrobe and slippers and as a Priority Club Platinum member, my gift was a half bottle of wine, which was just what was needed after a hard day ."																															
" My room itself was a little worn and torn, , I was in a non, smoking room and my comforter had cigarette burns on it ."																															
 My room was a typical London size i .																															
" My room was clean and well furnished, with a a comfortable 5ft bed ."																															
" My room was clean with tea and coffee making facilities, but there was wallpaper coming away from the walls and there was no cover on the bed, simply a duvet in a white sheet ."																															
" My room was clean, although since I only stayed one night I cannot comment about ongoing housekeeping ."																															
" My room was non, smoking and did not smell like smoke ."																															
 My room was small but it was clean and everything was okay except for the wireless internet which kept going in and out every 5 minutes .																															
 My room was very clean and the tube was close by .																															
" My room was very clean, bed was comfy and always made by the time I arrived back each day ."																															
" My wife adds the bathroom was very clean, with nice towels and hot water every day ."																															
" No other problems ,  the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked ."																															
" No problem said the receptionist I will fast track your room so it will be available at that time, and here is the key holder with the number of your room for when you return ."																															
" no standard room was available 40 minutes before announced check, in right in time 30 minutes after   ."																															
" Non, smoking room and floor was actually non, smoking !"																															
" Not sure what the regular rate is for a room, but I personally would not pay more than $100 for this hotel ."																															
" Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc ."																															
 Nothing to say that this room was a  priceline  room .																															
" OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side, and it's a tad noisy generally of an evening, but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main arterial routes into London ?"																															
 On arrival we were allocated a twin room and when I called to enquire about changing I was told that there was no record of my request for a double room and that non were available .																															
" On arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly valet who parked our car for us   and we were able to leave our luggage as we were early and the room was not ready ."																															
 On opening the door to the room we had a real disappointment .																															
" On the plus side, the staff in the breakfast room was wonderful and friendly, as was the fine waitress the one night we had dessert at the ground, floor restaurant ."																															
" Once we had access to our room on the 14th floor, we were pleasantly surprised ."																															
" Only negative was that the room, fitted with twin beds, was small even for just two adults ."																															
" Other than that, our stay was uneventful and the room was clean, if a bit small ."																															
" Otherwise the room was fine for one, but was rather compact and would have been too cramped for two people ."																															
 our air conditioner leakes in one room so they moved us right away which was very nice .																															
" Our first room had an unbearable odor from an unflushed toilet which made me think,  Who else is using the room when guests are not using them ."																															
 Our room had all of the facilities listed including fridge which came in handy .																															
 Our room on the third floor was too near the road and a little noisy .																															
" Our room rate included two full breakfasts, free bottled water and Kitkat candy bars each day and was very competitive with the rates at other hotels we considered ."																															
" Our room was clean, spacious and smart ."																															
" Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !"																															
" Our room was more than comfortable for two but when me made up the third bed the room was incredibly cramped ,  then again this is Central London  !"																															
 The rooms were extremely small however and with the couch turned into a bed it was impossible to get from the bed to the bathroom .																															
 Our room was on the 5th floor of this very tall and bunker like hotel building and it faced Cromwell Road .																															
 Our room was small but tasteful .																															
 Our room was smaller than expected .																															
 Our room was spacious by London standards and had all the amenities we needed .																															
 Our room was typical holiday inn the bathroom could have done with updating but was spotless .																															
 The hotel was clean and the room was a decent size .																															
" our room, which was a handicap access room due to the crowded season, was actually a great choice, as the bath is large, light filled and with updated fixtures ."																															
" Our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc ."																															
" Our rooms weren't ready when we arrived  , which was fine  but they also weren't ready for hours after the official check, in time ."																															
" Our westward facing room was on the 17th floor, and we saw a couple of beautiful sunsets out the windows, sharing wine and cheese that we’d purchased at the Waitrose supermarket a block away on Gloucester Rd or at the Sainsbury supermarket two blocks down Cromwell Rd ."																															
" Overall I couldn't have been more satisfied and far from assigning me a humble room because I'd booked a discounted Hotwire rate, I was given a room upgrade !"																															
" Overall, I would describe the room as free of serious problems, but drab and in need of modernisation or livening up ."																															
" Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then ."																															
 People are saying the rooms are small but one I was in was very much the Holiday inn standard size room and was in good condition .																															
 People asked to be changed rooms all the time and this was not my first time staying in hotels .																															
																															
 Room 2519 is where the only ice machine and a microwave are located .																															
 Room rate including continental breakfast was very competitive .																															
 Room size is fine and bathroom is good .																															
" Room was a nice size,clean and modern ."																															
" Room was an Executive Club floor room and was larger than average for a London Holiday Inn, well laid out and everything worked !"																															
 Room was clean and bathroom was compact and modern .																															
" Room was clean, comfortable, modern ."																															
 Room was cleaned with fresh towels etc upon our return later that afternoon .

" Room was small but perfectly kitted out ,  spotless with thoughtful facilities like retractable clothes line over the bath , mini, bar, hair, dryer etc ."																															
" Room was small, but that's the case in Europe ."																															
 Room was still a small European style room .																															
" Room was very modern and clean, too, and everything worked bar the kettle which was replaced with a brand new one in 15 minutes ."																															
 Room wasn't luxurious but did exactly what we wanted in that it was clean and had a comfy bed !																															
 Rooms are clean and good size by English standards .																															
 Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .																															
" She called housekeeping, and the room was ready in 10 minutes !"																															
" She was quick to add, however, that she would be willing to give us a free upgrade to an executive room for 1 night, which would normally cost us GBP35, but for the inconvenience, she would waive this upgrade fee for the first night only ."																															
" Small, with soft beds the room served well for the night we stayed and the card controlled lift access was a nice feature which made the hotel feel more secure ."																															
" So on check out, not only did the staff try to take another payment, they tried to take it at normal room rates and not the discounted rate !"																															
 Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .																															
" Staff were very pleasant , especially the breakfast staff  Rooms were not particularly spacious but were clean and adequate, bathroom was modern but shower was not very powerful ."																															
 Standard room was VERY clean and seemed new or newly renovated .																															
" standards, but it had been recently refurbished   and the bathroom was quite nice ."																															
" Still, the room was comfortable enough  and clean, although some of the fixtures and fittings were slightly worn, e ."																															
 Take a look at the breakfast room to see just how big an issue size is .																															
" Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it ."																															
" That said, most London rooms are small and as we were only sleeping there, it was not really a problem ."																															
" that there didn't really seem to be a functioning air vent in our bathroom so it was a bit of a sauna after you used the shower, and 2 ."																															
" That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast ."																															
" the bathroom door is a slide, door as there is no room for a normal hinged door ."																															
 The bathroom in our room was immaculately clean .																															
																															
" The bathroom is bright and clean, with a modern tub and good water pressure ."																															
" The bathroom is small, but well equipped ."																															
" The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite ."																															
 The bathroom was a good size with an excellent shower and was spotlessly clean .																															
 The bathroom was also new and beautifully tiled .																															
" The bathroom was also small, and the water pressure in the shower was not great ."																															
" The bathroom was also tiny, and the water pressure abysmally low ."																															
" The bathroom was BRANDNEW and so clean that I even bathed in the tub, which ordinarily I would not do at a hotel ."																															
 The bathroom was clean and modern with a sliding door not enough room for a standard door as it would hit the wardrobe !																															
 The bathroom was generally spotless throughout .																															
 The bathroom was immaculate everytime we returned to the hotel and the water pressure in the shower is fabulous .																															
 the bathroom was looking tired aswell .																															
 The bathroom was modest in size and had a tub .																															
 The bathroom was more than we expected for an English hotel .																															
" The bathroom was ok, however there seemed to be a lack of water pressure, so the shower was a kin to standing under a tap ."																															
" The bathroom was small, and water pressure was weak, but it was doable ."																															
" The bathroom was small, but the tub was deep   ."																															
 the bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door as there wasnt enough room to open a door .																															
" The bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door, and not the regular swinging kind ."																															
 The bathroom was spotless and clearly recently renovated .																															
" The bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen, but did include a full, size tub shower combination ."																															
" The bathrooms are basic with soap dispensers reminiscent of a gym, but were uniquely clean without dirty corners even to a critical eye ."																															
" The bed was perfectly comfortable, I had ample desk space for my work and my bathroom was much bigger than I expected ."																															
 The bedroom was small   but the bathroom was good sized and exceptionally clean .																															
" The bedroom, although recently upgraded with a new bed   had wall paper that was unstuck at the seams throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand ,  the TV was an outdated model ."																															
 The bedrooms are very small and the breakfast is very ordinary although there is a good choice .																															
" The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny as well ."																															
 The beds were not very comfortable and the door to the bathroom was a sliding door that did not lock .																															
" The breakfast room is  cattle market  like with queues for tables and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel ."																															
 The Concierge desk called our room to ask if we needed any information or assistance .																															
 The decor of the hotel and the rooms looks cheapand not worth the money I was paying .																															
" The disappointment was that when we got to our room the extra bed was infact a sofa and it was not ready, which at that time of night was quite inconvenient ."																															
" The English breakfast besides having eggs, meat, mushrooms   baked beans also had better fruit than was generally available with the continental breakfast ."																															
" The hotel exterior is a bit plain, but the room was comfortable ."																															
" The hotel itself is in need of an upgrade, its getting a bit tired, but saying that, the room was clean ."																															
" The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms were comfortable, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the check in desk was always well staffed so it only took 2 minutes to check in and out ."																															
 The hotel room was definitely as spacious and clean as all the hotels I've stayed in mainland Europe .

 The rooms are very small and can feel kind of cramped when changing and stuff is on the bed .																															
 The rooms have an electric tea kettle and the tea and cream is provided .

 The view from our 19th floor room was wonderful and included Big Ben and the London Eye  .																															
" The view was good to the south and the room was surprisingly large, with a small refrigerator, desk, TB and double bed ."																															
 The views from the higher rooms are just fantastic and the male desk person who checked me in was very nice and gave me a room on a high floor .																															
" The website offers a standard room for less money, but we were told by the hotel that the only way to be guaranteed a non, smoking room was to upgrade to a King, so we paid extra ."																															
" There are individual temperature controls in the room, which was great ."																															
" There are no ironing facilities in standard rooms but there is an ill, publicised ironing room on floor 26 ,  you'll need to ask for directions ."

 There was no room once sofa bed was down as we had to climb over it to get to toilet once our daughter was in bed .																															
" There was quite obviously a large choice of rooms available and the female check in receptionist managed to find me a non, smoking twin room with a view of london no problem   all the way over to what I assume to be Hammersmith ."																															
 There were a few marks and rips on wallpaper etc but overall room was in good shape and both room and bath were clean .																															
" These were minor issues, considering how great the room was ."																															
" They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town ."																															
 They changed our room for the rest of our stay but the room was not as nice and had a smaller folding bed   .																															
 They currently appear to be renovating the rooms once this is one I am sure it will be even better !																															
" They have a luggage room, which is great if you are arriving early or need to leave your luggage after checking out ."																															
" They moved my stuff to room 1524, which was wonderful ."																															
" This is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem ."

" Tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay ."																															
" TV is placed in the room such that, if you try watching for a while, it is guaranteed that you will get stiff neck ."																															
 Two people couldn't walk within the room at the same time but I guess that is a problem with most hotels in Europe .																															
" Upon arrival to the room itself, we discover that we have in fact been given a disabled, non smoking room ."																															
" Upon returning to the room after the false alarm, he was nowhere to be seen, so I connected the TV up and put the trolley outside the room ."																															
" Usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non, smoking rooms, not this time ."																															
 Very small rooms I think our room on our last cruise was larger !																															
 View was excellent from the room although weather was terrible during my stay .																															
" We  upgraded  our room from a standard to an excutive room for and extra 175 pounds   and got a room that was maybe 150 sq ft, the bathroom was tiny and had a pocket door that was heavy and hard to close, the whole room needed to be updated ."																															
" We also requested a room change, but for some reason this never worked out, but then again, we weren't in the room for much time as we were out sight, seeing ."																															
" We arrived about 11 am, room was ready ."																															
" We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in, and were delighted when we were offered a free upgrade to a kingsize room, although this was a smoking room, there wasn't too bad a smell, and we just opened the windows ."																															
" We booked direct on the hotel website and paid 75 pounds per room per night, which is extremely good for London and for the quality of the rooms ."																															
" We booked the room as a triple, and were pleasantly surprised to find three single beds, rather than a double and a sofa bed ."																															
 We booked through priceline and got the room for $70 US per night which was a steal !																															
 We did ask for a high room but that was ignored i think !																															
" We ended up taking the second room as we already wasted an hour dealing with it, and just wanted to get on with our day ."																															
" We found the hotel rooms to be very clean, especially the recently refurbished bathrooms ."																															
" We got in about 9am to the Holiday Inn, and the room wasn't ready yet   ."																															
" We got there very early, so no non, smoking rooms were available, but the luggage room was convenient ."																															
 We had a renovated room and it was really lovely and clean .																															
" We had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy, considering the small hotel rooms I have in previous trips to London ."																															
" We had a twin room on the 17th floor ,  it was a great room, with a great view ."																															
 We had arrived early and were prepared to wait for our room however we were offered an upgrade to an executive room because our allocated room was not yet ready .																															
" We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly ."																															
 We had two rooms with an interconnecting door which was a perfect arrangement and the accessible room had plenty of room for the wheelchair with a big bathroom   .																															
" We knew the rooms were small, but ours wasn't too small ."																															
 We made our way to the room and a real pain is the fact that every time you use the lift you have to put your key card in before the button will work .																															
 We only had breakfasts in the hotel and were not impressed for it to be served in a room that was not really a restaurant .																															
 We requested a room on a high floor before we left and this wish was granted with a 15th floor room with a view for miles it was great !																															
" We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip, and both times our double room was clean, comfortable, and a good size ."																															
 We stayed at the Holiday Inn for about a week and the room was clean and quiet .																															
 We stayed in a triple room which was supposed to be the biggest they had .																															
 We then went down to reception and had to provide a description of the contents of our room while the Manager on duty then inspected the room to ascertain that it was ours .																															
 We then went to our room on the second floor and discovered a Queen bed .																															
 We used room service one night and it was excellent .																															
 We were given a standard double room on the 27th floor which is the top floor .																															
" We were not allowed into the room until 2pm ,  it seemed to be policy, regardless of whether or not our room was ready as all the other people in the check, in queue got the same message ."																															
" We were upgraded to an Executive Room, which was fantastic , ,  double bed, lots of room, couch for extra seating ."																															
 We were very pleased with our room which also had aircon as it was very hot in London at that time .																															
" We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service ."																															
" What happened is the room was near where the maids came and went so you were always hearing thumps of doors opening and slamming, plus whoever occupied the room next to me was always coming and going well into the night ."																															
 What we got was a room where the hotel wall was on the left side and a roof under our window with full of cabbage .																															
" When I arrived in my room with two small children the previous occupier had left unused medicine in the mini bar, this took until the following evening to get someone to remove this ."																															
" When I finally got my turn she said four words to me,  name   sorry  I spelt out my name  credit card  I did think for a moment that she might say  Pin  or tell me my room number but obviously i wasnt worth the effort ."																															
" when i told them that my room is a smoking room   I specified in my reservation that its non, smoking the employee asked me  I wonder how could you specify that    there was other incidents as well ."																															
 When I tried to check in early the receptionist persuaded me to purchase an 'upgrade' to an executive room as that was available but the regular room that I booked wasn't .																															
 When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk told us that the double room we booked is not available because their reservation centre had overbooked the hotel .																															
" When we stepped into the room it was an even greater relief, on the 17th floor we had a wonderful view of Earl’s Court and some Georgian architecture, our favorite visual was an advertisement against smoking, in which there was a cigarette half un, wrapped with what appeared to be a fatty clogged artery inside ."																															
 When we tried to use a phone card from our room it would not work so I asked the front dest to help me and was told they couldn't really !																															
 While the room is small what does one expect for less than $200 night in London ?																															
 Why some people moan about the size of their room is beyond me .																															
" Within the same complex is a Boots and Waitrose so filling the provided in, room fridge with snacks is a doddle ."																															
" Yes the rooms are small, but realistically, how much time do you spend in the room ?"																															
" Yes, the room was smaller than we Americans are used to and expect, but was about average in size for European hotels ."																															
" Yes, the rooms are small but most hotel rooms are small in Europe so this was not a surprise ."																															
" Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat ."																															
" You need your room key to active the elevator, which is a nice security touch, but the readers in one elevator in particular   were very sensitive and didn’t always work ."																															
" Your room key is also necessary to turn on the electricity, which some people here have complained about ."																															
",  Decor in room was a bit dated ."																															
",  Room was smaller than I thought it was going to be ."																															
",  very clean,  quiet,  bathrooms appear to have been updated recentlyThe hotel location is great ."																															
", but after I called room service it was promptly fixed ."																															
", We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !"																															
"00 to get a room, need to fill in a form, be careful when order newspapers, they charge you except priority club member, this is not mentioned anywhere on the form, and unacceptable considered it is normally included in many other four stars hotels, paid £140 per night and they asked for another 65 pence for newspapers, cheapskate !"																															
00 US dollars per night and previously requested a room with 3 beds as we are 3 males who wanted our own beds and I was prepared to pay for the upgrade .																															
"00am the room was ready for us so we could take a nap to get over the jet lag and head out for an afternoon   evening of sight, seeing so we didn't lose any time due to the time difference ."																															
"15, after a lot of searching on the computer and a long wait, we were informed our family room was not ready would we take a seat and we would be called when it was available ."																															
"2,  When I tried to check in 2 days later they simply gave me a single bed room where my reservation was a twin bed room when they corrected it   I went to my room it was a smoking room   I had to go back to change it they said there is no rooms available   I have to sleep the night   they will transfer me in the next day like it was my fault  !"																															
30 to find our room was ready and the receptionist very helpful and friendly and my special requests had been noted and acted on .																															
"90 otherwise if you pay in The Forum room on the first floor until we'd been there a day or two  slightly patchy face cloth supply, the one time no, one in maintenance or reception would answer the phone, and the biggie ,  despite the warmest London autumn on record, the a c was switched off   and the room was always too hot ."																															
"Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times ."																															
"after returning from our dinner the staff had left a bottle of wine in the room and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, such a lovely touch !"																															
All in all a great place to stay for a getaway break in london try and a room on a higher floor overlooking the city it is worth it !																															
"Although smaller rooms are expected in Europe, the room with 3 beds in this hotel is considerably smaller than most standard size US hotel rooms ."																															
An ok Hotel if you get a room at a discounted rate .																															
"Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than I'd expected ."																															
"b basis Hotel huge ,  900 rooms Buffet breakfast good for a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again"																															
Bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .																															
Bedrooms were fine for what was needed   and when a feather pillow was requested I was greeted with a friendly confirmation it was on its way .																															
Booked this room via Lastminute's Secret hotels and is described as an awesome Kensington hotel .																															
"But the room is as I have previously mentioned rather small ,  see the photos, literally just enough room to walk between the bed and the dressing table desk, but so long as you are not intending to spend much time in there you will be OK ."																															
"com 'Mystery hotels' Reception staff freinedly and helpful, requested a quiet room and were given a room on the 17th floor facing the rear of the hotel which was about as quiet as you can expect for central london !"																															
"Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !"																															
"face it, London is very expensive, and rooms are not up to US standards  This hotel is PERFECT for the American that wants a clean, comfortable, reliable room without spending a fortune ."																															
"First, we walked in and the restroom door was broken ."																															
"For our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate ,  the location was good and the room was clean and quiet ."																															
"From the time we booked Holiday Inn Forum Kensington I was overcharged some 200 GBP on the fee I was quoted and had some considerable trouble getting this rectified by Holiday Inns central booking officeWhen arriving at hotel in room safe   bar fridge as quoted were not supplied   when I questioned reception they said can't supply a safe but will send fridge up which they did, but for all the good it was with fixed thermostat the drinks we put in it would have stayed cooler outside the fridge ."																															
"Furthermore, one of the room given was occupied by someone else and we could not open one room with the key given ."																															
"Had requested a double room, not available at time of booking and no notes in the reservation about this but we could have had a double if we had wanted to wait ."																															
I also got a phone call in the room on the second day from a strange man asking if I had found an ear ring which was lost that day in my room .																															
"I appreciate that we had a large room so it's difficult for me to comment on comfort of the standard room's, however, the mentality we have is we'd rather spend time exploring, so the size of the room isn't necessarily important ."																															
"I arrived early and the room was not ready, so I took a big bus tour   ."																															
"I got a good deal on this stay ,  2 nights for 123 pounds room only, through the priority club  , as I was coming to stay to go to a concert celebrate my daughters 16th Birthday ."																															
"I suppose it was just about OK but given that I booked relatively late and it cost me £125 room only, I thought it was not worth the money ."																															
If you want a simple and extremely small room then this is the place .																															
"I'll pass on a few minor issues and tips,  our room appeared to be below a disco ."																															
"In conclusion, rooms were small but clean, internet charge was expensive   and reception staff booking system was hopeless ."																															
"Let me just say that the bed was king size, but the room was tiny and the bed took up most of it ."																															
My husband and I stayed in a double room for six nights this month at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .																															
"My room was good size for European standards, and had recently been overhauled and included hair dryer, fridge, and air conditioning ."																															
"Nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all VERY noisy ."

We had an executive room and was disappointed to find that the extra bed was not done up and we had to call housekeeping to fold down the metal bed .																															
We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .																															
We were able to find an internet deal and got a double room for about 100€ night   and I'd definitely suggest you to immediately book this hotel if you're lucky to find some similar offer .																															
"Well, upon checkin, I was told no room was available as  they had been full the night before  so I would have to wait ."																															
"When i checked in, i asked to be shown several rooms and the staff was happy to do so ."																															
"When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available ."																															
 All on the way from Milwaukee I was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .																															
 Alot of the common areas that I enjoyed so much   have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms .																															
 as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .																															
 At this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and I would be stranded in Chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel .																															
" Building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor, so very quiet and no hall noise ."																															
 But I guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .																															
 But the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .																															
 But we really did spend very little time in our rooms .																															
" Contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice ."																															
 Expensive Parking but great rooms .																															
" For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds ."																															
 from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .																															
" From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !"																															
" Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet ."																															
 Had to move rooms and floors .																															
 He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .																															
" Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !"																															
 Hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfy .																															
" Hotel's architecture is nice, location near all point of interets and rooms are large, clean, quiet ."																															
 I called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .																															
 I called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms .																															
" I ended up with a double on the 7th floor ,  I would've preferred a King since I was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so I decided to keep it ."																															
" I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds ."																															
 I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .																															
 I recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .																															
 I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the rooms .																															
 In fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks !																															
" In our case, it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience ."																															
" It could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks ."																															
" It does suffer, however, from a trend that I have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded ,  particularly with a patch panel for the big LCD, TV ,  drawer space becomes less and less ."																															
" It is true that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem ."																															
 It seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .																															
" It was a good hotel, the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down ."																															
" I've olny ever stayed in the 'standard' rooms in this property, all of which are spacious and airy, and function well for both business or leisure travellers ."																															
 Large clean rooms and comfortable bed .																															
 Locker rooms were clean and had a sauna .																															
" Most importantly, the rooms were quiet ."																															
" My son loved the Chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean ."																															
" no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor ."																															
 Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .																															
 Our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .																															
 Our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old .																															
 Pool is nice with whirlpool and saunas in the locker rooms .																															
" Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier,   ."																															
" Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby ."																															
" Rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel ."																															
" Rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed ."																															
 Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .																															
" Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 ."																															
 Rooms in this hotel are noisy though .																															
" Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier ."																															
" Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views ."																															
 Rooms were nicely furnished .																															
" Rooms were very comfortable and spacious with nice furniture, comfy bed, luxurious bathroom, great TV, etc ."																															
 Since we were staying during busy Memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .																															
" So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it ."																															
" So, while the rooms are very nice, I will never stay at a Swissotel again, in any city ."																															
 Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don’t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .																															
" Strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms ."																															
" Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels ."																															
" Thanks to TravelZoo I was able to find an amazing deal ,  lakeside rooms for $129 night as part of a spring promotion ."																															
" The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude ."																															
" The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well ."																															
" The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years ."																															
 The Fairmont and Hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .																															
" The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel ."																															
" The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy ."																															
" The hotel looks like an office tower, the rooms look like converted boardrooms and the place has all of the charm of a Fortune 500 executive suite ."																															
" The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to ."																															
 The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .																															
" The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   ."																															
" The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile, and views from most rooms very good ."																															
" The recent renovation is great , ,  the guest rooms are really nice ."																															
 The room was huge as hotel rooms go .																															
 The room was two rooms from the elevators and I could still hear them but it wasn't too bad .																															
 The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .																															
 The rooms are bright and airy with wonderful beds and bedding .																															
" The rooms are business, oriented, so they are not as hip or stylish as, say, the Sutton Place or the W ."																															
" The rooms are in pretty shabby condition, but they are clean ."																															
" The rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !"																															
" The rooms are large, the view was wonderful overlooking Navy Pier ."																															
 The rooms are not all that big .																															
" The rooms are spacious and have nice views, I was NOT impressed with the mattress and every, little, tiny thing costs money ."																															
" The rooms are spacious and I've never had any problems with noise,  they are much quieter than other hotels I've been at ."																															
" The rooms are spacious and pristine with pillow, top beds that made it almost impossible to get up in the morning because it was so comfortable ."																															
" The rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious and up, to, date ."																															
" The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !"																															
" The rooms are very nice, well, appointed, with comfortable beds ."																															
" The rooms look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an HD TV and a nice iHome docking station to put my iPod so I could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio ."																															
 The rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible .																															
 The rooms were clean and modern .																															
" The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk ."																															
" The rooms were great, the staff was excellent ."																															
 The rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .																															
 The rooms were small and much more expensive .

" the standard rooms are small, the lobby bar is very small   ."																															
" The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding ."																															
" The view from the rooms is of the river and city, Lake Michigan or of Millennium Park ."																															
" The views are fabulous, the rooms clean and roomy ."																															
" The views were amazing, the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever I had a question ."																															
" Then again, the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it ."																															
" Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking ."																															
" There is simply no better way to experience the 4th of July in Chicago, than in one of the corner rooms with a view of Navy Pier ."																															
 There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .																															
" There's also an indoor pool, large excercize room, and spacious men's and women's locker rooms on the top floor with floor, to, ceiling windows all around you ."																															
 These rooms are right next to the elevators .																															
 These rooms are very speceous and the beds are very comfortable .																															
" They didn't charge us for the room, , , , but, also did not offer any type of compensation to the woman who arranged these rooms in FEBRUARY ."																															
 They have just recently upgraded the hotel rooms and they are wonderful .																															
" This time, no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one, bedroom, 1 ."																															
" very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable ."																															
 Very pretty rooms with an European flair .																															
" Very well equiped, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with every thing you need ."																															
" We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately ."																															
 We even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward Michigan Ave and the Wrigley building .																															
 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .																															
" We showed them our Wyndham By, Request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a complimentary upgrade to a conceirge level room ,  not both rooms but one room ."																															
 We stayed in two rooms on the 22 floor in August with our two teenage daughters .																															
 We were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly .																															
" When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later   ."																															
" While the rooms are a bit dated, the location is great ."																															
" While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago ."																															
 Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?																															
" word to the wise, , avoid the rooms ending with 11 ."																															
 You can see downtown and or the Navy Pier from most of the rooms .																															
Great Hotel with Great Rooms .																															
Great location but rooms need some work .																															
Great Location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .																															
Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !																															
Great rooms staff and location but extras overpriced .																															
"I called in a few hours before check in time to see if any rooms were available for check, in, the operator connected me to the reservations desk ."																															
I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .																															
I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .																															
I’ve stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but unremarkable .																															
Large rooms and excellent service .																															
One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .																															
"The bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great ."																															
The hotel and rooms were very clean .																															
the other two rooms were not clean .																															
"The rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid ."																															
"The rooms were nice, clean and updated ."																															
"The rooms were sleek and cool ,  great views ."																															
"The rooms with the Navy Pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level, Currents, was an excellent dining experience ."																															
"the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !"																															
The Swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .																															
"The view from the rooms was fantastic,My daughters are allergic to feathers and all trace of them were removed from the room as soon as we advised housekeeping ."																															
Very impressed with rooms and view !																															
"We   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms ."																															
" A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in, besides we didn't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco ."																															
" A warm welcome on arrival and a nice suite although the rooms were quite compact, however I understand this is common in Fishermans Wharf  ."																															
" Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non, smoking but I agreed to go and look ."																															
" Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street – not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk ."																															
" Also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available ."																															
" Although the rooms are not huge, our room was still easily big enough for 2 adults and a child   ."																															
																															
" Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly ."																															
" Although we arrived after 3pm, rooms were not ready and we were asked to wait ."																															
 Am sorry for those few noisey rooms that some folks got saddled with .																															
 And value is key for the rooms and the service !																															
" Another odd thing we noticed is a majority of the room doors opened OUT into the hallway, rather than into the rooms ."																															
 Apparently the inner rooms have the wall units .																															
" Apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted ."																															
 As previous reports suggest the rooms are a bit smaller than some other hotels we have stayed at but we were only there to sleep .																															
" Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides ."																															
" Asked next morning ,  still told we couldn't empty them ,  offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they didn't want to see it ,  they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and didn't know why BW advertised that they did ."																															
 Be sure to ask not to be put in the rooms right above the driveway entry .																															
" Beware, if you request adjoining rooms, they are not guaranteed and really not even planned ."																															
 Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms .																															
" But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king ."																															
" Check in was good, rooms both ready, and we upgraded with no problems ."																															
" Clean and well, appointed rooms were a bit smallish for a family of four,  , but as one previous reviewer indicated, we spent most of our time out and about ."																															
" Contrary to the comments of a previous reviewer, I never saw the rooms advertised anywhere as having 2 queen beds !"																															
 Couryard rooms are darker than street rooms .																															
" Currently   they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9 :"																															
 different rates for their rooms .																															
" Extremely comfortable rooms, with minibar, TV, alarm clock, ironing board and iron, moring newspaper ."																															
 Free internet in the lobby but none of any sort in the rooms .																															
 Great clean rooms with a fantastic shower !																															
" Had read some reviews about small rooms ,  but what do you need the extra space for ?"																															
" I agree with other reviews that the rooms were on the smaller side, but we thought the hotel was great overall ."																															
" I agree with other travelers that the rooms are small, and the street noise is sometimes annoying ."																															
" I am so dispapointed that I can't remember what room # it was becasue apparantly after reading other reviews, there are some newer and nicer rooms ."																															
 I asked the desk clerk when we checked in if the rooms were as small as they said they were in the reviews .																															
 I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms .																															
" I did have to search through the usual online websites to find the best deal for rooms, but if you take time to look, I think you will be happy with the rates you get ."																															
 I loved the shampoo and soap in the rooms .																															
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .																															
" I reserved two rooms, one for my son and his girlfriend, and one for myself ."																															
" I suggest you request a room facing the courtyard even numbered rooms, I think ?"																															
 I thought the rooms were good .																															
" I was surprised by the size of it, because we've stayed in other hotel rooms in large cities and the rooms were always tiny ."																															
 I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms .																															
" I would recommend this hotel as a good base for a short break to San Fran ,  the hotel rooms weren't the biggest so a longer stay might not be as enjoyable"																															
 If all the rooms are as small I would not want to stay for a long time .																															
 I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients .																															
" In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian décor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn’t really stretch to “European, style Boutique Hotel” ."																															
" It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour ."																															
" It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus ."																															
" It is in a great location, the staff is always alert and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !"																															
" It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly ."																															
" It seems to be an older hotel, with the resulting small rooms, but is very attractive ."																															
" It was actually two rooms, with a sofa bed, desk, coffee table, and television in the first room, and a bed, dresser, and television in a seperate room ."																															
" It was pretty small, so I'm sure the standard rooms are even smaller !"																															
 It's just 2 tiny rooms with a king bed in one and a pullout sofa in the other with a connecting door .																															
" location, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and comfy beds ."																															
" More intimate, close personal attention from the staff and exceptionally clean rooms ."																															
" My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms ."																															
" Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again ."																															
 Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .																															
" Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel ."																															
" Not the best place to be with kids, , smallish rooms, overpriced restaurant   and no pool, but I would stay there again if it were only the 2 of us ."																															
 older hotel with smaller rooms but updated nicely .																															
 One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in .																															
" Our rooms faced the street rather than the courtyard and the traffic ,  especially the motorcycles ,  were loud all night long ."																															
" Our rooms were of adequate size, very clean and as requested overlooking the courtyard area, which was very pretty ."

 We had street side rooms and all night long there were busses and loud noises so no one got good sleep .																															
 We have 4 children and we booked two adjoining rooms .																															
" We have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large ."																															
 We joked about the rooms being sound proof since we never heard other guests and we slept great .																															
 We made our reservations several months ahead of time and requested two adjacent double rooms as my husband and I were travelling with our two teenage daughters .																															
 We never heard a sound from other rooms besides the door next to ours opening and closing .																															
 We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms .																															
" We took just one room for that night and they moved us to adjacent, though not connecting, rooms the next two nights ."																															
" We were both delighted with the friendly staff, clean rooms and very convenient location ."																															
 We were five people with two rooms .																															
" Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated ,  guess they forgot our 2 rooms ,  kind of shabby ."																															
" We'd seen some reviews saying the rooms that face the street are noisy, so by asking for a room off the street, we got a very quiet room ."																															
 We've gone many places and made this request and this hotel is the first one that did not put us within a couple rooms of each other .																															
" While some have commented that the rooms are small at the Tuscan, that was not an issue for us ."																															
" While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect ."																															
" While this was an older hotel, it has been kept up well and the rooms were satisfactory ."																															
" Why they promise two rooms with a courtyard view, when they don't even have one to offer is beyond me ."																															
" Yes, the courtyard rooms are dark, but we weren't there much during the day anyway ."																															
" Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us ."																															
" Yes, the rooms were small for the money paid but the location was wonderful ."																															
", Get in inside room facing courtyard if you are light sleeper as outside rooms face the streets ."																															
"00am because our ventilation started clicking non, stop, , repair person came, suggested we just move rooms ."																															
40 and my rooms were not even ready .																															
"A wonderful stay, staff especially friendly, complimentary wine tasting a definite plus, rooms well appointed and well kept ."																															
"Apart from that, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable ."																															
Arrived before check in and was told that two courtyard rooms were reserved for my party and available at 3 :																															
"Booked two rooms on Priceline for $139 each, just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning ."																															
"BUT ,  the external facing rooms can be noisy from traffic, so make sure you request an internal room, facing the courtyard ."																															
"Downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms ."																															
Excellent location friendly staff clean and pleasant rooms																															
Good Location Small Rooms Some charm																															
"Got to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great ."																															
"Great Location ,  Nice   Rooms ,  Helpless Concierge"																															
Great location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .																															
"Great place to stay ,  very clean and confortable rooms and helpful staff ."																															
Great rooms  great staff  great hotel																															
great rooms fantastic location and great service !																															
I don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever .																															
"I feared the room size because of the other reviews, but I think we got lucky and received one of their larger rooms ."																															
"I was forwarned to expect small rooms, but I thought the Tuscan Inn had rooms typical or even generous for an urban hotel , exceeded my expectations ."																															
"I'm not sure why so many people say the rooms are small here, but our standard king size bed room was huge in my opinion ."																															
"My family stayed at the Tuscan Inn April 20, 25 in two connecting rooms ."																															
"My husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in march, I was concermed by the number of comments regarding the size of the rooms ,  yes they are a little on the small size but as there was only 2 of us plus my toddler daughter we found them to be more than adequate and very family friendly particularly liked the lock on the mini bar fridge door which housed a seemlessly endless supply of candy !"																															
Our family of five stayed in two rooms at the Tuscan Inn for two nights during the first week in January .																															
"Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side ."																															
pthe only negative thing's i will say is that the coffee maker in the room is a dreadfull waste of space and thee coffee pods and i stick of sugar and 2 pouches of milk a day is ridiculas there are no tea coffee making facilitys in the rooms to be honest as the coffee maker is just plain crazy .																															
Really enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and the big rooms .																															
"Small rooms, we could barely fit two adults and two children in the room ."																															
"Stayed for two nights, there were six of us in three rooms ."																															
"the beds are great, several good pillows and the rooms are super ."																															
"The hotel is newly decorated and rooms are a nice size, extremely new and clean ."																															
The hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms .																															
The location  the rooms  the staff  the concierge  the Managers nightly wine reception    everything about this hotel made our holiday MAGIC .																															
"The only other negative and its a small one, was the size of the rooms,they are tiny but were cleaned well and were ready when we returned every day ."																															
The pics of the rooms are the same as they present them online .																															
"The rooms and building are quite nice ,  location is excellent ."																															
The rooms are clean and comfortable although mine   could have been bigger .																															
"The rooms are pretty standard size, were nice and clean, and comfortable ."																															
"The rooms are very clean, spacious and quiet   ."																															
The rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .																															
"The rooms were clean and well appointed ,  the maid staff were excellent ."																															
"The rooms were freshly and creatively decorated, and meticulously clean ."																															
"The rooms were smallish and could get a little damp if you didn't keep the air conditioning unit on, but the beds were comfortable, and the courtyard, view room we had was very quiet ."																															
The rooms were tiny and still decorated in the 70s style .																															
"The travel agent booked this hotel and this was the only hotel out of 10 that I did not book myself although hotel sounded ok This was part of the deal for the airfares  Location is excellent , Rooms Ok Staff variable some very helpful others not so  ."																															
"This hotel offers clean, well, kept rooms which are good value for money ."																															
"Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again"																															
"Very cleanSmall rooms, but have a couch, chair, desk, etc ."																															
"Very comfortable beds and rooms ,  nice decor !"																															
"We arrive early and while they were not able to give us 2 rooms right away, they gave us one right away ."																															
We arrived from LA having paid the rooms in advance but were immediately hit by a $40 day surcharge to park our car .																															
"we found a friendly staff through out the hotel great location,rooms were small but as pointed out to me all land is prime in the area and all places have small rooms ."																															
"We had booked two connecting rooms since we were travelling with our boys, ages 11   15, and I called several days prior to arriving to remind them of our request ."																															
"We stayed here for 2 nights, the rooms are lovely, very clean, modern, and comfy !"																															
"we were there to see the city, not hang out in our hotel rooms !"
