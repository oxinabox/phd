"  Itunes has an on, line store, where you may purchase and download music and videos which will install onto the ipod ."						" Video recorder only, cannot take just photos ."		 The video looks great and it's easy to use .	 the video quality is perfect .
  My daughter thinks that the video clarity is amazing and finds the built in speakers awesome .						 I find it weird that it will take video but not still pics .		" The video capability is incredible, and so easy to use ."	 The videos are so clear I just love it .
"  This is an easy to use item, but is slightly confusing to use when trying to review video clips ."						" The video camera is nice, just wish it could take stills ."			
  We have had portable video players for our children as our cars are not equipped with these devices .						 The only odd thing is that is has a video camera but doesn't have a single shot camera .			
" ,  I cannot figure out how to get the video I recorded on my Nano off to upload it to Facebook or You Tube ."						" Love the camera, but wish it had photo capabilities, rather than just video ."			
" A must, buy for everybody who loves music and video ."						" It will take video, but not pictures  ?"			
 All the neat little features and surprisingly good video camera !						" Yeah, that's typed correctly ,  video, but not pictures ."			
 And I just foundout you don't need the head phones in the iPod to listen to your music or videos !						" Secondly, the thing has the capability to record video, but won't take pictures ."			
" and the video quality is very good, and the sound quality is very good as well ."						 Seems kinda silly that they would go right to video and completely neglect photography .			
" As always, the video screen is sharp and bright ."						 It's just a shame it only takes video and not still photos .			
" As easy to use as any other iPod, and the video is good ."						 I do wish that it also took pictures as well as video though .			
" As for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, I think people are going to go into this and think maybe I can replace my old video, NO ."									
 Audio and video recording are a step above the competition .									
" Awesome features fm radio, video camara, pedometer and more  ."									
" But overall I love it ,  between the radio, speaker, microphone, video camera, effects, there are enough new features to justify buying a new nano ."									
" camera does only video, not pictures  Way better than 2nd gen nano ."									
 Camera has great video effects   .									
 Can't believe the picture quality and ease of video use !									
 Can't figure out how to review the video clips I record .									
" cant take pictures just videos, and u need the headphones given for the radio  good for just listening to music and for your car ."									
 chip so I bought the newest iPod video the day it came out .									
" Comes in different colors, make videos, and holds alot of music ."									
" Definitely easier to use than the IPod Touch, and the video camera feature is awesome ."									
 Don't really need video camera  eventhough we don't use the video that much the rest of the features are great .

 FM radio and a   video camera are pretty darn cool .

 Great for spot video if you do not have a camera availabe on hand .									
" Great new features in this iPod generation include voice recording, listening to radio, and even filming video ."									
" Great sound quality, love the video recording too  :"									
" great video quality, no ear buds required internal sound system sounds great  ."									
 Had the original iTouch but I was burglarized andwas waiting for the iTouch with video but can't wait any longer .									
 Hard to delete videos from the Nano device .									
 Hard to get videos onto computer  This was a purchase I made after I returned my Sony Walkman .									
" has bigger screen, video camera  ."									
 Has video camera and voice memo .									
 He has been using it consistently ever since and has nothing but praise for it and it's many options  loves the video cam and the music player recorder especially									
 He loves shooting video and then viewing it in  cyborg  mode or in sepia tones .									
 He was delighted as it had a video and camera which his original one did not have .									
" Holds tons of music, video, pics ."									
" However, the way it is designed, it is clumsy to hold while recording a video ."									
 I also like that videos can be watched on it as well as listening to it without the ear phones that is a really great feature .									
" I also wish the video camera had a pause on it, but it doesn't pause and starts with a new video everytime you stop it ."									
 I am learning to navigate the menu better that at first and love that fact that I can take a video .									
 I cannot figure out how to get the video I record off of the IPod .									
 i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color									
 I decided to get this iPod cause of the Memory and the Video Cam in the back .									
 I do like the video camera on it .									
 I had the iPod Video but it did not work with my new Nike									
" i hate itunes, but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes ."									
 I have an old 60GB ipod video that I use in my car and now I use this ipod for walking around campus and such .									
" I have the 5th gen iPod video, and this thing blows it away !"									
 I have used the video camera nd the sound is good considering and the picture is									
" I haven't found anything that is not so great  This is a multi use MP3 player with the ability to make videos, music and videos ."									
 I love how easy it is to download from ITunes and the fact I can also do video  .									
" I love the video camera it has on it, the pedometor is awesome to use and best of all I can listen to music on it when I'm doing other stuff on my computer when it might be slowed down when listening to music on it ."									
 I mean I do have my cell that takes pics and videos but I just love the picture video the NANO records .									
 I took it to class and decided to test it out and everyone was surprised by how good the video quality was .									
" I wish the video camera had a pause on it, but you can't pause ."									
" If you had other ipods with the feauture of puting videos, when you synch them, they don't appear"									
" I'm planning on hiking half, dome next year and this is much much more lightweight than the video camera I have so it will definitely be accompanying me !"									
 I'm really disappointed that Apple is so proprietary that you can't use anything but iTunes to add music and videos to an iPod .									
" It can hold tons of music, video, pics and watching movies on the plane is nice ."									
 It does have some nice features such as the video camera and the radio .									
" It does so many things,  Wow, nav, video, mp3, and more !"									
 It eve ncame out better than a video she took with an actual camera camera !									
" It has a built in video camera, and it shoots in high quality, which I was surprised at ."

" It takes video and has a really cool radio feature on it, according to the kids ."									
" It was fine quality sounds for  roof, raising  music and also insane levels of clearity for music videos or movies on the go !"

" it would be nice to delete songs when they get old  the video camera is the best, i use it all the time ."

" Not a tremendous surprise here, as we believed the sixth, generation  true video iPod  would not be announced until later in the year or even early in 2007 ."									
" NOTHING  Ipod nano has a VIDEO CAMERA it is so cool, ROCK"									
 nothing  The functionality and video camera were great innovations added to the newest generation of Ipod !									
" Nothing  What will Apple think of next for their Nano, the video camara records awesome video even in dim lighting ."									
" Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature ."									
 Plenty of memory to add all your favorte music and videos .									
" She didn't want the touch, she wanted the nano because you can video, it has the radio that she can play back the songs and she likes the size ."									
 She loves to make her own videos and play them back .

" Still to new to we'll see  Great product, video feature is awesome and I love how there is now internal sound and you don't have to use ear buds with it ."									
" Still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the Zune HD   or iPod Touch ."									
" That way you will have enough storage to add music, video and pictures !"									
 The 16g holds a lot of music and video .									
 The 80GB is enticing for video addicts both for the capacity iTunes movies are about 1 .									
 The battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .									
 The camera and video feature are wonderful .									
" The color, the video, overall the item is great  ."									
" The colors are awesome, the sound is great and it hold tons of songs and videos !"									
" the glossy fingerprint attracting finish compared to last year's beautiful matte finish  Great improvements with the video camera, really fun special effects, easy to use ,  also great FM radio with pause feature ."									
" The mic and camera are great, speaker is great for video playback or bedtime movie watching, the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but Lighter than the 4th gen nano !"									
 The one problem with the video camera is it is not the easiest thing to use .									
 the picture for the video is awesome its very clear and easy to see .									
 The product is very useful if you want to go out for a jog and listen to your music or watch some videos if you stuck on a bus or subway .									
 The size is very nice and compact and the videos are beautiful !									
 The video and external speaker components were a surprise on the 5th Gen iPod .

" The videos are very crisp and clean, the video camera is nice, I was very surprised with the quality ."									
" The videos you record do not show up on iTunes though, you have to go to My Computer and find the ipod drive, then open the folder named DCIM, and the video files are in  ."									
 This can record videos and it is also Very Very Light Weight !									
" This time around, Apple is branching out of its iPod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the Nano with its own video camera ."									
 video camera built in and music plays without head phones  .									
 Video camera function and the blending of songs at the end and beginning  .									
 Video camera quality and sound are also surprising for such a small unit .									
" Video Camera with fun special effects, FM radio  ."									
" Video camera, FM turner, Speaker, Pedometer  ."									
" video camera, radio, great price for a 16 gig, not a fingerprint magnet, small ."									
" Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies ."									
 Video option is easy to use .									
 Video quality is better than I expected .									
 Video taking feature is interesting .									
" Video, even in low light, is impressive ."									
 Watching any videos drains the battery very quickly .									
" We haven't tried the video yet, so I can't comment on that ."									
" When you're not in a game or watching a video, if you turn it on the side, coverflow displays, however you can turn this feature off ."									
 Which I am sure all Nano's are like that  LOL The video camera is so much fun !									
" While the Nano allows for video and audio, the IPod touch has interactivity and"									
" While the Nano allows for video and audio, the IPod touch has interactivity and"									
" wish BB could engrave them too  announcer for songs is kind of annoying  Haven't yet tried the video, but very pleased with the size and quality of my music on this nano ."									
"5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   ."									
7 out of 10 have not used video yet but the pixels would be just the same .									
Amazing amount of music photos videos can be stored .									
"Great for music, just OK for video"									
Great little audio video device									
Great video camera and the funcionality is awesome

It's great to have a decent video camera with you at all times if you don't have an iphone .									
its really good up to apples usual standard sound quality and video quality is brillant and is ideal for anyone !									
My wife and I are really pleased with our Nano Ipods that we purchased from you so easy to use and good to have a camera as well as a video John Coleman									
"Our 12 year old loves the IPod ,  especially the video camera feature ."									
she was quickly able to download music and videos xmas am									
"shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp !"									
"So, the only thing about the iPod nano that I don't like   is the placement of the video camera ."									
The seller advertised it as the NEWEST model which should be able to take pictures and video .									
"The user interface of the 5G Nano remains almost entirely unchanged with the exception of a few new menu items for the video camera, FM radio, and fitness features ."									
The video camera feature is nice but I don't understand why they didn't allow for picture taking ?									
The video is surprisingly good !									
"then it would be perfect oh and make a 32 or 64gb version so I can fit all my music and have lots of room for video ,  thanks !"									
There's a right way and wrong way to store music and videos onto the ipod .
