" A clip, on light seems like a fine solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery ."																",  The battery life seems fine to me ."	 The battery life is unbelievable too .	 I've left the wireless on and really don't see tremendous battery usage yet .	 I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .
" A single battery charge of my Kindle lasts almost two weeks compared to the 3, 4 hours on my iphone or the 5, 6 hours on my netbook ."																Battery life is pretty spot on .	 The battery life seems amazing .	" Battery life is very good, even with the wireless on constantly ."	"Turn wireless OFF ,  It saves your battery ."
" After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   ."																	 And the long battery life is amazing !		">> Better battery life, FAR better with wireless function on ."
 After I plugged it in to my USB hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !																			"Oh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours ."
" After you have paged tru a 500, page book one, page, at, a, time to get from Chapter 2 to Chapter 15, see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there !"																			
" Also, I only carried my kindle on the plane to Japan, and I could read for over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over ."																			
" And I like the fact the wireless is a menu option, I just leave it on all the time anyways with little perceptible battery drain ."																			
" Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them ."																			
"The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me ."																			
" And the battery life has gotten a lot shorter too, again, after TONS of use ."																			
 The battery in the Kindle 2 is not removable by the owner .																			
"So my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace ."																			
 And the lack of backlight saves on the battery .																			
" By the way, Kindle battery lasts forever indeed !"																			
" Apparently the Kindle 1 had a battery the owner could replace quickly, the way a cell phone does ."																			
" As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus ."																			
" Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price ."																			
" Besides, I don't want to make the tradeoff of inferior battery life in order to power a device, native backlight ."																			
" extended use of this feature will cut into battery life significantly, I've been getting 2 ."																			
" For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !"																			
" Good thing the nook boasts a removable back cover, because the store clerk had to take it off to remove the battery for a hard restart ."																			
 However I have IPods and I never use up all the memory or battery life .																			
 I can do without the K2 several years from now for a week while the battery gets replaced .																			
 I can leave it on sleep for days and hardly ever need to recharge the battery .																			
 I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .																			
" I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full ."																			
" I turned it on, noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing ."																			
" If I didn't have a reading lamp handy, I find that the  Mighty Bright  clip on battery operated book light that amazon ."																			
" If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either ."																			
 It is so subtle that you can't tell how much battery life is left .																			
 It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .																			
" It's not clear how big an advantage it is to have the extra battery life, though, because both get you through a long day with power to spare ."																			
" K2 goes into sleep mode if you leave it be for a few minutes, but in this mode it still uses battery power if wireless is enabled ."																			
 Many have been critical of the non user replaceability of the battery .																			
" More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !"																			
 No idea what battery life is like because I just gave it to her .																			
" NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, , Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 ."																			
 Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .																			
 Plus the touch screen consumes battery life .																			
" So far, it has taken anywhere from two to three hours to recharge the device, depending on how far down I've let the battery run ."																			
 The 2 days battery life was with the wireless turned ON which is wholly unneccesary in the normal operation of the device .																			
" The battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours ."																			
" The battery life is disappointing ,  with the wireless on, it probably wouldn't last 20 hours of determined reading ."																			
 The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .																			
 The battery was almost fully charged upon receipt so I turned it on and I was in business .																			
" The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off ."																			
" The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel ."																			
" the screen is small, and the battery doesn't last long enough to be used in the way I use books ."																			
" The Sony is smaller and thinner and, I think, has longer battery life ."																			
 The Sony takes 60 seconds   to go back to the main menu and used an incrediable amount of battery .																			
 Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .																			
" This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it ."																			
" To me, this is more important than a user, replaceable battery ."																			
" When that came in, it was also in the critical battery stage and this time the charge light would not even come on upon charging ."																			
" which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself ."																			
" While the Kindle 2 shows the title on the left as before and more readable, the battery life and network icons are in the place of the author's name ."																			
" With 2, 3 hours of reading per day, my Kindle battery has lasted me only 4 days ."																			
" You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing ."																			
",  Battery life is weeks at a time, even with constant use ."																			
",  Battery life seems a bit longer but the K1 was good too ."																			
">> It has a user, replaceable battery, though this is offset by improved life with the built, in Kindle 2 battery ."																			
3The battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .																			
"4,  I like that you can change the battery in the Nook and you can add a memory card ."																			
"A week ago, I ordered my Kindle 2 and when it was delivered, the battery was in critical stage and it would not power on ."																			
"At first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff ."																			
because the battery ran down .																			
"Fourth, your battery icon stinks ."																			
"I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived ."																			
I'm not pleased with the prospect of having to send the unit in to have the battery replaced when it finally fails and won't take or hold a charge .																			
"It came with battery uncharged, but it charged up as advertised in less than 3 hours ."																			
"Kindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,"																			
																			
"Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power ."																			
"So far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading ."																			
"So I give the Kindle 2 an A, minus, the minus because the battery isn't replaceable by the end user ."																			
"The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me ."																			
"The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable ."																			
The original Kindle had a removable battery and you could buy extra batteries in case you'd be away from a power source for an extended time .																			
"very thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,"																			
"What I'm ambivalent about ,  I don't find the battery life any better than the K1, I thought the K1 battery life was perfectly fine ."																			
would no doubt run down the Kindle 2's battery faster .
