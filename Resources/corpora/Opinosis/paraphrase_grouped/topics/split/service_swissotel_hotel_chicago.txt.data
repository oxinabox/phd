" $52 a night to park, read very carefully about the room service charges,swimming pool and internet charge in your room, and of course the mini bar ."					Excellent service and Awesome view .	Customer Service needs improvement .	front desk staff need customer service 101 .	 Exceptional rooms and service !
" A very nice, classic, comfortable, full, service hotel ."					Exceptional View and Fabulous Service .	 The customer service stinks .		" The room was nice, but the service was horriable ."
 A very recent survey mentioned that most high end hotels are no longer offering the service or will not in the near future .					Fabulous views  Amazing service !	 Could have had a bit nicer service .		
" Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !"						 Very disappointing from a service perspective .		
" Also, room service told me that I could not order scrambled eggs because it was after 11 AM ."								
" Also, they charge exorbitant prices for mini, bar items and room service meals, so be prepared for that ."								
 Although my key card always malfunctioned   the service was top notch .								
" Altogether a nice and modern business hotel with all kind of service, but nothing with individuality and charme ."								
" And to offer nothing to the woman who paid in advance and booked in advance, , , , , terrible customer service ."								
" As for service issues, the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley  the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels, despite a $3 tip that had been left I normally tip $1, 2 per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid, but I decided to try something different this time since we were at a 4"								
 Beautiful hotel with great service and location .								
 Bell Service was helpful in arranging a van cab to take us to the airport .								
 But the service just can’t be beat .								
" By the way, all housekeeping and room service requests are handled promptly ."								
" Chicago is fantastic and i would recommend giordinos pizza  , we also did the chicago bus co tour, we paid fpr a 3 day pass which was worth the money because it is a hop on and off service and can be used to save your legs when you start to get tired ."								
 Clean and comfortable with friendly service and a convenient Chicago location .								
" Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens !"								
" Concierge service from our experience was good from one but bad from another so if you don't get good help the first time you ask, just go ask again later when someone else is there ."								
" Even with the amount we saved on the room, we could not justify spending the amount they listed for room service ."								
" Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service ."								
" For the location and comfort of the new rooms, this is the perfect hotel, however come armed with your credit card as they appear to be funding the refurbishment through room service and mini bar charges, not to mention the room rates ."								
" Got Swissotel for a very good price, but was a little anxious since some of the reviews on this site complained of slow elevator service, unhelpful staff, etc ."								
" Great service in there, and a nice quiet place to grab a drink and just talk ."								
" Great service, nice view, nice room ."

" Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !"								
 I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .								
" I cannot comment on room services, however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful ."								
" I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge ."								
 I ended up ordering room service .								
 I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night .								
 I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view .								
 I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and room service .								
" I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay ."								
" I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do, not, disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned ."								
" I ordered room service late on Saturday night, and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago !"								
 I recommend this high class hotel with perfect service and will stay there again .								
 I won't be staying here again until I hear that they have upgraded this service .								
" I would recommend this hotel, they gave great service even though we booked with [, , ] ."								
" If you are interested in going to Navy Pier, there is a free trolley service on the side of the Hyatt hotel, you can catch, just make sure it has the yellow star on the trolley ."								
" In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center ."								
 Internet service worked fine with a $10 daily charge .								
 It amazes me that a hotel of this caliber does not understand customer service .								
 It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service .								
 Just don't ask anyone to provide you with outstanding service !								
 Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a 4 star hotel .								
 Lots of folks were checking out and the elevator service was slow .								
" Maid service, perfect no complaints ."								
 Mediocre room and service for a very extravagant price .								
" Mom didn’t want to walk too far at night, so after leaving Navy Pier   we came back to the room and I ordered room service for just the second time in my life ."								
" My family and I recently stayed in the Chicago hotel,   and I was so completely disappointed in both the room and the service that not only will I never stay in one of their facilities again, but I will certainly encourage all of my friends and family to do the same ."								
" My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services ."								
 My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service .								
 Never had a problem with any service personnel .								
 No greeting when you called them   and the service was fine but indifferent .								
" no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor ."								
" no robes in the rooms, ice machines are not on every floor  , no turn down service at night, and when housekeeping did come, they did not replace the shower gel we had used which was totally empty ."								
 Not sure why hotels don't seem to understand that their guests opinion of the hotel is influenced more by housekeeping services than it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .								
" Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers ."								
" On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services ."								
 One thing that really impressed us was the excellent housekeeping service .								
" One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby ."								
 Ordering soup on room service will set you back around $20 								
 Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel &amp  I felt the service and hotel were much better .								
" Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere ."								
" Overall, this hotel from top to bottom ,  service, furnishings, beds, appeal ,  is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn ."								
" potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff ."								
" Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery ."								
 Room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when I ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .								
 Room service is limited after 10 p .

 Service was excellent and the suites were large and comfortable .								
 Service was friendly and courteous .

 Service with a smile always !								
" So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it ."								
" Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful ."								
 Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service .								
" stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive ."								
 Swissotel needs some training on customer service .								
 The accomodations and support services are phenomenal .								
" The bell service at the front door was nice, opening the door of the cab when we arrived and always saying hello when we were entering or leaving the hotel but the reception and concierge service was not as polite, often making us feel like we were troubling them for recommendations or when asking about buses and maps ."								
 The concierge and service line were both just okay .								
" The elevators were always quick and in service, and the views of Navy Pier as you walk off the elevators are spectacular ."								
" The fitness center has good equipment, and room service arrives even faster than they predict in their estimates ."								
 The furniture was a little worn but the hotel's service and location made up for it .								
 The hotel charges for internet service .								
" The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food ."								
" The hotel is in a great location, the staff is friendly and very service, oriented ."								
 The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .								
 The internet access guest services movie selection didn't work either .								
" The internet service is reliable and fast, and the desk in the room is large ."								
" The last remark in fact goes for the whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated ."								
 The lunches are reasonably priced and the service is great .								
" The maid who had provided turn, down service had also turned on the radio, so &quot Take Five&quot  accompanied the fireworks ."								
 The Menu Prices for room service Forget it !								
" The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters ."								
 The person at the front desk said for room service to fill out the menu or go to the Palm restaurant and they would bill it to our room .								
 The room had not been serviced and we were not pleased .								
" The room itself had worn carpets, some scratched furniture and leaky showerhead, butthe maid service was generally prompt and efficient ."								
 The room service was a little expensive but very good .								
" The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !"								
" The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk ."								
" The rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !"								
 The service truly was above and beyond .								
 The service we experienced was top notch and everyone was extremely pleasant .								
" The staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel ."								
" The staff was wonderful, our room was very comfortable with an amazing view of the Chicago River and Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   ."								
" The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff ."								
" There is no actual Spa, its just a service they make an appointment with and they come to the hotel, , so the services are overpriced ."								
 There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water .								
" There’s a reason why it’s not the Holiday Inn and I’m assuming you stay there because of the amenities they offer and the service and location and views afforded and so no, you’re not going to pay corner diner prices at an upscale hotel ."								
" They did give us an extra bed for our little girl after we requested it but having stayed in the hampton inn and suites, milwaukee the days before, i have to say the service was poorer ."								
" They had a great wine list, appetizers, and friendly service ."								
" They had fantastic service there,  pricey, but so worth it ."								
 They have demonstrated a wonderful ability to deliver consistent service and go above and beyond .								
 This is a great hotel with no customer service focus .								
 This restaurant is within the hotel but seems to operate independantly so you cannot order room service from the Palm but you can get take out and then have plates utensils delivered from room srevice .								
" To use the gym or pool was a $15 a day charge, to print our boarding passes was a $6 dollar charge and internet service was a $9 a day charge ."								
" Too bad on several days, they were not able to service the room until late afternoon ."								
 We appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .								
" We could not have been more pleased with the service, location, as well as the room and its view ."								
 We didnt use the parking or the gym or the pool and they have technology to remember the guests name when you call the concierge or the guest service they will address you by name .								
 We don't use the concierge services or any of the other services unless there is a problem .								
 We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .								
" We had a tiny hiccup at first, , our room wasn't getting very cool despite putting the thermostat to 60F so I contacted guest services and they sent an engineer straightaway while we were sightseeing for the day ."								
" We had breakfast included with our hotel package and the buffet was very good and the service at Geneva was top notch, but I would never pay $26 for it ."

 We hired a babysitter through a great nanny service .								
 We ordered room service for breakfast and were not disappointed .								
 We ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food .								
" We spent last weekend at the Swissotel and were delighted with the service, the views and the amenities ."								
 We travel extensively and I can tell you that the scenario in Chicago could have been avoided had the manager taken any amount of time to use some form of customer service .								
 We were overcharged by $27 on a couple club sandwiches and drinks we ordered from room service .								
 We were very pleased with the hotel and with the service .								
" When you do find the ice, it is in a service area often cluttered with maid carts ."								
 While our lakeview room was spectacular   I was very disappointed with the room and the service at this hotel .								
" While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago ."								
" Why is it that a $69 motel serves free breakfasts, turns on the TV when you push power on the remote and has free internet service ."								
 You can get better customer service elsewhere for much less .								
" You'll pay hotel prices for breakfast, but the price was on par or slightly below breakfasts that we've had via room service at other hotels ."								
", followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p ."								
", with the tray charge, service charge and taxes making up the bulk of it ."								
00 through an online hotel booking service .								
"3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access ."								
"30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free ."								
"4 The restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests ."								
6 Make sure to sign up for the Club Swiss Gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade .								
"Beautiful Hotel ,  Service Slightly Lacking ."								
"Beautiful view and bathroom, , , , terrible service and overall management ."								
Breakfast perfect and service really good .								
"Close to everything ,  underground eating, Michigan avenue shops ,  walking or short cabNegatives,  Room service expensive ,  ridiculously expensiveParking expensive ,  $52 per dayFitness center cost $15 per day"								
com $200 per night but wish we had stayed with the hilton group for our stay in chicago s they seem to be more reasonably priced and more customer service based .								
Concierge service was fine when we needed our boarding pass printed .

great breakfast great view and great service .								
Great stay excellent housekeeping service .

The rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .								
"the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !"								
"Valet service is a joke,  takes forever to get the car, and then they stand right next to you until you tip them ."								
We found the service to be fine for our needs .								
We were disappointed that the internet service was not free .								
"While the Swissotel may not have the super high end service and ammenities   that some of the top tier hotels have, it is a very nice hotel that I would have no problems recommending to anyone ."
