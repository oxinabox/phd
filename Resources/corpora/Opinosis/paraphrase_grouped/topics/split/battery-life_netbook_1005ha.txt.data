 Battery life is over 8 hours and I plan to upgrade the memory soon .																		
" Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance ."

" I carry this netbook in my purse at all times, the long battery lasts as long as described ."																		
 I didn't time it but I got tired of waiting to run down the battery .																		
 I do imagine playing games on it would reduce the amount of time on the battery .																		
" I expected six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up ."																		
 I have been able to make the battery expectancy get up the reported 10 .																		
 I have found the actual battery life to be around 8 hours   .																		
 I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .																		
 I have not experienced the problems with the battery charger mentioned by other reviewers either .																		
 I have not tried running the battery out quickly or seeing if I can shut things down to get the full 10 .																		
" I have the $299 version from Best Buy, it has a 3 cell battery with 3hrs of battery operation ."

" I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design ."																		
 I read the reviews before I first bought this netbook and was aware that there was an issue with the battery .																		
 I say it's a small price to pay for a sleek and light computer with an incredible battery life .																		
" I spend a lot of time in battery, power environments for other technical devices, so I'm a bit more forgiving when it comes to expected battery life versus real battery life ."																		
" I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   ."																		
" I suppose if I turned off the WIFI and Bluetooth and did nothing more than use MS Word, the battery would last longer ."																		
" I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC ."

 I'm just glad that I didn't buy a machine with slightly less hours of battery life .																		
" In addition the ac adapter does get quite hot while it is actively charging the battery, which Asus clearly mentions in the user manual, so one should not be alarmed over the heat output ."																		
 Indeed it runs as fast as advertised and battery life is excellent .																		
" It also features a N270 cpu, 6, cell 48Wh Li, ion Battery 8 ."																		
" It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural ."																		
" It does not overheat and the battery lasts a long time, not 10 ."																		
" It has a solid feel to it  , but the battery juts out quite a bit, the touchpad keys are terribly placed, the webcam is only 0 ."																		
																		
" It has the fastest processor currently available  , huge battery, life 10 ."																		
" It is a big battery, and it does tend to tip backwards if fully opened and placed on a flat surface ."																		
" it is designed to be as small as possible, and the long, life battery on the back end makes it tipsy ."																		
" It looks good, is very sleek and stylish, very light and gives around 9, 10 hrs battery backup on 1 charge ."																		
" It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter ."																		
																		
" It's bigger, heavier, and has less battery life, but it is much easier to upgrade internal components ."																		
" I've had the machine for 2 weeks now and the only thing that I'm not very happy with is that the battery power, for me anyway, doesn't last 10 ."																		
 Keeps it nice and cool and doesn't have a significant effect on the battery .																		
" Key features in my decision were b,g, & n wireless, built in bluetooth mouse capability, and the best in class battery life ."																		
" Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability ."																		
 Love the LED backlight concept which saves battery life and you don't have to worry about the flourescent bulbs fading after a few years   .																		
" Much to my surprise I was shocked at how well it performed, especially the battery ."																		
" My 10, hour battery is now a 7 ."																		
 My charger battery has never had any problems .																		
" My computer exhibited the precise symptoms described by others, , the first charge, up went fine, but when I had depleted the battery and went to recharge it, the power supply failed to do anything ."																		
" My Jabra bluetooth headset works great with Skype, I've gotten 6 hours on my battery watching movies, listening to music   before plugging it back in ."																		
" My only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great ."																		
" Not to mention that as of now Asus will not sell you a spare 3 or 6, cell Li, Ion battery ."																		
" Noticed that the battery indicator started flashing orange, instead a steady orange ."																		
" Now add in the N, standard wireless, free netbook sleeve and the usual laptop microphone   webcam suite, and together with its aforementioned compactness and long battery life, it becomes possible to do productive work on the Asus Eee HA1005 ,  maintaining web sites, writing long articles, coding, e, networking, etc ,  almost anywhere ."																		
 Now I keep battery topped off or charge when not in use and no longer seems to be a problem .																		
" Obviously ,  the battery drained out within hours ."																		
 of battery life if you're using wifi & doing email word processing YouTube web surfing .																		
" Of course, without the adapter you can't charge the battery or operate the computer ."																		
" On top of that, ASUS tech support reports that the brick is out of stock and will not be available for 2 weeks and my battery is completely dead ."																		
 Our unit has operated flawlessly so far and the 10 hour battery is a real plus .																		
 Pretty standard list of specs for a netbook with the addition of bluetooth and a very long battery life .																		
 Realistic battery numbers are between 8 .																		
" Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it ."																		
" Regarding battery duration I cannot comment on its purpose since whenever I am doing word processing tasks, have always music or videos running ."																		
" Saying that, I don't have any battery saving settings set as I'm not too familiar with that and haven't had the need ."																		
" Seriously, I felt extravagant and almost guilty when he noted the 10 hour battery life on my Asus ."																		
" Since I have bluetooth and wi, fi on most of the time I actually get about 6~7 hours of battery life ."																		
" Since then, I've used it exclusively on battery power ."																		
 So I decided that whatever I buy has to have a removable battery .																		
" So I exchanged the bad netbook for a new one, but the new one is just like the first  the battery will not charge at all ."																		
" Some complainers faulted the battery life, but didn't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer ."																		
 Sometimes it says that I have 70% battery life AND 3hrs :																		
" Such much lighter and smaller, and compared to the Lenovo, its battery is immortal ."																		
 Sure this one has a larger battery .																		
" The 1008HA was not a consideration because of the non, removable battery and significantly shorter battery life ."																		
" The 1008ha you would have to ship into the Asus company to get a new battery upgrade for ram, which will cost something ."																		
" The 6, cell lithium, ion battery is seamless integrated into the mainframe to minimize space usage ."																		
 the AC charger just stopped charging the battery .																		
 The adapter that charges the battery overheats really easily .																		
 The advantages over Acer and HP are in the best battery and the magnificent instalation that comes with the computer .																		
 The Asus Eee PC is sleek and that big battery doesn't stick out on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .																		
" The backlighting is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life, but it also makes for a very nice bright picture ."																		
 The battery does not protrude and is removeable .																		
 The battery doesn't add much bulk to the overall unit at all either .																		
 The battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .																		
" The battery is INFINITELY better, and I can easily squeeze 10 hours out of it if I need to ."																		
" The battery is spectacular, and the key board didn't take any time getting used to, and of course it is a very cute cool little gadget ."																		
" The battery life is also great ,  I can charge my phone out of the usb port in class and not have to worry about running low on battery before the day is over ."																		
" The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness ."																		
 The battery life is plenty for me .																		
" The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10"																		
 The battery life last almost 4 hours with contine use but I have the battery charger that charges in no time .																		
" The battery life lasted me about a good 6, 7 hours of e, mail, internet, some MS office work, and watched a video or 2 from streaming Netflix ."																		
 The battery life on this thing really is 																		
 The battery life was the huge selling point for me and it is truly awesome .																		
 The battery life will ensure that i can go hours without needing a recharge .																		
 The battery power is as advertised which is a main reason I selected this netbook .																		
" The battery power is long lasting, and it serves me well throughout the day ."																		
																		
 The charger would not operate at all and the computer became useless once the onboard battery ran down .																		
																		
 The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .																		
 The first day I got it I used it for at least 7 hours and Windows still said it had an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .																		
 The image is nice and crisp and the longevity of the battery is a definite plus .																		
" The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features ."																		
" The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat ."																		
" The main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU ."																		
 The main selling point for this netbook is its amazing battery life .																		
 The only minor issue is that the battery life is a bit less after the Windows 7 upgrade .																		
 The seashell allows for a big battery .																		
 The sound wasn't all that great but hooking up some battery op speakers or headphones would be the way to go there .																		
 The trick is to fully charge and then fully discharge this battery several times before you start using it in the regular mode .																		
" The use of WIFI also seems to drain the battery, but just not as quickly ."																		
" The warranty card plainly states that the warranty covers everything but, the battery or free accessories such as mice or laptop bag ."																		
" The wireless networking logs on as soon as the unit is booted, I've had the charger plugged in while cycling the battery and the charger has not quit, the battery life has peaked to the point I can leave this thing on all day without it shutting down ."																		
 Then I switched to battery power and the machine froze .																		
" There are other machines out there, some with identical specs, some similiar, but none match the battery life ."																		
 They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .																		
" They said there are only so many recharges in the life of any battery, and when you don't have to use the battery, it extends its life ."																		
" This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted ."																		
" This isn't a hassle, and usually when you want extended battery life, you're on a plane where you don't need full brightness or radio anyway ."																		
" This thing has great battery life, fits in the glove box of my car, and serves the uses of a netbook in excellent fashion ."																		
" this thing shines, yet barely sips at the battery"																		
" To make a long story short, the track pad buttons   are a nightmare and the battery protruding on the bottom is an ugly compromise ."																		
" Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen ."																		
" Unboxed the netbook, put in the battery, charged it up, everything was great ."																		
" Using a USB mouse lessens the battery time but I LOVE it anyway, it fits into my purse, the colors are great and it is much quicker than my desk top ."																		
 Very lightweight and portable and the battery life is outstanding .																		
" What none of the reviews I read told me is that the Asus company recommends that when you are somewhere that has electricity, you should take out the battery and just plug in the machine ."																		
" When I found out about the Dell Mini 10v coming out, I ordered one with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive ."																		
" When I learned about the battery life, the memory, hard drive, processor, etc ."																		
 When I put back the factory memory the machine worked perfectly on A C and battery .																		
" When I read the specs and the reviews and the extra hour of battery life for just a few bucks more, my decision was revised ."																		
" When I recently started looking into purchasing a netbook, I was impressed with the battery life of the Asus Eee PC 1000HE ."																		
" When putting the battery on, it nearly doubles the weight of the computer ."																		
" When you start it up for the first time, leave it plugged in ONLY as long as it takes for the battery to charge to full ."																		
" While this is still a fine machine, battery life has started dropping off already ."																		
" With some tweeking, the battery indeed lasted over 10 hours, even while watching hours of  ."																		
" With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy ."																		
" With the very first charge, I got nearly 10 hours of battery life ."																		
" You have to physically shut, down, unplug, plus remove the battery ,  then restart ."																		
",  The best thing about this unit is the battery life ."																		
",  The long life battery makes this unit heavy ."																		
", around the house, i can freely roam to wherever i find comfortable or least noisy, NEVER having to worry about the power cord because of the seemingly infinite battery life ."																		
", Very sharp, clear image, even with brightness turned down low to get the most from the battery"																		
"0 out of 5 stars A great little machine, perfect for travels, though battery life bit shorter than advertised ."																		
"0 out of 5 stars Battery problem, August 10, 2009"																		
"0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations ."																		
0 out of 5 stars I wish I had listened to everyone with charging   AC   battery issues !																		
"0 out of 5 stars Initially battery problems , ,  however now it works, December 22, 2009"																		
"0 out of 5 stars netbook with power and battery life, August 24, 2009"																		
"0 out of 5 stars No issues at all, battery charger works fine ."																		
0 out of 5 stars Would have been 5 stars except for failed battery and failed ac adapter .																		
"1 FAIL ,  After one charge cycle, the battery blew a circuit, and would no longer power the netbook ."																		
"2 FAIL ,  After three charge cycles, the AC Adapter blew a circuit, and would no longer charge the battery ."																		
"3 megapixel camera, the n280 atom processor, a 6, cell battery, and much more ."																		
"3MP webcam, 6, Cell 63Wh Li, ion Battery with a whopping 10 ."																		
"4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover ."																		
"5 battery life was just a claim, but charged at %100 my battery life clocked in 10 ."																		
"5 hour battery claim, but it seems to be accurate ."																		
"5 hour battery is the real deal ,  I had my unit on for 10 hours and it was still running with just over 10% battery capacity remaining ."																		
"5 hour battery life is not true ,  if your doing anything other then nothing you will usualy get like 6, 7 hour battery"																		
"5 Hour Battery Life to anyone who was looking to make a netbook purchase  Asus seems to have gotten a poor reputation based on their customer service and the faulty power cords they've been sending out, but the netbook itself is a gem ."																		
5 Hour Battery Life was the one that caught my eye .																		
"5 Hour Battery Life, August 7, 2009"																		
5 hour battery pack and the 2 GB Crucial upgrade from Amazon after continued delays from Dell on my new Vostro 1520 notebook with Xp .																		
"5 Hour Battery, Glossy Display, Bluetooth, Netbook Sleeve"																		
"5 Hour Battery, Matted Display"																		
"5 Hour Battery, Matted Display"																		
5 hours from the battery  I usually get 7 .																		
"5 hours of battery life, bluetooth, a better webcam can someone confirm this ?"																		
5hr battery model is going to run a touch heavier than the 6 .																		
5hr battery models but the extra battery life is really worth it .																		
"6GHz 533FSB cpu, glossy display, 3, Cell 23Wh Li, ion Battery  , and a 1 ."																		
"9GHz, but it's unstable, and I have actually returned it to stock speeds since the battery life is much better at stock ."																		
"After 3 hrs the battery was fully charged, unplugged the netbook, started up Windows, and the battery indicator showed about 10 hours charge remaining ."																		
"After receiving it in the mail  , I plugged it into the outlet in the living room and allowed the battery to charge ."																		
"All in all, great product, great battery life ."																		
Battery is width of 10 pencils .																		
Battery life advertised at 10 .																		
Battery life is great and it seems to charge fast as well .																		
"Been very pleased with performance and battery life, however power supply went out after 60 days ."																		
"Charges fully and swiftly,long lasting battery time, functions beautifully ."																		
"Deciding between the V series and the P series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different  , a small battery life difference, a better web cam, Bluetooth, and or the netbook sleeve ."																		
"Eventually, I noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine ."																		
Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .																		
"For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics ."																		
Good battery life under Linux about 7 .																		
"Great battery life, very fast on my wireless router, does websites with flash and other media supported elements and even though I still love my Blackberry I needed something with a bit more  umph  to store vacation pics in on the road and attach files to email ."																		
I also noted the charger becomes extremely hot when plugged in and charging the computer battery .																		
I always dreamed of a PC that has very long battery life																		
I am a college student that got tired of lugging around a heavy 15inch laptop with less than 3 hours battery life .																		
I bought this although I already have a Sony Vaio for its light weight and long battery life .																		
I bought this back in early July and have had NO problems with my battery or charger .																		
"I bought this netbook and the AC adapter worked fine, but the battery wouldn't charge at all ."																		
"I bought this to use when traveling within a developing country, where I need lots of battery life and don't feel like lugging around my conspicuous   15  notebook ."																		
"I had a 2 year old dell that just gave me problems so often, and recently the warrenty went out, coincidentally the battery's connection malfunctioned so it had to stay plugged in and the internet could not be detected, while my parents laptops were fine ."																		
I have had the laptop for 3 weeks now and I have had no trouble with the battery life or the charging process .																		
"I like Eee 1005PA, V's battery life ."																		
I love this netbook so far I have not been able to run out of battery 10 .																		
"If someone is in the market for a great little traveling machine to access the internet, send receive emails, do some writing, and need extended battery life, I highly recommend this Asus eee netbook ."																		
"If the ratio of battery, life to cost is important to you ,  this is a decent netbook, except for the inevitable charger failure ."																		
If we don't get fax no battery .																		
"If you follow these instructions for several battery cycles, you should find that the charger eventually stops overheating ."																		
I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .																		
"In the mean time I let the battery go down completely  turned out the battery would not charge, even though Windows XP was reporting it was ."																		
It's incredibly light even with the battery pack in   .																		
I've run the machine on battery power some four or five times so far and have found no problems with charge or battery power life .																		
Luckily this thing has a great battery life our I'd be out of luck .																		
"My battery recharger failed within 24 hours, I returned it and received no notification that a replacement was shipped ."																		
"One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook ."																		
"One of the reasons I chose this netbook was that the battery does come out ,  my old laptop had an internal battery, and when it stopped taking a charge, I had to replace the whole machine ."																		
"Only problem was when I went to recharge my battery for the SECOND TIME EVER OWNING THIS NETBOOK, the power adapter wasn't working ."																		
"Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight ."																		
"Since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard ."																		
Some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .																		
space bar changes battery settings on the ASUS software .																		
"Terrific value at $324 , ,  especially considering the six cell battery !"																		
"The battery arrived pre, charged ."																		
																		
"The battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness ."																		
The battery life has not been tested in one complete sitting .																		
The battery life is pretty good though the trackpad is annoying .																		
"The battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up ."																		
The most impressive on this is the battery life :																		
The battery on my netbook lasts almost 13 hours since I keep the LCD brightness relatively low .																		
"The best part of the 1005HA is that the battery IS user, replaceable ."																		
The computer will rarely turn on even though the battery has plenty of charge in it .																		
"The laptop itself is great ,  nice crisp display, great battery life, light, and a nice form factor ."																		
The long battery life is on and off .																		
																		
"The reason I went with Asus is the long battery life without the huge bump in the back   ,  a fast processer, easy memory upgrade, good looks and great price ."																		
"The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   ."																		
This netbook has plenty of power for my needs and the battery life is great .																		
Well I first ordered this netbook through J&R Music for a good price and when it arrived I charged the battery fully and later turned it on .																		
what i loved is the battery  :																		
"when experiencing charging problems, let the battery go out completely ."																		
When might the battery arrive .																		
When received battery defective would not charge .																		
"While my 1005HA works like a charm, I personally know several folks that have experienced issues with the battery and or power supply ."																		
Will update when battery arrives in a few weeks .																		
With the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .																		
Within a few hours of owning this netbook the battery meter stopped working .																		
Won't send battery without fax letter of agreement .
