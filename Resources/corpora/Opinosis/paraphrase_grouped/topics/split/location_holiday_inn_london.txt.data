 The raves about the location are well deserved .												
 The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .												
 The rooms are a standard European size   but they are kept spotlessly clean and the hotel couldn't be in a better location .												
 The tube station is right there and the location is great for getting around London .												
" There was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location ."												
" This being our first ever visit to UK, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from Glousceter Rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, Piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a c of maintainence etc ."
