" There was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location ."																							
" This being our first ever visit to UK, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from Glousceter Rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, Piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a c of maintainence etc ."

"Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness ."																							
"Yes I do stay here a lot and as such, guess that I get extra special treatment but it is in a great location with the tube within a 2 min walk surrounded by places to eat and drink and far enough out of central London to be quiet but you can still be in the west end in 15 minutes ."
