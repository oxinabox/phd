"  The only downsize of this hotel I see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than £15 for full English breakfast or £10 if booked in advance ."						" Price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds night ."	Very happy with the hotel for the price .	Good hotel for the price nice location .	 Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !	 The quality was very good and the price was reasonable .
" ,  smallish roomsOld style bar pubNo ventilation on a smoking floorIt's not worth the hotel web, site price of £160 for STD room ."						" We got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find ."	 Overall for the price I think it was extremely good value .	" For the price and location, this was a very great hotel ."	 You could not beat the location or the price .	 A very good value for the price .
 All for the bargain price off £ 250 for 2 nights including return rail to North Wales .							 The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .	" All, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location ."	Price and location can't be beat .	 Hard to find better at this price .

 Although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price .							Excellent hotel excellent price .			
 Although this was about the same price as the local bars etc .							 We had terrific price per room and seems hard to beat .			
" and fully intend to come back again ,  if the price is right ."										
" Anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in London, but for the price location we would   visit again ."										
" As previous reviewers have said, there's a variety of shops nearby   and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there ."										
" Breakfast is ok, but not worth paying for if it's not included in your room price ."										
" Breakfast was appalling, plenty of it, you certainly won’t starve, but the quality was awful considering the price paid ."										
" But again, the location could justify charging that price ."										
 But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .										
 Can't beat the price of $75 per night through Priceline .										
" Considering the horrible exchange rate GBP USD at the time we were in London, I believe the price was fair ."										
" Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough ."										
" Don't buy the bottled water from the hotel ,  go to the supermarket and get it for half the price !"										
 Even though this price doesn't include breakfast it was still a great value .										
" For that price you get a glass of champagne, half a lobster and a wonderful hot and cold buffet ."										
 For the price and the location I thought this place was great .										
 Good price through ExpediaHotel in general is in good shapeTips :										
 Good pub nearby   with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price .										
 Got decent price on Hotwire as well .										
 GREAT location and bargain internet price !										
" Half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid, but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view ."										
 hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .										
" Hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles ."										
" However, a continental breakfast was included in the price and had a fairly large selection ."										
" However, if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience, I'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city ."										
" However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room ."										
 I could have bought a new pair of jeans for that price .										
 I had prepaid for the room on Hotwire good price at $120 .										
" I was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade, for the price of 35 pounds a night ."										
 I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London .										
" I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price ."										
" I would not stay at this Holiday Inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in London ."										
" I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it ."										
 I would stay here again if the price was right .										
" I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that ."										
" I’m pretty sure the driver took the most direct route from the hotel, so not sure why the difference in price ."										
" If you are just looking for basic lodging at a good price in London,  this is the place ."										
 If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .										
" If you're from the US, think 2, 3X the average price when you convert to US dollars ."										
" If you're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please, this is a good place for you ."										
" In particular, there was a nice Indian run coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price ."										
" In sum, we wouldn't pay rack rate for this hotel, but at a reduced price it's an efficient, functional place to stay in London ."										
 It's nicer than certain other hotels you'd get in the same price range on Priceline and all in all was nice .										
 Just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .										
" Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now ."										
" My friend and I had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for £8   in total ,  the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel !"										
 Nothing that spectacular to justify the price .										
" One day late and I paid the same price for a better room in HI Kensington, the supposedly better classed HI nearby   ."										
 One of the better places I've stayed in London for the price .										
" Overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !"										
 Reserved this hotel through Hotwire and got a price of $90 night .										
 So often I have booked a hotel at a price only to be disappointed with my choice on arrival .										
 Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .										
" That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast ."										
" The bags were located in the closet, but no price list ."										
" The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite ."										
" The continental breakfast which was included in the price was very nice and served in the dining room, a pleasant time before dashing off around the city ."										
 The Kensington Forum is about as close to an American style hotel as one can reasonably hope to find in London at a reasonable price .										
 The price for triple cost me 76 pounds at the height of the tourist season .										
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .										
 The price was a real bargain as the published price at the hotel was 210 pounds  !										
" The price was exceptional for the Kensington area, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it is a two or three minute walk to the Gloucester tube station ."										
" The price was right, and we were even told by an English tour guide that we had gotten a very good deal ."										
" The room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid ."										
" The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room ."										
" There is a great supermarket and some restaurants pubs ,  we ate one night at  Ask , which is a small chain of reasonable price ."										
 There is little difference in the price and when we return to London in three weeks I have booked the Millennium in preference to the Forum .										
" This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat ."										
 Thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid .										
 We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .										
 We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .										
" We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price ."										
" Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London ."										
\the staff is very friendlyi had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible .										
"00 Pounds, hotel guests get it at the amazing price of 15 ."										
00 which is an affordable price for a hotel in the posh area of Kensington .										
"After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !"										
All in all a pleasant stay for a good price .										
"All in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price !"										
All in all I would recommend and would stay again if the price was right !										
All in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again .										
"All in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price ."										
"All in all, it was a decent hotel, but I think I may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price ."										
"Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than I'd expected ."										
Bought the room for about 1 2 price using Hotwire .										
"com   and not the hotel web, site price of £160 ."										
"Despite the above problems I would recommend a stay here, price dependant ."										
Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .										
Explore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price .										
"For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service ."										
Good if you don't pay retail price .										
Good price   location but no thrills .										
Good Price Great Location Would definately stay there again !										
"Got this at a great price via priceline and at first was worried about Holiday Inn,  as usually don't care too much for this chain in the U ."										
Great Price Terrific Location .										
"I booked this hotel via Holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1  ."										
I booked this one as none of my favourites were available and I was amazed at the lowish price offered .										
"I got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary, for about £80 a night inc taxes, however after reading reviews about this hotel I was very worried about staying here ."										
I used priceline' name your own price and my bid of a $100 night was exepted for a Sunday and a Monday night .										
In short it's a good hotel if you get the price off lastminute .										
"It's an okay hotel, and I don't mind staying there again if I get it for a cheap price through Priceline ."										
"Our amazing deal from priceline did not include breakfast, but there were many places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast for a reasonable price before heading out for the day ."										
Our breakfasts and one dinner meal were included in our price .										
"Our Hotwire price did not include breakfast, but several restaurants were nearby, and the hotel had a reasonable coffee crossaint deal ."										
Our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .										
Our one night stay was arranged by the cruise line so I can't comment on the price .										
"Overall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely NOT worth paying retail price for ."										
"Restaurant ,  make sure to try Thai and Singapore restaurants ,  delicious and good price ."										
"Stayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid ."										
The biggest disappointment was the price of Internet .										
"the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price ."										
We have just stayed in the Kensington Forum and have to say that it is the best hotel we have stayed in in London for the price .										
We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .										
"We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults ."										
"Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness ."
