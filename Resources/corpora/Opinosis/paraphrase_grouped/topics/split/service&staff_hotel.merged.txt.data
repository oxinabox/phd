" But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable ."																											
																											
 But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .																											
" By the way, all housekeeping and room service requests are handled promptly ."																											
" Chicago is fantastic and i would recommend giordinos pizza  , we also did the chicago bus co tour, we paid fpr a 3 day pass which was worth the money because it is a hop on and off service and can be used to save your legs when you start to get tired ."																											
 Clean and comfortable with friendly service and a convenient Chicago location .																											
" Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens !"																											
" Concierge service from our experience was good from one but bad from another so if you don't get good help the first time you ask, just go ask again later when someone else is there ."																											
 Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .

 However the service was quite efficient  my pants were brought back the same day .																											
" However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service ."																											
 I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems .																											
 I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .

" I cannot comment on room services, however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful ."

 I ended up ordering room service .																											
 I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night .																											
 I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view .																											
" I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good ."																											
 I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and room service .																											
" I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay ."																											
" I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do, not, disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned ."

" I ordered room service late on Saturday night, and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago !"																											
" I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly ."																											
 I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .																											
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .																											
 I recommend this high class hotel with perfect service and will stay there again .																											
" I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro ."																											
 I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .																											
 I think that is bad service .																											
" I was also disappointed that the hotel's &quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery ."																											
 I won't be staying here again until I hear that they have upgraded this service .																											
 i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !																											
 I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .

" If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere ."																											
" If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff ."																											
 If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .																											
" In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay ."																											
" In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center ."																											
" In spite of its size, we found the service to be good ,  speedy check, in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm ."																											
" In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available ."																											
 Internet service worked fine with a $10 daily charge .																											
 Is this the level of customer service you want ?																											
 It amazes me that a hotel of this caliber does not understand customer service .																											
 It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service .																											
" It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour ."																											
" It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us ."																											
 It is not 4 star hotel service .																											
" It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good ."																											
" It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff ."																											
 It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .																											
" It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations ."																											
 Just don't ask anyone to provide you with outstanding service !																											
 Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a 4 star hotel .																											
 Lots of folks were checking out and the elevator service was slow .																											
" Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza ."																											
 Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .																											
 Maid service was prompt and outstanding .																											
" Maid service was prompt, too ."																											
" Maid service, perfect no complaints ."																											
 Mediocre room and service for a very extravagant price .																											
" Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc ."																											
" Mom didn’t want to walk too far at night, so after leaving Navy Pier   we came back to the room and I ordered room service for just the second time in my life ."

 My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .																											
" My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services ."																											
 My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service .																											
" Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters ."																											
 Never experienced the room service .																											
 Never had a problem with any service personnel .																											
" Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again ."																											
 No greeting when you called them   and the service was fine but indifferent .																											
" no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor ."																											
" no robes in the rooms, ice machines are not on every floor  , no turn down service at night, and when housekeeping did come, they did not replace the shower gel we had used which was totally empty ."																											
 Not sure why hotels don't seem to understand that their guests opinion of the hotel is influenced more by housekeeping services than it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .																											
" Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers ."																											
" On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service ."																											
 On the third night I tried room service again .																											
" On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services ."																											
" One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !"																											
" One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !"																											
 One thing that really impressed us was the excellent housekeeping service .																											
" One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby ."																											
 Only postive is their breakfast service .																											
 Ordering soup on room service will set you back around $20 																											
 Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel &amp  I felt the service and hotel were much better .																											
" Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !"																											
 Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .																											
" Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere ."																											
" Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service ."																											
" Overall, this hotel from top to bottom ,  service, furnishings, beds, appeal ,  is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn ."																											
" Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food ."																											
" potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff ."																											
" Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people ."																											
 Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .																											
" Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery ."																											
 Room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when I ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .																											
 Room service is limited after 10 p .																											
 Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .

" Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me ."

" Service at the front desk was very friendly and efficient while room, service breakfasts were quite good and delivered promptly ."

 Service with a smile always !																											
" So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it ."																											
" Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful ."																											
 Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service .																											
" Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel ."																											
 Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service .																											
 Split a fare w a private service i .																											
" stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive ."																											
																											
 Swissotel needs some training on customer service .

" Teaming this Hotel with the great food   service @ Cafe Pescatore, I would definitely choose this hotel again while in SF, an experience we won't ever forget ."																											
 The accomodations and support services are phenomenal .																											
" The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall ."																											
" The bell service at the front door was nice, opening the door of the cab when we arrived and always saying hello when we were entering or leaving the hotel but the reception and concierge service was not as polite, often making us feel like we were troubling them for recommendations or when asking about buses and maps ."																											
" The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice ."																											
 The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .																											
 The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .																											
 The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .																											
 The concierge and service line were both just okay .																											
" The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service ."

 The furniture was a little worn but the hotel's service and location made up for it .																											
" The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there ."

 The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .																											
 The Menu Prices for room service Forget it !																											
 The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .																											
 The only complaint I have is the Valet service .																											
" The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on, duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great ."																											
" The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters ."																											
 The person at the front desk said for room service to fill out the menu or go to the Palm restaurant and they would bill it to our room .																											
" The personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem, it is immediately remedied ."																											
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .																											
" The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted ."

 The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .

 There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water .																											
" There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel ."																											
" There’s a reason why it’s not the Holiday Inn and I’m assuming you stay there because of the amenities they offer and the service and location and views afforded and so no, you’re not going to pay corner diner prices at an upscale hotel ."																											
" They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town ."																											
" They did give us an extra bed for our little girl after we requested it but having stayed in the hampton inn and suites, milwaukee the days before, i have to say the service was poorer ."

" They had fantastic service there,  pricey, but so worth it ."																											
 They have demonstrated a wonderful ability to deliver consistent service and go above and beyond .																											
 They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .

 This is a great hotel with no customer service focus .																											
" This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality ."																											
 This restaurant is within the hotel but seems to operate independantly so you cannot order room service from the Palm but you can get take out and then have plates utensils delivered from room srevice .

 We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .																											
 We didnt use the parking or the gym or the pool and they have technology to remember the guests name when you call the concierge or the guest service they will address you by name .																											
 We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .																											
 We don't use the concierge services or any of the other services unless there is a problem .																											
 We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .

" While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago ."																											
" While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time ."																											
" Why is it that a $69 motel serves free breakfasts, turns on the TV when you push power on the remote and has free internet service ."																											
 WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .																											
 You can get better customer service elsewhere for much less .																											
" You'll pay hotel prices for breakfast, but the price was on par or slightly below breakfasts that we've had via room service at other hotels ."																											
", but after I called room service it was promptly fixed ."

00 through an online hotel booking service .																											
"3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access ."																											
"30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free ."																											
"30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality ."																											
"4 The restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests ."																											
6 Make sure to sign up for the Club Swiss Gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade .																											
"Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times ."																											
"Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   ."																											
and the service was just ok too .																											
As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .																											
Basic clean lodging service lacking .																											
"Beautiful Hotel ,  Service Slightly Lacking ."

I send an email about the voucher to Swissotel customer service when I returned home and did not receive a response .																											
I was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .																											
"I wish that the hotel had better service, however ."																											
I would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room .																											
i'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .

seems service just isn't the way it used to be .																											
"Service is excellent, the personnel strive to make you feel better ."																											
"Service was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?"																											
"service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world ."

 All staff members are very courteous and go the extra mile in meeting your needs during your stay .																											
 All the staff at the hotel were the epitomy of politeness and professionalism .																											
" All the staff we encountered, from doorman to desk lady who checked us in, to check out, was professional and courteous ."																											
" And all of the the staff were very professional, courteous and friendly ."

" I was concerned that the hotel staff would not be KID friendly, but they were all great !"																											
" If you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn’t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned ."																											
" Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office ."																											
 It's a block away from the Hyatt which I have also stayed at and isn't as nice as the Swissotel but at least its better staffed .

" No problem with check, in or out, and the staff was most accomodating ."																											
" Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers ."																											
 Of course I called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently .																											
 Our whole stay it felt like the staff went out of their way to make sure we had the best visit possible .																											
" Overall would stay elsewhrere downtown to many other properties who offer nicer staff assistance, quality for the price ."																											
" Positive ,  Great room, comfortable bedVery friendly staff, help you in any way they canInternet was $9 ."

 While we were there I would have to say I saw one or two people guests who were less than polite to the hotel staff .																											
 Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?																											
" would be satisfactory for security, and a slight air of detachment by the staff ."																											
" You come to a place like Trip Advisor and it’s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what ."																											
", staff very slow to offer coffee &amp  clear tables, and the cream on our table was off so had to ask for replacement, but in a nice tranquil setting with a good selection of fruits, cereals, pastries ."																											
"Back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city !"

" I can only think that some of the staff are very good and some equally bad, since our experience was a very positive one ."																											
 I could excuse this if staff was friendly but I left there dissapointed .																											
 I found the concierge and front desk staff to be helpful and the housekeepers to be quite good .																											
 I found the staff to be helpful when required but unobtrusive otherwise .																											
" I happened to go up to our room when the housekeeping staff was out in force ,  every single woman I passed said hello to me !"																											
 I have to say I see everyone that reviews this hotel compliments the front desk staff I actually found from the second day on that they were most unhelpful and actually quite rude !

" More intimate, close personal attention from the staff and exceptionally clean rooms ."																											
 My husband mentioned to the front desk staff that it would have been appreciated if someone had told us about the renovations when we made our reservation or at check in and was told that the hotel manager set the policy that the staff was to not tell guests .																											
" No mention of the lies, arrogance and ‘up you attitude’ of some of the staff then ?"																											
" One morning I overheard people booking in experiencing similar difficluties and a staff member trying to be helpful, I offered some assistance and we were told by him that since Best Western shifted its booking facility offshore there's nothing that Tuscan Inn staff can do to help guests ."																											
 One of the friendliest desk concierge staffs I've encountered   .
