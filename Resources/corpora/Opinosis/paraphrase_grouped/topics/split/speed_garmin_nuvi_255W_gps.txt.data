" And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes ."					 I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .	 The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .	 It knows exactly what the speed limit is on all major routes .
 But the name of the game for thieves is speed .					6 Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .	",  Tells you the streets speed limit"	Shows the speed limits on the major roads !
" By the way, the bottom menu also shows your current driving speed ."					 I liked the way it tells you the speed limit and how fast you are going .	" Lastly  , you can immediately see the speed limit for every road you are on ."	
" Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom ."						Indicates posted speed limits of the road you are on	
" For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit ."							
" From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places ."							
 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .							
 I also enjoy the estimated time of arrival feature that recalibrates itself automatically based on your travel speed .							
" I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless ."							
" I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few ."							
 I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance .							
" I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen ."							
 I have observed several cases on an interstate where the 255W required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .							
" I often find myself wondering if the speed limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location ."							
" I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate ."							
" I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down ."							
" I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !"							
 If it helps me avoid one speeding ticket it will have paid for itself .							
" If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets ."							
" In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling ."							
 It even tells you the speed limit on most roads .							
" It has a lot of good features ,  including a speedometer, posted speed limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your current trip ."							
 It is cool to always know what the speed limit is and exactly how fast you are traveling   .							
" It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles ."							
 It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .							
 It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .							
" On the lower left hand side, this unit shows the maximum speed limit for the road you are traveling ."							
 Some countries impose lower speed limit in residential areas .							
" Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch ."							
" SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is ."							
" That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn ."							
 That's what the car's speedometer is for .							
 The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed .							
" The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models ."							
" The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area ."							
 The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .							
" The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving ."							
" The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 ."							
 The speed limit is usually correct except on recently modified highways .							
" There should be some features built, in the device such as speed limit monitor ."							
 This greatly helps the driver to keep his eye on the road instead of looking at the speedometer from time to time .							
 This is very useful feature because many a times this will help to avoid the risk of getting a speeding ticket .							
" TomTom seems to underestimate speed limits on community highways and gives sub, optimal routes ."							
" Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7 ."							
" What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits ."							
" When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed ."							
" With a reset button, you can track your max speed, moving time, stopped time, average speed total for the trip, average moving speed, etc ."							
",  255w shows speed limit on most highways and some streets ."							
",  Speed of map updates is awesome ."							
",  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times ."							
", alerting you that a rest stop is coming up in a mile, or speed alerts ."							
Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .							
"I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception ."							
"LOCAL SPEED LIMIT SOMETIMES WERE NOT CORRECT,THEN WE WOULD PASS A SPEED LIMIT SIGN & IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF ."							
My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators .							
One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .							
Plus you can download speed cameras alerts at http :							
"SHOWING ACTUAL SPEED IS NICE ,  ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLE WOMEN, AS SHE LOVES TO REMIND ME ALONG THE WAY ."							
The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .							
The turn or exit instructions happen too close to the turns or exits when at highway speeds .
