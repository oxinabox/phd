  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, but I regret to advise him that the premises on which he has based his question are wrong. He does give me the opportunity, though, to explain some facts to him and this House about the arrangement that I have entered into with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Either the Leader of the Opposition does not understand this arrangement, or he is misrepresenting it in the public domain. This arrangement of course is to break the people smugglers' business model and to take out of the hands of people smugglers the very product it is that they sell. They seek to prey on misery; they seek to say to people that they can get them to Australia, that their asylum claims will be processed here and if those claims are found to be valid, they will be able to stay. The arrangement that Prime Minister Najib and I are committed to is an arrangement that will break this business model. The message to people smugglers and to asylum seekers would be that if you risk your life and spend your money on getting on a boat trying to come to Australia, you risk being taken to Malaysia and being put to the back of the queue. Malaysia is a country with tens of thousands of refugees who have genuine claims which have been processed and with no prospect of resettlement. Of those refugees we will take 4,000 extra, on top of our current humanitarian intake.                  The Leader of the Opposition has been out there first and foremost trying to pretend to the Australian people that the 800 asylum seekers who are taken to Malaysia will somehow come back to Australia within the 4,000 quota. This is not right. The 4,000 refugees taken from Malaysia will be people who are in Malaysia now, whose claims have been processed and who are genuine refugees. The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to say to the Australian people that somehow we, the Australian government, will not be able to have a say in the selection of those 4,000 refugees. Of course this is wrong. Right around the world we take people through our special humanitarian intake system and we work with UNHCR and others so that refugees who have valid claims come to this country and settle in this nation.                 Finally, the Leader of the Opposition has been representing that somehow it is the wrong thing to do to increase our humanitarian intake. He went to the last election saying he would increase that he would increase the humanitarian intake to 15,000. In a private conversation with the member for Dennison he said in the pursuit of his naked political interest that he would double it, costing the federal budget $3 billion. Let no Australian succumb to the analysis that the Leader of the Opposition can, without hypocrisy, criticise our decision to increase the humanitarian intake. The difference is that we explain it and we do it for a reason in the national interest. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to do it behind closed doors in his narrow political interest.

  The guffaws have already started because the opposition does not care about this government's top priority and that is having a strong economy. We are dedicated to making sure Australia has the benefits of a strong economy. The chief benefit of a strong economy is that Australians are able to get jobs. This government is proud of its record in creating 750,000 jobs in the last 3Â½ years at a time when unemployment increased around the world. Even in the second year of its recovery after the global financial crisis, the US unemployment rate is still at nine per cent. In contrast, our unemployment rate is at 4.9 per cent. We are on track to fall to 4.5 per cent during 2013, meaning that around 1.25 million new jobs will have been created since this government came to office. This has been our focus because of the importance to Australian families of people having a job.                 We recognise that there are challenges in our patchwork economy, our two-speed economy, which is why, in ensuring that our economy is strong, we will also make sure that families who are at risk of being left behind also experience the benefits of this mining boom, that they do not get left behind as the economy grows. We understand that there are still far too many Australians who are not sharing in the benefits and dignity of work. There are around 230,000 Australians who have been without work for more than two years and there are 250,000 families where no adult works. The youth unemployment rate is more than double the unemployment rate generally and we know that there are some pockets in our nation where it exceeds to even greater figures.                 In my view, there is nothing more important we can do as a government than make sure every Australian gets the benefit of opportunity, that we do not leave these Australians behind. With that opportunity comes responsibility. I have said that before. I believe that people must be in a position where they are expected to seek work and to perform work if they can do work - opportunity and responsibility working together.                 We will continue to make sure that our economy is strong. We want to spread the opportunities of the mining boom, to make sure in our patchwork economy, in our two-speed economy, that there are not Australians left behind. We will do all of this while returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13, on time, as promised, as I said to the Australian people at the last election. This is the right thing for the economy; it is the right thing to do with the budget; it is the right thing to do for Australian families - not adding to the inflationary pressures that will come with this period of growth.                 Now there is also a test for the Leader of the Opposition this week. On three occasions he has failed to make his figures add up - the election campaign, an $11 billion black hole; the flood package earlier this year a farce; last  year's budget reply speech where he delegated to the shadow treasurer who delegated to the shadow finance minister for a press conference which even his own press secretary could not bear to watch. On Thursday night the Leader of the Opposition must come into this parliament and, for the first time ever, make his figures add up. We will be very interested to see whether he can get that done.

  Let me tell you one thing: I am not going to take lessons on compassion from this opposition given its track record in government on children in detention, including unaccompanied minors. I am not going to take lessons on compassion from people who soiled themselves in government with a track record -                      On the question of treatment of children, this government has a record of ensuring that children of asylum seekers in this country are treated better than they were by the government that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister of. So let us not make any assumptions about treatment of children and who understands the needs of children best; let us just look to comparative track records - ours versus yours - and I will highlight ours in comparison with yours any day of the week.                     On the question of the arrangement with Malaysia, I am not going to stand here in this parliament today and engage in a game with the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on something as serious as this. What we are going to do is send the clearest possible message -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. The last words I used before you intervened to deal with the opposition were that I am not going to play a political game with the opposition about this today. The fact that this is all a political game for them was then verified by the interjection of the member for Indi. What this government will do is send a strong message to people smugglers that they cannot represent that they can get people to Australia, because when they make that representation the people they are making it to are at risk of being taken to Malaysia and ending up at the back of the queue.                  I can also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, with our increase of 4,000 in the humanitarian intake, I bet some of them are children. She like might like to explain why the Leader of the Opposition is opposing that intake.

  I thank the member for Holt for his question and I can report to him that the budget will -                      I am pleased to report that the budget will be back in the black, that we will have more jobs for Australians and that we will spread the opportunity of the mining boom across this nation. We will bring the budget back into surplus by 2012-13. The government has a strong fiscal strategy in place that has us on track to return to surplus well ahead of our peers. The strategy will ensure that, as we go forward, our public finances continue to be amongst the strongest in the developed world. This is the right economic strategy for the times and the right strategy for an economy which is expected to be pushing up against capacity over coming years.                 We have a strict fiscal strategy to get us back on track. We are allowing the level of tax receipts to recover naturally as the economy improves and we will be maintaining the government's commitment to keep the tax share of GDP below the 2007-08 level left by our predecessors. We have a strict spending cap in place. We have been offsetting every single dollar in new spending. In fact, over the last three budgets, we have saved something like $83.6 billion. Members of the House might be interested to know that that number is seven times the savings put in place by the former government in their last three budgets. I have been asked to talk about what risks there are to these plans. Mr Speaker, I can tell you that the risk to these plans sits opposite. The Leader of the Opposition is a risk to these plans to get us out of deficit. If we were to use the opposition numbers as economic strategy, we would be in deficit every year over the next four years. On their latest reckoning, not only are the Liberals stuck in the red next year but they remain there for every single year of the budget. This would be three years after the shadow Treasurer, interestingly, the other day committed to getting the budget, if they were in charge, to surplus by next year; yet their other numbers show it would take them at least another three years. The mob opposite have a track record and well might the opposition -                      The opposition are yelling out because they know what is coming. They know that in the election they had an $11 billion con job. Remember the con job. Treasury and Finance dissected their savings after the election and it was found that they had an $11 billion black hole. Hang your heads in shame, Coalition. And then, when they tried to work out where to find some new ideas, let us not forget that they went down the road to the outhouse of conservative politics and asked One Nation for their ideas. There is no doubt that there is a very real risk to this budget surplus, and they sit opposite.                  On Thursday night the opposition have a clear choice: they can support the plans to return this budget to surplus by 2012-13 or they can squib the challenge. Budget week is not just about the government but about the opposition, and our challenge to the opposition is don't squib the challenge of taking the budget into surplus. None of us will forget, of course, that the opposition leader squibbed it last year. He handballed it to Joe Hockey the next Wednesday, who handballed it to poor old Andrew Robb, who was left to try and find the cuts.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. In fairness, the honourable member has criticised me in recent weeks about this event, which I acknowledge. It appears that the honourable member for Cook, if he were to hold the office that I hold, would ignore the advice of the Australian Federal Police that it would have been unsafe for the Australian Federal Police to get on the roof to remove the detainees who were protesting.                     As I was saying, the government took the advice of the Australian Federal Police about how to best manage what was a difficult situation, as I think the member for Cook would do if he were to hold the office I hold. If he were not to do that, if he ignored the advice of the Australian Federal Police, he would not be fit to hold the office that I hold. It was clearly the case, as I have previously said publicly, that the three detainees who were on the roof also accessed the roof cavity. I have said that publicly before. I am sure the member for Cook reads transcripts of my radio interviews. I have also made it clear that I authorised the appropriate use of force if the safety of the officers using the force could be guaranteed and could be justified. I made it very clear that the use of force was authorised by me if appropriate and if regarded by the Australian Federal Police as being safe.

  I thank the member for New England for the question. There are a number of referrals that have come with this gas project around the Liverpool Plains. The reference that the member for New England has made to a fifth pathway for the pipeline is not among the referrals that have come to my department. At the moment there are four separate referrals before the department. Three of them are decisions due this week as to whether or not they get called in for full approval. If they get called in for full approval then, in all probability, that will end up coming directly to me rather than being dealt with by my delegate. When the decisions are dealt with, they will not be able to deal with the full range of issues which sometimes come up through public debate. They are environmental approvals and have to be made under the EPBC Act under national environmental law.                 Some of the pathways for these pipelines proposed at the moment do have issues that relate to some national environmentally listed species. There are issues with respect to the swift parrot and some gum woodlands listed that would be relevant to some of the pathways. I would be surprised if those issues were relevant to a pathway along a highway that the member for New England has referred to but, as I say, that is not among the referrals that have come to me.                 When the department makes a decision as to whether or not it needs to be dealt with under national environmental law, if it is decided that that is not required, then it will not be dealt with by me any further. If it is called in for full referral, then those decisions will be made in accordance with the law and there will be opportunities for public discussion and input during those processes.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. The government has consistently said that it will pursue an international agreement to break the business model of the people smugglers and that is what the Gillard government has delivered. We have consistently said that we needed an international solution to an international problem and that is what the Prime Minister's of Australia and Malaysia have committed to agree to.                 People smugglers now need to find 800 volunteers to part with their money, to risk their lives, to come to Australia only to return to Malaysia. Interestingly, Malaysia is the point of entry for most asylum seekers who come to Australia by boat. This is where they normally begin their boat journey. So why would you part with your money and risk your life to be returned to where you started?                 Of course, the government has also used this opportunity to increase our refugee intake and to assist Malaysia with the challenges of managing the 92,000 registered asylum seekers in Malaysia. We will, over the next four years, take 4,000 refugees who have been processed and mandated by the United Nations in Malaysia. I note that this has come in for some criticism from the opposition, from the Leader of the Opposition in particular and from the member for Cook. The Leader of the Opposition says it is a bad deal and that we do not have a good enough deal. The Leader of the Opposition knows a bit about making deals when it comes to asylum seekers. We know he offered to double the refugee intake to the member for Denison in return for one vote on the floor of the House of Representatives. That would have been a bad deal. That would not have been a good negotiating tactic on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition.                 We also see that the member for Cook has been criticising this arrangement. On one level that is his job as the shadow minister for immigration. But I must say I was a little surprised to see that. The other option available to the member for Cook would have been to claim credit for the idea. He could have said, 'Actually, this was my idea,' because, when the member for Cook saw the announcement on Saturday - I am sure he was sitting at home watching it on television - I am sure his mind went back to the speech he made on 30 November last year which was very modestly entitled 'A real solution: an international, regional and domestic solution to asylum policy'. The international component to the member for Cook's solution was in his words, 'a trade-off'. He said:                 In my view, Australia's participation in a regional solution for Afghanistan should seek to trade off Australia taking more refugees out of the camps in countries of first asylum in that region in return for the ability to return those who have sought to advantage their asylum claims through illegal entry to Australia, to those same camps or other safe places established for that purpose, as part of the regional solution.                 'To take more out of refugee camps,' the member for Cook argued. He went on to say:                 Under this proposal -                  It was a good speech, Mr Speaker -                  Australia would continue to honour our obligations under the Refugee Convention, but use the safe third country provisions provided under the Migration Act ...                 When I heard and read that speech of 30 November last year I thought, 'He's onto us. He's onto our idea we are pursuing.' In fairness, he suggested that this deal should be done with Iran. I will leave the member for Cook to explain why Iran makes more sense than Malaysia. The people smugglers should be under no illusions. We will do what it takes to break the people smugglers business model.

  Police forces, whether state or federal, when making decisions on operational matters, take into account all the evidence before them as to what is safe in the circumstances. If the member for Stirling is suggesting that he understands the situation better than the Australian Federal Police on the ground, if he is better qualified to make those judgments than the experts who make those decisions every day and the people who risk their lives in those situations, then he should explain that to the Australian Federal Police.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let me explain to the Leader of the Opposition the fundamentals of this budget. This budget is bringing the budget back into surplus in 2012-13, as promised. That has meant that we have needed to take a series of tough decisions. We did not want to see in this budget the profligacy of the Howard years during mining boom mark 1. Consequently, when you look at this budget, you see an average increase in expenditure of one per cent, compared with an average increase in expenditure of 3.6 per cent under the Howard government. We are being so rigorous on bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised, because we are determined to continue to deliver to the Australian people a strong economy which gives them the benefit of jobs - 750,000 created already, with another half a million to be created in the years to come. So, yes, there have been some tough decisions taken in this budget in relation to savings.                 On the family payments question that the Leader of the Opposition raised, let me say what the actual information is.                     The Leader of the Opposition asked me about family payments. For the clarification of the House and for the Leader of the Opposition so that he has the accurate information - and I believe that he is under an obligation to make sure that what he says to the Australian people is accurate - family payments will still increase under this budget. All fortnightly rates will still increase for family tax benefits A and B. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition does not want the facts but these are the facts. For example, on 1 July the maximum rate will increase by $113 per annum for a child between the ages of zero and 12 and by $146 per annum for a child between the ages of 13 and 15. In relation to family tax benefit B, for the youngest child under five years of age, per family there is a $95 increase annually; for kids aged between five and 18 years, $66 annually.                 This budget honours our commitment to increase payments for the parents of teenagers, as we said we would during the election campaign. So parents of teenagers on the maximum rate can look forward to an increase of $4,208 in their family payments if they have a child of 16 to 17 years and $3,741 if they have a child of 18 to 19 years. They are important figures about family payments in this budget and if the Leader of the Opposition wants to accurately talk about this budget, he should be referring to those figures.                 The Leader of the Opposition also raised with me the cost of mandatory detention and continuing to process asylum seekers. I support mandatory detention. I believe it is an appropriate policy to check people who come to this country unauthorised - to check their health, to check their security status and to process their claims. So we will continue to fund mandatory detention because it is the right thing to do. We will continue with the Malaysia agreement which has been the subject of discussion in this House this week and which was announced by me and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on Saturday. It is a big blow for people-smugglers and aimed at breaking the people-smugglers' business model. It is the right thing to do. It is better than a three-word slogan.

  I thank the member for Dobell for that question. The budget I handed down last night reaffirms Australia's record as one of the best performing developed economies in the global economy. We have strong growth prospects, we have strong job creation and we are getting the budget back in the black in record time.                 We have avoided in this country the very high rates of unemployment that have occurred in other advanced economies and we have avoided the crippling levels of debt that we have seen in other advanced economies. We have a budget bottom line which is indeed the envy of the developed world and levels of deficit and debt which are the envy of the developed world but, despite this strength, we know there has been short-term softness. We know that parts of our country have been badly affected by natural disasters, and we know that many parts of the economy still feel the overhang of the global financial crisis and the global recession, which is also weighing very heavily on government revenues. And of course there are many businesses out there that are certainly struggling under the weight of the high dollar.                  But against all of this we know that we have a very big investment pipeline in Australia. We are going to go through an investment boom, with business investment set to reach 50-year highs in the years ahead. That is why we are forecasting growth of four per cent in 2011-12 and 3Â¾ per cent in 2012-13. And that is why we are forecasting unemployment to come down to 4.5 per cent, because at the core of this budget is our commitment to jobs, jobs and more jobs. That is our commitment. It is not a commitment that was shared by those opposite during the global financial crisis and the global recession. If they had had their way, unemployment in this country would be far higher and deficits and debt would be far higher.                  So we are very optimistic about the future of our economy, because we can now build on the strength of our economy as we come through the global recession. That is why the budget gets us back in the black, gets more Australians into better jobs, gives more help to families and, particularly - something we are all proud of on this side of the House - invests in mental health. So the budget is about laying down an economic blueprint for the future so we can succeed in the Asian century and maximise the opportunities for our children and our grandchildren.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: how quickly they forget. Many may think I am referring to the Work Choices advertising campaign, an obscenity overseen by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, but actually I am referring to last year's budget papers, because the climate change line item he is referring to appeared in last year's budget papers and has been brought forward into this year's budget papers. So can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, before he starts making inflammatory claims about where line items in the budget have come from, that he should perhaps do some budget study. That allocation for the climate change fund was standing in the last budget.                 On the question of memory: the Leader of the Opposition of course was a very senior minister in the Howard government and he may recall the goods and services tax. He may also recall that the then Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that a full two years before he accounted for it in the budget papers. One can only assume from the reaction of the Leader of the Opposition that each and every day of those two years he was running around to the Prime Minister's office saying to John Howard, 'I just can't bear it; I can't continue to serve as a minister while this isn't accounted for in the budget.' Does anybody really think that is what happened? Well, no, that is not what happened, because of course the Leader of the Opposition is always keen to apply a standard to others that he does not apply to himself.                 Let us get to the basis of this question. It is because the Leader of the Opposition would prefer to come into this parliament and continue his climate change fear campaign than deal with the matters in the budget. He does not care about a strong economy; he has got no policies or plans for one. He does not care about bringing the budget back to surplus; he has got an $11 billion black hole on his side of the ledger. He does not care about the creation of employment in our nation; he has got no policies or plans that relate to creating employment. He does not care about the future of our healthcare system; when he had the opportunity, he ripped $1 billion out of public hospitals. He does not care about the future of our schools, because he went to the last election promising to rip the best part of $3 billion out of Australian schools. He does not care about Australian apprenticeships, because he went to the last election promising a $2 billion cut to apprentices.                 So there is no mystery that the Leader of the Opposition does not come into this place to debate the budget. He cannot and he will not, because he is a big risk to the budget and the nation's economic future - a risky approach taken every day. Every big call required of a leader in this nation he has got wrong, most particularly the calls necessary for the global financial crisis and keeping people in work. We will continue to get the big calls right, we will continue to manage the budget and get it back into surplus and we will continue to prioritise the jobs of Australians, because this budget is centrally about jobs and opportunity for Australians right around the nation - and the Leader of the Opposition has just turned his back on that.

  I thank the member for her question. On delivering our fiscal prudence in this budget, the statistics are there for all to see. As promised, we will return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 - back in the black, just as we promised the Australian people. We will do that because the important thing to assist Australians as our economy moves towards full capacity is to make sure that the government is not adding to inflationary pressures. That is why we are determined to run such a tight spending policy. That is why across the forward estimates you are seeing growth in spending on average at one per cent. The last time that occurred in Australia was in 1988 e have delivered a year with a negative in front of increasing growth - that is, spending will go backwards. The Howard government never delivered a year of spending reduction. Rather, they delivered spending growth in excess of three per cent on average even at the top of resources boom mark I. The best thing we can do to assist families with cost-of-living pressures is to keep our economy strong and to bring the budget to surplus so as to not add to inflationary pressures which would then feed into the cost of living for working families.                  But we can do some things as well to directly assist working families, to assist families under cost of living pressure, and in this budget we have. We are assisting families with teenagers. Our family payment system has made the old-fashioned assumption that somehow kids leave school when they are very young. We are in a modern economy - we need them to stay in school. So families with teenagers will get special new benefits.                 For some of our lower income working Australians, we have pulled forward the low-income tax offset so they can benefit week by week from the money from that low income tax offset to take a little bit of pressure off and to more clearly demonstrate to people the rewards of work. We have in this budget honoured our commitment to include school uniforms in the education tax refund because we want to assist families with the costs of getting kids to school. We have in this budget honoured our commitment to enable families to get their childcare payments fortnightly, because we understand that that too will provide a bit of cost of living relief.                 We understand that right around the nation there are families battling cost-of-living pressures. As a government we will be working with them, doing what we need to do to keep our economy strong, to keep people in jobs and employment, to make sure they have decent working conditions when they are there - which is why we got rid of Work Choices - and to provide targeted relief in a budget that will get us back into black exactly as promised.

  The shadow Treasurer is proof that hot air is not an economic policy. The fact is that we are bringing this budget back into the black, we are doing it by making savings, we are doing it in 2012-13 and we are doing it despite the opposition's fiscal vandalism and their refusal to support responsible savings. Fair dinkum! The shadow Treasurer was on television last night. He said on the one hand that it was too tough and on the other hand that we are not spending enough. This shadow Treasurer walks both sides of the street all the time. The fact is that we will come back to surplus because this government has done the hard yards. We have put in place the spending restraints that those opposite were not capable of exercising during their 12 years in government. We have average spending each year over the budget estimates increasing by just one per cent. When they were in power, it was increasing by 3.7 per cent. They went on a spending spree at the height of mining boom Mark I. We are doing the hard yards of bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 by making $22 billion worth of savings and putting in place one of the biggest fiscal consolidations or returns to surplus that we have seen in this country.                 The shadow Treasurer quotes some sensitivity analysis from the budget papers. That is not the central forecast in the budget papers and he seeks to misrepresent it. He seeks to misrepresent it for political purposes. We will come back to surplus in 2012-13, because that is the central forecast that we have from the advisers who work both with them as forecasters and with us as forecasters. We are doing it despite the fact that there have been substantial revenue write-downs. We are doing it because we have shown the strict fiscal discipline to bring our budget back to surplus, a discipline that those on that side of the House simply do not understand.                 We are coming back to surplus and we are doing it in a responsible way with a very strict fiscal policy and we will do it in 2012-13. We will build surpluses after that and we will continue to apply our two per cent cap. There is a stark difference between the approach of us on this side of the House and the approach of those opposite. What they want to do in reality is to wreck the surplus. If they succeeded in wrecking the surplus, they would put price pressures into the Australian economy and all Australians would be the victims of that.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question because at the very core of the budget delivered last night is a plan to spread the opportunities of the mining boom to every corner of our country and to every postcode in our country. We are responding to the challenges posed by the mining boom which mean that some parts of the economy are stronger than others. And they mean that there will be a patchwork economy out there. Many small businesses and many towns which are not in the fast lane coming from the mining boom will face challenges because of this very strong investment phase into which we are entering. That lies at the very core of all the propositions put forward in the budget last night and goes to the very core of why the government put in place the mining resource rent tax, which will provide a stream of revenue to enable us to spread the opportunities of the boom to every corner of our country and to every postcode. That revenue - opposed by those opposite who have the ridiculous proposition that that somehow the mining companies are paying too much tax - will, first of all, mean that Australians get fair value for the minerals they own 100 per cent and, secondly, to give a helping hand and a lift up to those sectors of the patchwork economy that are not in the fast lane. So the revenue we are using from the mineral resource rent tax goes to invest in infrastructure, particularly in mining regions. That is very important economically. Also, we are going to assist those on low incomes with additional superannuation for all workers whose income is under something like $37,000. The member asked: what do we think about a sovereign wealth fund? With our superannuation accounts we have eight million of them in this country - a creation of far-sighted Labor governments which understood that we need, as a country, to save more. We want to boost in the superannuation savings of low-income workers in our community. And remarkably that is opposed by those opposite.                  The other thing we want to do - and this is really important - is give some tax breaks to small business. With the revenue from the minerals resource rent tax we want to give a tax cut to small business, spreading it right around the country. It is very important to give that $5,000 instant asset write-off to small business because that really assists small business with their cash flow. In the budget last night we announced an addition when we said we would allow businesses to write-off the first $5,000 in the purchase of a vehicle like a ute. That will help a lot of contractors out there who are not in the fast lane and a whole lot of those tradies. We have a comprehensive plan to deal with the patchwork economy, to deal with the challenges that come from mining boom mark II, to spread the opportunities of it right around the country, not just with the opportunities coming from the resource rent tax but also in the skilling of our workforce  because we need people in every corner and every postcode of this country to be the beneficiaries and the participants in the mining boom. All of the initiatives in the budget are aimed at that.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question because we are seeing the quickest return to surplus on record and that is occurring well ahead of comparable countries. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada will not even have halved their deficits of a share of GDP by 2013. In 2013, the major advanced economies will still be in collective deficit of around five per cent of GDP and of course Australia will be back in the black. As I was saying before, we are doing that because we have put in place the essential savings - $22 billion worth of savings, two-thirds of those spending cuts. We are seeing the fastest fiscal consolidation on record.                 I have seen some of the statements from those opposite but there has also been a number of statements from the market economists and the rating agencies. This is what the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poors said:                 The deficits and additional borrowings do not alter the sound profile of Australia's public finances which remain among the strongest of its peer group.                  Mr Blythe from the Commonwealth Bank said:                 The Budget meets all the requirements of the government's medium-term fiscal strategy _ Our judgement is that this Budget largely delivers what is required from a short-term cyclical perspective. And it represents a step forward in setting up the economy for the longer haul.                 That is the correct analysis of what we have done. We have the right fiscal settings for the future: bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 and making sure we do not compound the inflationary pressures that will come from the mining boom.                 Of course, the shadow Treasurer has promised to bring the budget back into surplus next year. So everybody in this House is waiting with bated breath to see the Leader of the Opposition come into this House tomorrow night and indicate how he is going to bring the budget back to surplus next year. I would not be too optimistic about his chances of that because, as we all know, following the last election the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation had a look at their savings and found there was an $11 billion hole in their savings. We look forward to seeing how they are going to bring forward the savings to bring this budget back to surplus. I think they have already said in the media in the last couple of days that they are opposing something like $3 billion worth of savings. So they are going to start a long way behind. We are all waiting with bated breath to see how the Leader of the Opposition is going to bring the budget back to surplus in the next year. Failure to do so will prove that all they are full of is hot air.

  I thank the member for Longman for that question because under our youth allowance changes he would have to keep studying and not go on the dole. This is because we have a fundamental commitment to learn or earn as part of the participation initiatives we have put in place in this budget. So we have a fundamental commitment to a range of initiatives in participation and skills. We have a fundamental participation agenda which makes sure that people have the opportunity to participate in the workforce and make a significant contribution to our country.                 It is a very serious question. We will come back to surplus in 2012-13 because we have put in place very strict fiscal discipline - the fastest fiscal consolidation that we have seen on record. We have put forward $22 billion worth of savings and our record stands in stark contrast to those opposite.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question.                     I do thank the member for McEwen for his question because I know, unlike those interjecting, that he is deeply concerned about Australians having the benefits and dignity of work. The story of this budget is a story of getting the budget back into surplus, as our economy requires as it moves towards full capacity. We will get the budget back into surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised. It is the right thing to do by the economy and it is the right thing to do by families facing cost of living pressures.                 But the story of this budget is also a story of jobs and opportunity. We believe in the benefits and dignity of work. We believe for Australians that a life of opportunity starts by having access to a job, and then by having access to skills and training and the means and wherewithal to get a better job - to get the next job and to keep progressing across their working lives. That is why when you look at the measures we have focused on in this budget, in circumstances where we have kept growth in spending so low, we have had to make tough choices but we have deliberately prioritised those things that go to give Australians a life of opportunity.                 With the resources boom coming into full swing, and with unemployment moving down to 4.5 per cent, we have a historic opportunity to make a difference in long-term disadvantage in this country and to reach out to those Australians who are on the margins of Australia's life, who are on welfare and who do not have the benefits and dignity of work in their lives. That is, of course, about a pay packet and the choices that a pay packet gives you in your life, but it is also about the sense of self-worth and self-dignity - the personal connections and self-esteem that comes from having a job. We believe in the benefits and dignity of work. That is why we are so proud of having created 750,000 jobs and why we are proud that another half a million jobs will be created in the next two years. It is why we are so proud in this budget of the $3 billion skills package to give people new opportunities to get the skills they need to get their first job, to train again and to get a better job. Of course, the skills package comes with a profound reform agenda so that our training system can meet the needs of a modern economy, meet the needs of modern learners and meet the needs of our industries and businesses that most need access to skills during this phase of our economic growth.                 This Labor budget comes with particular care and concern for those Australians who have been outside the mainstream of economic life: the very long-term unemployed, people with disability who can and want to work, single mums with teenage kids who need to get back into the workforce - a lifetime with a pay packet in front of them. These are Australians for whom we have shown care and concern. Yes, we have asked people to step up to new responsibilities and we have met that step-up with new opportunities to get people into work so that they can have a life and a life chance. This is a Labor budget through and through - delivered in the economic circumstances that the nation needs now and delivered by me as Prime Minister with Treasurer Wayne Swan and our economic team informed by Labor values which centre on giving people the simple opportunity of a job.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. The fact is that over the forward estimates we are saving $5 billion more than we will spend and, as I was indicating before, we will put in place the biggest fiscal consolidation - that is, return to surplus - we have seen since there have been records. We are applying a very strict fiscal discipline and not only will we do it across the forward estimates but we have indicated we will continue to do it until surpluses get back to one per cent of GDP.                 The member for North Sydney goes on about the deficit this year and the deficit next year. It is very clear from all of the budget papers that we have had very substantial revenue write-downs, $16 billion worth of revenue write-downs over both of those years. That is what has contributed to the increased deficits in those years. Of course, the cause has been the global financial crisis and the global recession, and the other cause has been the natural disasters in Queensland, which have had a dramatic impact on growth, particularly this year. But the opposition, as usual, must have slept through the global financial crisis, the global recession and the natural disasters in Queensland, because they will never acknowledge the impact of those events on our budget line. They never want to acknowledge that impact because they know that, had they been in power during that period, they would not have moved to do what we did. Deficits and debt would be far higher right now and unemployment would be far higher now had they had been in charge of our economy during that period.                 The member for North Sydney asked me about interest rates. I refer him to the statement on monetary policy issued by the Reserve Bank last Friday, which points out that the government is running a tight fiscal policy. It pointed that out and everyone can see it in the budget papers. If you go to the analysts, the market economists and all the rating agencies, they have all commented on the fact that the government are implementing its medium-term fiscal strategy on time. We are doing it and we are doing it successfully, and we are doing it because we have applied ourselves to a very strict fiscal discipline - not a fiscal discipline that those opposite applied when they were in government. I was asked a question about spending. Our spending will get down to 23.5 per cent of GDP, and that is lower than the average when those opposite were in government, bar for one year.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. For months now Australians have been saying that they want their nation to do better in mental health. The Prime Minister has said, 'For the nation to do better, we need to do more as a national government.' This budget delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health reform a priority for this term of government. The budget delivers the largest ever mental health reform package with over $2.2 billion in new measures, including more than $1.5 million announced last night and more than $600 million announced over the course of the last 12 months. Combined with our additional investments in mental health subacute beds through the Health and Hospitals Fund and in the psychiatric workforce, the total commitment by the Gillard government in mental health tops $2.5 billion over five years.                 We have listened closely to the voices of millions of Australians who live with mental illness and their families, their carers and, of course, the experts. This package takes action on their advice and I am glad to report it has been warmly welcomed across the sector and across the broader community. The package recognises the diverse impact of mental illness across a lifetime. It will build resilient kids. It will support teenagers dealing with the challenge of emerging mental illness. It will improve access to basic primary-care services for hard to reach groups across Australia and it will target -                      Ask a proper question.                   The member for Dickson then left the chamber.                     It is apparent that the member for Dickson could not get a question up in tactics today so he had to try a point of order.                     This package recognises the diverse impact of mental illness across a person's lifetime. It will build resilient kids. It will support teenagers dealing with the emergence of mental illness. It will deliver more targeted primary-care services across the community and it will deliver targeted, intensive and integrated supports for adults dealing with severe and chronic mental illness. We take the COAG process very seriously, which is why we will be taking more than $200 million to the table later this year to help drive improvements in emergency departments and in supportive accommodation, as well as continuing our plans for a long-term reform roadmap over the coming decade. We will establish the first ever national mental health commission reporting not to any particular department but to the Prime Minister and to this parliament.                 Unlike the opposition's policies, these measures are properly costed and they are fully funded. They keep in place the broader health reform measures that the opposition would have trashed, like the e-health record, by better targeted primary-care infrastructure for local communities, like more targeted hospital funding instead of continuing to send the states a blank cheque and, of course, like the GP after-hours hotline. This reform package is comprehensive, it is balanced, it is targeted across the lifespan and it will make a real difference to millions and millions of Australians living with mental illness and their families.

  I am more than happy to answer the same question that was asked before, again. The fact is this: the government has in place the fastest fiscal consolidation on record, which is 3.8 per cent of GDP over two years. We have put in place very substantial savings. I have also referred to the fact that, last Friday, the Reserve Bank in its statement of monetary policy pointed to just how tight fiscal policy in Australia is. So any suggestion that, somehow, our fiscal policy -                      Mr Speaker, I was making the point that fiscal policy is tight and fiscal policy is getting tighter. That is the point that I was making. Of course it has been the point that has been made today and last night by any number of market economists. I will quote Tim Toohey, Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs: 'It proposes a budget that represents the biggest fiscal contraction since 1970, when comparable data commenced. The budget makes a genuine attempt to keep its commitment to return the budget to surplus.'                 The opposition are out there quoting all sorts of people. Moody's said: 'Australian government debt remains the lowest of all AAA rated governments in the world.' The fact is we do have a fiscal position which is the envy of the world. We have low net debt compared to any of our peers and we have the strictest fiscal policy in place as we go forward, not just over the forward estimates but in the years ahead.                 What this government will not do is what the coalition government did when, at the height of a mining boom, they went on a spending spree. They neglected to invest in infrastructure and skills and they had 10 interest rate rises in a row. I am sure everybody in Australia understands that. We understand how important it is that government actions do not compound price pressures which flow from the investment pipeline that we are seeing. That is why we have in place a fast fiscal consolidation. The only threat to those fiscal settings are those opposite, and if they want to vandalise the surplus, they will live with the consequences.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question because she knows that last night's budget delivers for Australian families. We are delivering extra financial assistance for low- and middle-income families, especially those families with teenagers. Of course, it is this government that is also delivering for those families who need intensive support alongside tougher obligations for those families who are living in areas of entrenched disadvantage. We want to make sure that they get the extra help they need to make sure that they can get the skills to make them ready for work so they, too, can share in the benefits of our economic opportunities.                 The highlight for families in last night's budget is the increase in family tax benefit part A for those families who have teenagers aged between 16 and 19. This is an increase in the amount of money that families with teenagers will receive and it will be a cost to the budget of around $770 million. That is $770 million to boost support for families. Of course, if you are a family on the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A, that will mean that you will get an increase of up to $4,200 if you have a child aged between 16 and 19 and that child is still attending secondary school. What this will, in fact, do is increase support for 650,000 families over the next five years.                 The government is introducing this change because, currently, assistance drops by $150 a fortnight when your child turns 15. Whose policy would that have been? Of course, it was the Liberal Party's policy that they had for 12 years that saw family tax benefit part A drop when your child turned 15. Our reforms, which we introduced in last night's budget, will fix exactly that. The vast majority of Australians who have heard about this reform support it. I do say 'the vast majority,' and you would be surprised to wonder that there are some - not many, but some - who do not. They seem to me to be so out of touch with the needs of families that they are not supporting this idea. You might wonder who I am referring to. It is none other than the member for Sydney.                     The member for North Sydney - sorry, Tanya! The member for Sydney is a big supporter. The member for North Sydney, when asked on ABC TV's Insiders if he would support the government's extra assistance for families with teenagers, said:                 _ I'm curious as to why the government is proceeding with this _                 That is what the member for North Sydney said on Sunday: 'curious'. The opposition is curious as to why you would want to give extra support to families with teenagers. This shadow Treasurer is out there with Alice in Wonderland. I will tell you why we want to give extra support to families with teenagers: it is because they cost more as they get older. We want to keep them in school and it is only the Liberal Party that opposes it.

  There is no secret about net debt. Net interest payments are $5.5 billion in 2011-12. There is no secret about that at all. And net debt is 7.2 per cent - that is, $106 billion.                     It is truly amazing that those opposite would carry on like this when we have a net debt level which is the envy of the developed world. The reason we have that net debt level is that we moved to support our economy during the global recession, which saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians and kept open the doors of tens of thousands of small businesses. This was a very important support -                      I would like to quote the credit rating agency Moody's. Moody's said about debt:                 Moody's notes that Australian government debt remains among the lowest of all AAA-rated governments.                 Of course that is the case. We have one of the best positions in the advanced world, and one of the reasons it is that low is that we moved to support our economy at a time of threat. Those opposite want to continue to pretend that the global financial crisis did not happen, that a global recession did not happen and that it did not wash through or touch our economy. It did, and it had a dramatic impact on revenues and it would have had a dramatic impact on employment if they had had their way. We moved to support our economy. We took on a modest level of debt to keep Australians in work and to keep the doors of business open, and Australia is all the better for it. We will come back to surplus in 2012-13. We will build surpluses, we will pay down debt and we will do that with a really healthy, strongly growing economy, which would not be the case if those vandals over there had been in charge.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that when I visited his electorate with the member for Corio the local community received - in some cases with tears in their eyes, as was the case with the nurses at Geelong Hospital - the news that the cancer centre that had for so long been their dream in Geelong was coming to reality. That is because in this year's budget we have allocated $1.8 billion - $1.3 billion of that being spent on 63 projects across the country in regional Australia. This has been received so well in the community that I have to report to the House that something incredibly strange happened. That incredibly strange thing was that the member for Indi actually said thank you. The member for Indi said thank you to the government for the $65 million being invested in the Albury regional cancer centre, which forms part of 24 cancer centres across the country. This has been made possible because this is the government's fourth health reform budget in a row. It is a health reform budget that proves that we did not have to choose between regional Australia and mental health. We did not have to choose between health reform and mental health. We have been able to fund all of those priorities because of the good work done by this government, by the Treasurer and by others and because of the priority that we give to investing in important health services that are needed across the country. Unlike those opposite, we have been able to fund each and every one of those commitments.                 I know in communities such as Wagga, Palmerston, Hervey Bay and Bega - all across the country - people are very grateful that these investments have been made. Of course, my friends, who are sitting together - the member for Lyne, the member for Denison, the member for O'Connor and the member for New England - have also had their communities very enthusiastically receive news of our investment in hospitals not only in their electorates but in many other electorates as well. We are not just investing in infrastructure. The sorts of initiatives that the minister for mental health has already taken the House through show that we are serious and show the community that we will listen to their concerns. I want to take this opportunity to thank not just the minister for mental health but all of the advocates that he worked very closely with to make sure that this package was truly going to meet the needs of the community. It would truly meet the needs of those young people who needed support, it would not neglect the needs of children, it would look at the needs of adults with severe and persistent mental health problems and it would put pressure on our state colleagues to work with us to invest more to make sure that our hospital services whether they are in the acute system, the hospital services, or whether they are in the community, working with GPs and psychologists and others, provide better services for those who have been falling through the gaps for far too long.                 But the real question now for the Leader of the Opposition, having seen the fourth health reform budget in a row, is for him to be able to articulate on Thursday what, as a former health minister, he would prefer to do in these areas and to tell us for once how he would actually fund those initiatives. We know last time when he tried to fund some of these packages that he wanted to stop funding e-health, even though as health minister he promised to. He wanted to close super clinics. He has never once said whether he supports these regional hospital projects across the country, and it is about time he told us if he did.

  I thank the member for his question. What I can say to the member is that if he studies the details of the budget papers and particularly the announcement made by the Minister for Defence last week, he will find that there has been some movement of capital for issues associated with the procurement of that capital and then of course there have been arrangements made on the civilian side, the public service side, of Defence for new efficiencies, which will occasion a reduction in jobs - that is true - but they are on the public service side. So the member asking the question should not be seeking to mislead Australians and to pretend that the positions that the Minister for Defence has been referring to are positions that are in some way associated with patrolling our borders. The truth is and the truth remains that this government has more assets patrolling our borders than ever before. The member who asked the question has some expertise in relation to judging these issues, and he should use that expertise -                      The member who asked the question has some familiarity too with the complexity of dealing with asylum seeker questions. What the member, I think, should recognise on a fair reckoning is that the statement put out by me and the Prime Minister of Malaysia, a joint statement, is an innovative approach under a regional framework to a truly regional problem. When you are dealing with this problem, if you are not working regionally then anything you seek to do will ultimately come to nought. So we will continue to pursue our work as announced by the minister for immigration and me on Saturday, and I would counsel the member and the Leader of the Opposition that, amongst all the distortions they are currently engaged in with the Australian community, they do not add misrepresenting the defence position of this nation to the list.

  I thank the member for Page for her question and her ongoing commitment to infrastructure on the Pacific Highway. Like the member for Richmond and the member for Lyne, she has campaigned long and hard to make sure that we deal with this most vital of roads that has been identified by Infrastructure Australia as an absolute priority.                 Last night's budget provided additional funding of $1.02 billion for the Pacific Highway, bringing the federal government contribution to $4.1 billion over seven years. That compares with our predecessors who contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years of neglect. Indeed, if the former government had contributed at the same rate as this Labor government, the Pacific Highway would now be fully duplicated, finished, done and dusted. You would expect, as the member for Lyne and the member for Richmond and the member for Page and others have welcomed this announcement, that across the board this would get support. But, of course, we have an opposition that cannot read the budget papers and simply does not understand infrastructure. The member for Cowper has actually been out there saying that this is just a reallocation of funds, that there is nothing new there. The budget papers make it clear that of the $1.02 billion $270 million is a reallocation agreed between the government and the O'Farrell government and $750 million of that is absolutely new money. It is adding up to an additional 1.02 billion, and the clown over there, the shadow minister, just says, 'Oh, it's not. Forget about what the budget papers say.'                     I withdraw. It is now since 2009 that I had a question on infrastructure from the shadow minister opposite. So you have the local member for Cowper and when he goes and has a look at the work taking place - today more than a thousand workers are in place working on the Pacific Highway - and what is happening on the Kempsey bypass, well, maybe it's a mirage! Well, I tell you what: the incoming New South Wales government have built a viewing platform at the Kempsey bypass so they can look at our dollars at work, so they can look at our jobs taking place. The shadow Treasurer has gone further. The shadow Treasurer has said that this is just for planning and he cannot understand why it is just for planning. It is not. What it will do is enable construction to be brought forward including on the Frederickton to Eungai section, which is where the Clybucca bus crash happened all those decades ago. Two decades ago it happened, but it has taken this government to provide the funds. We provided $58 million for planning in 2009. Now we have provided an extra billion dollars to make sure that construction can be brought forward. This is a government that believes in nation building. This is a government that is delivering.

  I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question, because he has been a passionate advocate for his region, his patch of the great Australian economy that is in the Bendigo region. The budget rightly identifies Australia as an economy in transition, and of course if we are to meet the challenge of what that economy in transition means it does require us to look at the initiatives and the funding proposals that help us diversify the economic base. Also it is not just a question of getting the programs in place; it is essential that we get the delivery mode right. And the truth is that the budget also recognises that delivery must recognise the patchwork nature of the economy because it is giving greater emphasis to delivery through the lens of localism through the regions.                 As for the programs that are important, in addressing one of the key ingredients as to how we transition an economy, how we drive the economic diversity, it is skills development, because without the skills, without building the skills base, we run into a self-imposed constraint. Accordingly, the budget makes significant commitments to targeted incentives to develop the skills. It does it through the National Workforce Development Fund and it is complemented by significant initiatives that improve participation. It also identifies 16,000 places under the Regional Skilled Migration scheme. But if they are to work properly for the various patches, so if we are to get the patches working properly, we have to have the input at the local level that identifies what their needs are, where they identify what their skill shortages are and what their training needs are. They access these programs by a matching of skills required with skills supplied.                 That is why another pleasing dimension of this budget is the extension of the opportunity to local employment coordinators, in conjunction with the regional development network that we have established, to undertake skills audits so that regions themselves can best identify and match. The last time that this was effectively done it was done by a Labor government. It was done by a Labor government with me as the minister for education. That was when we introduced the area consultative committees whose task was to match supply with demand. This was a terribly effective program. When the others inherited office they kept the area consultative committees in name but never utilised them to their full capacity. They sent them off on a regional rorts program. The member for Indi would well remember one of those regional rorts because it was the cheese factory in her electorate that was on the nose, went bust - wasted money. But the truth is that we are going to go back to this successful model. This budget lays the foundation for it. We did it then and we will do it again. It will only happen under the stewardship of a Labor government.                     Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I thank him for raising the question of surplus, because it is indeed the issue for today. The government's budget on Tuesday night showed that the government will bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised. It shows that we have taken the tough decisions necessary to deliver the budget to surplus - they are there in the budget papers for all to see. Since the government launched the budget on Tuesday night, we have seen members of the opposition running around with completely contradictory claims. On the one hand, they criticise the government on the question of surplus; on the other hand, they oppose every cut in the budget. And, of course, we have the shadow Treasurer's representation that he could get the budget back to surplus one year earlier than the government.                 All of this charade, all of this mindless negativity, hits one big roadblock and decision point tonight. That is when the Leader of the Opposition gets to his feet to deliver his budget reply. He will walk into this chamber with no budget savings in his pocket. During the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition was out there claiming to the Australian people he had identified $50 billion of budget savings. As we know, Treasury said $11 billion of those savings were a big black hole. Indeed, one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition is not the Prime Minister today is that the Treasury found he was an $11 billion risk to the budget. The rest of the savings identified by the opposition were committed to expenditure programs. They committed them to the Australian people in the form of new expenditure during the election campaign.                  Let us just add up the maths. He said there were $50 billion of savings, $40 billion committed by him in new expenditure and $11 billion which was a big black hole. So the Leader of the Opposition will walk into this parliament tonight with no savings in his pocket. That means he has got only two options: he can identify savings, if he is going to criticise the savings of the government, savings that stand up to Treasury scrutiny, or he can endorse the government's budget. But what he cannot do is walk out of this parliament without having identified every number, every feature and every part of his budget strategy. He cannot do that.                 The leadership test that the Leader of the Opposition faces tonight is a very clear one. He has to make transparent to the Australian people every figure he relies on, every figure he says would bring the budget to surplus under his leadership. We know he has failed these tests shamefully and woefully in the past. We remember the farce of last year's budget reply when he delegated to the shadow Treasurer, who delegated to the shadow minister for finance in a press conference even his press secretary could not bear to watch. Tonight is the only opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition has to show that he is not a risk to the budget surplus, a risk to the cost of living of Australian families and a risk to the economy. We await the budget reply speech.

  I thank the member for Moreton for that very important question because I do want to update the House on April's employment numbers. The unemployment rate in April was steady at 4.9 per cent. These figures show that jobs were down in New South Wales and Victoria but they were strongly up in Queensland. Employment in Queensland is now higher than it was before the natural disasters. Today's figures build on this government's exceptional record when it comes to jobs. Since we came to office, the economy has created over 700,000 jobs. If we compare this to the rest of the world, we will see that there have been something like 30 million jobs shed elsewhere during that period. Just take the United States: the number of jobs in the United States is now seven million less than it was prior to the global financial crisis and the global recession, and of course their unemployment rates are very high, as they are across many other developed economies. Of course, the high rates of unemployment in those countries weigh heavily on their economies and produce high budget deficits and high debt.                 Here in Australia we have the benefit of a strong labour market and the benefit of an investment boom, which will continue to create jobs. As we have forecast in the budget, there will be a further 500,000 jobs in the next couple of years. That is 500,000 reasons why we need to invest in the skills and in the participation of our workforce - to going about reforming our training system; to making sure that we give people access to work experience, to capacity building and to a whole range of programs that will empower people to take up the opportunities that will come from the mining boom; to giving extra reward to sole parents; to making those training places available; to giving people more in the hand when they work another couple of hours. This has been endorsed by a number of commentators. This is what Craig James had to say about our plans:                 If there was one area crying out for attention it was the tight job market. And the good news is that the Government has taken action in a big way.                 Overall, it is a smart Budget, right for the times and challenges ahead.                 Or the Business Council of Australia:                 The skills package is a clear highlight of the Budget and will be good for the economy in helping to ensure that we can deliver major investment projects in years to come.                 Business is very much engaged in these challenges. We intend to work very closely with business and unions to ensure we lift our productivity, we train all of our people and we spread the opportunities of the boom right around the country because we do not want to leave people behind. These are very important objectives which will strengthen our economy for the future. From our perspective, the central core of what we must do here is to secure employment to create jobs to make sure that we continue to have a prosperous economy.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I agree with him that Australians do deserve a Treasurer with a steady hand, and they have one. They have a Treasurer who has delivered a budget that will return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised. When they look at the alternative, the shadow Treasurer, all of his claims, all of his mindless negativity, lands in a bundle at his feet tonight, because he has been wandering around saying that he could get the budget into surplus a year earlier than the government. So, if he is truly concerned about questions of debt and deficit, what he well knows is that to deal with debt and deficit you need to have a plan that gets the budget into surplus. We do.                  Now tonight is the opportunity for the shadow Treasurer to give the Leader of the Opposition a page of figures which explains his plan to get the budget into surplus 12 months earlier. We await that plan. What we know about the shadow Treasurer is that he has been alongside the Leader of the Opposition in some shameful, farcical exercises when it comes to trying to put figures together. We remember their flood funding package farce earlier this year, when they said to the government: 'Gee, we could get all of this together. It'd be easy. It'd be easy to find billions of dollars of savings to rebuild the nation. We wouldn't need a flood levy,' they said. 'We'll produce the figures.' When they produced the figures they degenerated into a week of internal chaos. Because they were so desperate for savings, they snatched up a One Nation email. We remember the election campaign when presumably the shadow Treasurer was involved with the Leader of the Opposition in generating their so-called costings for the election? We remember the $11 billion black hole the shadow Treasurer was no doubt -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about questions of budgeting, of debt, and I am responding to that question. I am particularly responding to what would have made circumstances for this country worse. And what would have made circumstances for this country worse, if we want to talk about questions of debt, is the shadow Treasurer's approach to accounting. He claimed in the election campaign that he had $50 billion of savings. He ran out and spent $40 billion of them and then, of course, Treasury found an $11 billion black hole. As I am advised, if we were pursuing the course that the shadow Treasurer recommended then there would be a deficit at the bottom of every year in the forward estimates in this budget. If the shadow Treasurer does not agree with that contention, he has a great opportunity tonight to give the Leader of the Opposition a page of figures which shows what they would cut to get the budget into surplus a year earlier, as the shadow Treasurer has said that they are able to do. If he cannot give the Leader of the Opposition that page of figures, he has failed the test of credibility. And if he does not give the Leader of the Opposition that page of figures, then the Leader of the Opposition will stand tonight before the Australian people as a risk to the budget surplus, a risk to their cost of living and a risk to our future economy.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that, as a great representative of her local community in this parliament, she is vitally concerned about making sure that, through the budget, we keep the economy strong. Mr Speaker, perhaps you did not hear it but when the Treasurer rose to answer the first question in parliament today, which was about the jobs numbers released today, the Manager of Opposition Business yelled out, 'What's this got to do with the budget?' and then repeated on a number of occasions, 'Why aren't you talking about the budget?'                  How could you be so out of touch with the lives of Australians? How could you be so divorced from the concerns of everyday Australians as to think that jobs were somehow not associated with the government's budget? The government's budget is all about jobs. It is about keeping the economy strong; it is about getting Australians the opportunity that they want and deserve to improve their own lives, to make sure that they can improve the lives of their children. That is what the budget is about. It is built on the foundation stone of having created 750,000 jobs - jobs created while many nations around the world ended up with unemployment rates of eight and nine and 10 per cent: millions of jobs destroyed by the global financial crisis as this government acted to protect Australian jobs.                 The government having created 750,000 jobs, this budget builds on that to create more jobs and more opportunity - another half a million jobs to be created in the next couple of years and a deliberate strategy to spread the benefits of opportunity throughout the Australian community. In order to do that we have to make sure that we are supporting Australians who are capable of work but who are not currently in the workforce into that workforce - responsibility and opportunity in one package so they too can experience the benefits of the current growth phase of our economy as our economy moves towards full capacity and the budget comes to surplus in 2012-13.                 As well as building a culture of opportunity for Australians who are currently beyond the workforce, we want Australians within the workforce to have better opportunities. That is what our $3 billion training package is all about. We also want to make sure we are supporting Australians with the services that Australians need today. We have acted to improve skills; we have acted to improve child care; we have acted to improve vocational education and training, universities, our health care system - and the list goes on. But in this budget particularly we are focusing on mental health because too many Australians confront mental illness, either their own or within their own family, with insufficient support. So we have put a priority on that. But we have done it all in the context of bringing the budget to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised. You can only do that if you show a tough approach and make the appropriate cutbacks.                 The opposition have condemned basically every cut the government has made. You cannot surplus budget and not make cutbacks. So tonight is decision-making night for the Leader of the Opposition. Does he endorse the government's budget or can he identify savings of his own? He walks into this room with no savings in his pocket. Let us see if they can get the job done.

  I really do thank the member for that question. I think it was a flick pass from Joe, because he said in the question that it was unstated in the budget papers that we were going to lift the borrowing limit. Those opposite had six hours in the budget lock-up to read the budget papers. It is very clear that after that six hours they were incapable of absorbing even the most basic information, because our intention to lift the borrowing limit has been flagged for a long time. It has been known in markets and it is there very clearly in the budget papers. Indeed, it is in budget statement 7 at page 18, but they could not find that. They could not read the budget papers. It was also in Budget Paper No. 4 at page 11, but after six hours they could not see it there.                 Despite the fact that it has been flagged , despite the fact that it has been talked about in markets, they then missed something else, because the Assistant Treasurer came into the House and announced it. He announced it in this House, following the budget speech, to everybody in the House and to everybody listening. He did it in the appropriate place; he did it in the appropriation bills. Despite all of that in here, in the bright lights, in the people's House, in the parliament, they even missed that. Then it went another 48 hours before they suddenly realised that we were increasing the borrowing limit. That just shows how incompetent, how out of touch, they have become.                      I am asked why. All of the reasons have been detailed in the budget speech and in the budget papers. I know that they do not do a lot of work, I know that they are pretty lazy and I know that they are pretty sloppy, but to make this sort of allegation they must have slept all the way through the global financial crisis and the natural disasters earlier this year, because what we have detailed and have been talking about for weeks and weeks is the impact of the natural disasters on the budget bottom line and the additional impacts of the global financial crisis and the global recession.                     There is nothing unusual about the government lifting the borrowing limit, nothing at all. I am going to cite an unusual authority who is backing us up on this. I am going to cite Senator Barnaby Joyce, who has already backed lifting the borrowing limit. It is just common sense. We are bringing our budget back into the black in 2012-13. We will pay down debt and we will also have a conversation with the Australian community, the parliament and the financial markets about what we will do in terms of a deep and liquid bond market. These are all questions associated with this very important part of economic management. There is nothing new about it. It has been known for ages. It was flagged in the mid-term review, it was in all the budget papers on budget night and it was announced to the House by the Assistant Treasurer, but those people opposite are so incompetent they know nothing about it.                     This is a supplementary question to the Treasurer and it follows on from his answer. What is the average interest rate that the government expects to pay on that debt?

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I am pleased to get a question on infrastructure from that side of the House even if it is from an Independent, because I cannot get one from the opposition over there, although I do note the shadow Treasurer's support for infrastructure where, perhaps, it will help roads to his farm up in North Queensland.                     I have had very productive discussions with the member for Kennedy on the infrastructure challenges facing North Queensland. I have visited with him places such as Karumba and Ingham, and indeed the site of the fantastic Ironsley River bridge, which was talked about for decades but fixed by this government as part of the economic stimulus plan. Indeed I will be back in Cloncurry with the member for Kennedy next Thursday, travelling with him through his electorate and looking at these infrastructure challenges firsthand. I can say to the member for Kennedy that Tuesday night's budget did in fact confirm transport infrastructure spending for Queensland of some $8.5 billion under the Nation Building Program - more than double what the former government did. Indeed it is more in half the time than they delivered in 12 years. The member referred to the Bruce Highway. The Bruce Highway is on the national network and it is consequently our primary funding priority for this region. We are now investing some $2.8 billion in the highway - $2.8 billion from us, $1.2 billion from those over that side of the House.                    And I thank the member for Herbert for his glowing endorsement when he acknowledged that this side of the House has delivered more than the former government did when it comes to the Bruce Highway.                 We are committed to improving road infrastructure in Northern Queensland. The McEwen Highway is of course an inland alternative to the Bruce. The member for Kennedy rightly points out it could be an important alternative freight route. As the member knows, Infrastructure Australia is currently developing a national freight strategy to look at these very issues. I know that the infrastructure coordinator, Michael Deegan, has travelled firsthand to this region to look at these issues, not just in terms of roads but also the energy issues, the water issues and the challenges facing this part of Far North Queensland. As part of the national freight strategy, they are consulting industry, the Queensland government and other stakeholders on the most effective freight routes. They will then provide advice on priorities and feasibilities.                 Also, as the member knows, we have established the Regional Infrastructure Fund to do just that - to give regional Australia their fair share back from the mining boom. One of the themes of our budget was everyone getting a fair share from the mining boom, spreading opportunity. We take our commitment to regional Australia very seriously indeed.                  I look forward to continuing to have dialogue with the Treasurer and the member for Kennedy. I look forward to seeing the member for Kennedy next week and to having a very pleasant chopper ride with him - in a confined space; lucky they give you earmuffs on the helicopter! But I look forward to that just next week.

  I thank the member for this very important question. The government is very serious about bringing our budget back to surplus in 2012-13, on time and as promised. This will be the quickest return to surplus that we have seen since these figures have been recorded. Of course, that involves the government taking some difficult decisions - something like $22 billion worth of savings in this budget. It means that there is very tight spending restraint - increasing spending by only one per cent a year over five years, compared to those opposite, who were increasing spending by something like 3.7 per cent a year over five years. So we will get the budget back to surplus as planned, and we are going to do that because we do not want to compound the price pressures in the economy which will flow from this very, very big investment pipeline.                  These facts have been noted by many commentators. Mr Davies, the economist from RBS, says:                  This is substantial turnaround and would be one of the biggest improvements in the Budget balance in the post-WW2 period.                  All of this is ignored by those opposite. They do not need to have any facts when they are analysing or critiquing public policy. They just go out there on mindless rants all the time - nothing positive to contribute to the debate.                 We have seen some commitments from the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer claimed during last week that he could bring the budget back to surplus next year. So we have done a bit of work on their commitments. We have had a good look at the starting point. We have seen what they have been saying about our savings. We have seen what they have been saying even about this budget. So we have had a comprehensive piece of work done as to where the budget bottom line actually is. That work was released by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation this morning and it shows that, if they were in government, on their current commitments they would be in the red to the tune of $20 billion in 2011-12 and again in the red, to the tune of $4.4 billion, in 2012-13.                 We have been listening to what they have had to say about the budget, and it has all been a bit confusing. One minute they are saying there should be more savings; the next minute they are saying there should be less. One minute they are saying the budget is too tough; the next minute it is not tough enough. They are in an absurd mess. They say they want to have less savings and more spending, and they then say they can come back to surplus even earlier. None of this adds up.                 Today is D-day for the Leader of the Opposition to demonstrate how he could bring a budget back to surplus or whether he is going to set out to wreck this surplus and compound price pressures in the Australian economy. If he did that, the Australian people would be the losers from that. What we should expect to see is a fully costed plan tonight. If he does not deliver a fully costed plan tonight, we will see what a risk he is to the economy and just how reckless those opposite are.

  Mr Speaker, that question just demonstrated why they refused last year to adhere to the Charter of Budget Honesty. Of course, last year we found, when all of their commitments were finally examined by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation, that there was an $11 billion hole in their savings. What they demonstrated there was gross incompetence, yet again.                 The member knows full well that this is an investment with a return and therefore we are perfectly entitled to account for this the way we have - and, indeed, we have accounted for it in full in the budget. It is all there for everybody to see - the nature of this investment and the size of this investment - and we do not apologise for it for one moment, because this is a critical piece of nation-building investment which will lift the productivity of our economy. It will be of particular benefit to those in regional areas. It will lower the cost of doing business. It will connect regional Australia - places like Mackay, Townsville and Gladstone - not just to the national economy but to the international economy, so there is a very strong case in economic terms for the investment that we are making.                 We should never forget that our investment in NBN is a very substantial microeconomic reform, a microeconomic reform that those opposite were not capable of implementing during their 12 long years of being in government and ignoring the problems. We had the guts to face up to structural separation, to make these decisions in the interests of the Australian people and to make the investments for the long term. I am not surprised you do not get it on the NBN, just like you did not get it in the middle of the global recession.                     You would have let small business swing. You would have seen Australian workers out of work. You simply do not get it when it comes to just about any area of national economic policy.                     We have accounted for the NBN in our budget papers and in our forecasts and in our projections in the same way the previous government would have accounted for it had it been in power right now. We are using the same rules. We are using the same officials. The same people are doing the forecasting. The same people who enforced the rules on the previous government are enforcing the rules on us. For the opposition to come into this House and try and discredit those approaches, which were ones that they used in government, just shows how reckless and how irresponsible they have become. They are just demonstrating yet again that they are not capable of managing a modern economy, which requires judgment and discipline. What we are getting is a reckless rant from those opposite, having a tantrum because they are in opposition.

  I thank my good friend the member for Banks for his question. This week's budget delivered the largest mental health package in our history. It is a balanced and a comprehensive package targeted across the life span. It is important to acknowledge that this was the result of the work of an expert group appointed by the Prime Minister to work intensively over the course of summer to develop the best directed, best targeted package possible. This group included well-known figures like Pat McGorry, Ian Hickie, Monsignor Cappo and Christine Bennett; consumer and carer representatives; and paediatric, GP and psychological experts, as well as Mission Australia and Employment Services Australia.                 It is perhaps not surprising, given that stakeholders largely designed this package, that they have warmly and overwhelmingly welcomed it. Frank Quinlan, the new head of the Mental Health Council of Australia, said:                 Today is a very good day for the mental health sector - increased investment, reform and better governance and accountability in mental health _                 I could read many other endorsements, but I will resist labouring the point.                 There have only really been two opponents to our package - the opposition and the AMA. The opposition has been out there suggesting, among other things, that this $2.2 billion is back ended. It is natural, of course, that transformative reform will involve an element of scaling up, but the parliament should be very clear that the two biggest injections of new money in this package are in year 1 and year 2, and the new money in year 5, out of the $2.2 billion, is just $50 million, about two per cent of the total package.                 The other voice of protest is the AMA. The recent evaluation of the Better Access program clearly showed that GPs have been getting paid over the odds under that scheme. For a referral consultation under Better Access, which data shows us takes on average 28 minutes, they have been getting $163. For a standard consultation under Medicare that lasts more than 40 minutes, a GP will get $99. That is two-thirds more money under Better Access for one-third less time. This budget brings the Better Access rebate back into line with a standard-time consultation under Medicare, but it still gives GPs a 27 per cent premium on top of that if they have done six hours of mental health skills training.                 In anyone else's book - maybe not the opposition's and maybe not the AMA's - that is a good deal. That is a fair deal for general practitioners. That is why this redirection has been supported by, among others, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian General Practice Network, Professor Patrick McGorry and Professor Ian Hickie. This package will make a real difference, and perhaps it is time that the opposition came in from the cold and got behind it.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She knows, as does this side of the House, that this budget is all about improving support for Australian families. We are delivering additional support for low- and middle-income families and, as I outlined yesterday, we are particularly adding support to families with teenagers. Next year in total this government will spend $32 billion on assistance for families through the Family Tax Benefit, through our child-care rebate, through the Baby Bonus, our new Paid Parental Leave scheme and our family support service.                  Of course, we know that we need to continue to look at different ways to improve support and especially providing that assistance for families who are doing it tough. One of the very important centrepieces of this budget is the way in which we are delivering both additional support and increased obligations for those jobless families and for teenage parents and especially targeting those areas of Australia where we know we have very high levels of unemployment. We want to give those families, especially those single parents and teenage parents, the extra support that they need to finish their education, to get the skills that they need so that they can get a job. We want them to get the most out of the economic opportunities that this country has to offer.                 The budget includes $40 million extra for Communities for Children, and that is a very important addition in support for families who are doing it very, very hard, especially in the most disadvantaged locations across the country. In these areas we are also providing additional child-care support so that families, particularly single parents and young mums, will be able to go back to school and get the additional training that they need so that they will get jobs in the future. The budget also includes an extension to the education tax refund to cover school uniforms, which I am sure will be widely welcomed by parents around the country.                 One of the areas that is very important in this budget for families who are under very significant pressure, families with children who have a disability or with children who have a mental illness, is that we are investing $500 million in new mental health services for those families where either their children or their young people are suffering from mental illness. There is also $150 million for those families who have a child with a disability. We want to make sure that those families get the support they need so that they can afford early intervention for their children with a disability.                  These are very significant reforms that have been widely welcomed by organisations like Family Relationships Australia, Uniting Care and Anglicare, all of whom recognise that this budget is all about putting families at the centre of this government's concern.

  These working families are valued by this government and they have been strongly supported by this government. Let us go right through that. Working families, particularly those with two incomes, have been the substantial beneficiaries of tax cuts three years in a row. Because they are relatively modest incomes, those tax cuts have been bigger for that family; they have been reasonably substantial for that family. They will also benefit from the modest increase that will come through paying the low income tax offset early. They will benefit from the fact that we increased the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. They may well be eligible for the addition of uniforms to the education tax rebate.                  I do not have all of the figures in front of me but I know one thing: families like that are very important to our nation and when they work hard they deserve to be rewarded. That is the reason we put in place the tax cuts. What I also know is that that family will be receiving very substantial benefit from the massive investments that we have put into health and into education over time - areas that were neglected by those opposite for a long period of time. Without the details in front of me I cannot know whether they will be affected by the pause at the top end, but what I can say to everybody in the House and what I can say to all Australians is that that pause will affect about two per cent of those who receive Family Tax Benefit.                  It was only last week that the shadow Treasurer was ranting and raving and saying that we should not be increasing Family Tax Benefit Part A for teenagers who are still studying. He went out and said that was reckless and irresponsible. This was a very important addition to the family payment system and it was opposed by the shadow Treasurer last week. So he cannot make up his mind what side he is on. One day he says we have not cut hard enough, the next day he says we are not tough enough, then he goes on and advocates additional spending; and the merry-go-round goes round and round. Then we have the Leader of the Opposition. He has supported pauses like this in the past. In fact, he has been hostile to these payments in the past. We on this side of the House have been very strong supporters of the family payment system. We recognise that parents who are bringing up children are doing the most important job in the country and that is why we are a strong supporter of the family payment system. Family Tax Benefit A, Family Tax Benefit B - we are strong supporters of all the childcare support and we have moved to considerably improve all of those benefits in our time in government.                 We know we have to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 and we know that if that does not happen price pressures in the economy will be compounded. If this Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck the surplus he will be responsible for price pressures which impact on families like those who were referred to by the member over there. Their reckless behaviour, their irresponsibility, their incoherence and their incompetence are on display for everybody to see.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Indeed, Labor set up Infrastructure Australia in 2008. It was one of our first pieces of legislation to overhaul the way that our nation plans and finances major infrastructure. The coalition, who are now bagging the initiative, did that at the time too. The shadow minister for infrastructure said at the time: 'I am concerned about the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. It is going to be a bureaucratic body that is going to spend time doing the work that has already been done.'                 That was their response in attempting to block this legislation. Well, Infrastructure Australia has become world's best practice. It has been copied in New Zealand, it has been copied in the UK and it has been copied, almost word for word, by the New South Wales government. We welcome the establishment of Infrastructure New South Wales and we look forward to Infrastructure New South Wales working with Infrastructure Australia.                 Of course, the work of reform is never done, and that is why in the budget we announced a reform package to strengthen IA and promote private and superannuation investment: 40 per cent more funding for IA; strong leadership and budget independence that reflects their independent advice; improvements to governance and transparency; a national infrastructure construction schedule; a post-build evaluation framework; best practice demand forecasts; and an investment tax incentive - asked for for years by the superannuation industry and the private sector and delivered by us - which will attract up to $25 billion of private sector investment to projects listed on the Infrastructure Australia priority list, encouraging the super industry to invest here in Australian infrastructure, not overseas. It will deliver more infrastructure at less cost to the taxpayer.                 These things are all good policy, and I flagged them when I went on the Sky program Australian Agenda on 3 April. I said that we would be boosting Infrastructure Australia's capacity, reappointing its chair and making a number of reforms. The Australian reported, as they do, on that program. They reported on the front page the next day. So I was surprised 10 days later that the Leader of the Opposition discovered infrastructure and released a speech, which I read about in the Australian, again, under 'Abbott's cost-benefit vow on infrastructure'. This is the same coalition leader who said that transport infrastructure is a state responsibility, full stop. It is the same Leader of the Opposition who said, when referring to engagement in urban infrastructure, that it was as silly as the state government having to 'buy new tanks for the army'.                  But Labor welcomes this new interest. You would think the Leader of the Opposition, having had three years to copy Labor's policy, to reverse his opposition to infrastructure, would do it properly, but he did not. We know from the Canberra Times that he did not even inform the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport about what he was going to say. We know this because it was reported. One of his own colleagues said:                 The shadow minister responsible for that particular portfolio was looking on in horror, completely unaware of what Tony was talking about.                 Another member of his team said:                 Things like that have been happening all the time.                 We will see what happens tonight. Will it be more mindless negativity from the Leader of the Opposition? My prediction is more mindless negativity. What do you reckon? I think that is probably the case, because they have been out there trying to lower expectations all day.

  We are supporting tradies in this budget and are absolutely proud of it. We are absolutely proud of supporting tradies in this budget. We have added to the $5,000 instant asset write-off an ability for people like that to write off the first $5,000 of the purchase of a ute. We are really proud of bringing in this initiative, but it will not happen if those opposite have their way because they are going to oppose it. The fact is that I know they are acutely embarrassed by that fact.                 No, I have not seen that analysis. I will have a look at it. The fact is that we have made some changes to fringe benefits taxation, but those people who are using their vehicles for work can fill out a logbook and there will be no change for them.

  I thank the member for his question. The fact is that this budget is about setting up Australia for the future, and education is a key component of this budget. We on this side of the House know that education is the great enabler. With education and training we develop our skills, we increase participation, we deliver productivity and we ensure prosperity. That is what this budget is all about. I am pleased to be able to outline some of the initiatives - $800 million worth - identified in this budget which will deliver important education reforms for Australia.                  This budget provides $425 million over four years for national rewards for great teachers. These rewards will foster the development of a nationally consistent performance management system for teachers for the very first time. From 2014, the top 10 per cent of teachers identified through this system will receive a bonus of up to 10 per cent of their salary. There is extra new funding in this budget, with some $200 million more in support for students with disabilities. This initiative is really important because we can now deliver therapy services, in-school training, teacher training and additional technologies to government schools, Catholic schools and independent schools that have kids with disabilities in their classrooms. I was especially pleased at the response that the government had to that initiative.                  There is $18.1 million for the Teach Next program. Here is an opportunity to create new pathways for teachers, particularly those with expertise in areas like maths and science. There is a $7 million investment in the development of an Australian baccalaureate, enabling Australian secondary students to acquire a credential of international standing - increasingly important in a globalised world. There is an additional $222 million in funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program. This will mean that an additional 1,000 schools, particularly schools in regional, remote and disadvantaged Australia, have access to chaplains. I did note that this was welcomed by the Australian Primary Principals Association. As well as that, from 2012, Indigenous students in regional and remote Australia will have access to the Indigenous Ranger Cadetship initiative. This will give those Indigenous students an opportunity to gain recognised qualifications and then gain work in the Working on Country Indigenous Rangers program, which is very successful around Australia.                  These reforms are supported by education stakeholders. The Business Council of Australia is congratulating the federal government for the leadership it is providing on school education reform. The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, the Australian Special Education Principals Association and the Parents Council are welcoming the More Support for Students with Disabilities Initiative. I did note that the Australian Special Education Principals Association said 'applause to the Gillard government'. They called it a huge step forward, and indeed it was.                  This government continues to deliver great reforms and solid investment to education, and that has been a hallmark of this budget. We do that on the back of record investment, nearly double what the coalition had spent, making sure that every kid in our schools in Australia gets access to a great education and that every school is a great school. So tonight the opposition leader has to tell us whether or not he will continue to maintain the $2.8 billion in cuts to education that the coalition have identified - cuts to teacher quality, cuts to students who are learning in low-SES schools, cuts across an education agenda that this government is delivering at this important time. Every child deserves the best education they can get. This government is delivering that education to every child.

  I do really welcome this question because the campaign that is being conducted by those opposite and some sections of the media about this matter has been inaccurate and irresponsible. Thirty-eight thousand have been installed. If there were some substantial problem here, given that they have been generally installed across the electorates of those opposite, we might have heard a peep about it. If something were going wrong we might have heard something about it from those opposite. We have heard nothing, because this is a program which has integrity. It is one that has been supported by those opposite. This is what the member for Mayo had to say about this on 25 May 2009:                  It is right that the government does help Australians, particularly those at the lower end of the income scale, to switch over to digital TV.                  What hypocrisy, what absolute hypocrisy. The costings that have been used and the way in which this has been approached have not taken into account that when these things are installed there is a service which goes with it. It is not just a question of the set-top box. I know there are members over there who are going into the homes of pensioners and who think they have got good value. But they are not speaking up for the pensioners of Australia. And we make no apology for supporting the pensioners of Australia with this important program because, if it were not there, too many of them would be left in the dark when the digital switchover happens. So this is a good program, it has a good social purpose, but once again it is being absolutely trashed by those opposite for base political purposes.                  Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Greenway for his question. I know that he and members, such as the member for Lindsay, work hard to represent Western Sydney in this place and they do a fantastic job.                     Sorry, I should have said the member for Chifley. Thank you to the shadow Treasurer for the correction and giving me the opportunity to congratulate another Labor member on representing his community and representing the interests of Western Sydney in this place.                  The member has asked me about infrastructure investments. Infrastructure investments are of course core to the budget that we delivered on Tuesday night - in transport, in broadband, in clean energy, in housing, in schools, in universities and in hospitals. I have been asked directly about investments in New South Wales and I want to make it very clear to the parliament that the federal government is delivering more funding in infrastructure to New South Wales than any other state. All up, New South Wales receives $12.1 billion through the Nation Building Program. One in every three infrastructure dollars goes to New South Wales, their fair share per capita and more than any other state. We have committed $3.5 billion directly to Sydney's transport network. Just in case anybody is asking themselves the question 'Which government has best delivered for Sydney's transport network?' I ask them to consider that $3.5 billion figure compared with the Howard government's investment of $350 million over 12 years. That is, we have spent 10 times as much in a third of the time.                  This budget allocates an additional $1 billion for the Pacific Highway. That brings our investment in the Pacific Highway to $4.1 billion compared to the Howard government's $1.3 billion. On the question of our commitment to infrastructure in New South Wales, I ask people to compare and contrast those figures. Of the $4.1 billion, new funding for the Pacific Highway is $750 million and in accordance with our usual partnership we are asking the New South Wales government to match this.                  There has also been money redirected from the M4 East. I know there has been some debate about this and I have been particularly surprised to hear Premier O'Farrell's claim about the M4 East. So let me advise the House of the following. First and foremost in relation to the M4 East money: this is Premier O'Farrell's contract with New South Wales - the commitments that he is going to keep - and there is no mention of the M4 East. Yesterday, in state parliament, the New South Wales Roads Minister said:                 The New South Wales Liberals and Nationals have been advised that the M4 East extension is not currently shovel ready and that further work is required to define the scope of the project, to complete the planning process and to carry out an environmental assessment, including consultation with the community.                 In other words, if we wanted to spend the $300 million, even if we wanted to extend this congested motorway, we could not do so. I have personally discussed this question with Premier O'Farrell and an arrangement has been reached between our two governments. So we will continue to work in a spirit of national interest with the New South Wales government. But let me say to Premier O'Farrell that I believe that spirit needs to be matched with a cooperative spirit on his side. He has said in the past that matters of infrastructure should be above party politics. We will stick to that standard and we look forward to Premier O'Farrell doing the same.

  I thank the member for his question. He might like to note that there was quite a significant arrest of a people smuggler in Sydney today, something that I anticipate will excite some public interest. I am sure the shadow minister, despite his complete negativity - because, like the Leader of the Opposition, what they do is mindless negativity - will want to congratulate the people who have worked hard on that.                     I just assumed that all members of the House would want to congratulate the police who have worked on this matter. They were the ones to whom my congratulations were directed. I understand that the member opposite may not join me in that but I am sure that many members of this House would congratulate the police on their work. Can I say in relation to the shadow minister's question that after arrests are made prosecutions have to follow. The Attorney-General's Department is working with the Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions to ensure appropriate resourcing for prosecutions of people smugglers and appropriate follow-up of cases. Clearly the shadow minister's question is directed to a budget measure where we are looking for efficiencies. We are looking for efficiencies across agencies, across the Public Service. I would remind the shadow minister, if he is in any way concerned about these things, that the savings that the Leader of the Opposition presented and then spent on other priorities during the election campaign actually had sharper cuts to public sector activity and presumably very sharp cuts, therefore, to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. We will continue, through the Attorney-General's Department, to work with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure rigorous people-smuggling prosecutions and, of course, the maintenance of effort on prosecutions under all Commonwealth laws.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. This government understands that Australia's migration settings are vital to our productivity and our economic growth. We also understand that skilled migrants who settle in regional areas make a particular contribution to the fast-growing regional and rural areas around the country - to their local businesses and to their economies. This is good for the regions and good for the nation. That is why, as well as a sensible increase in our skilled migration intake announced on Tuesday night, we announced important steps to ensure migrants are prioritised in regional areas, where they are most needed, growing the skills of the regions.                 In the last decade, we have seen a fourfold increase in the number of skilled migrants who settle in regional areas, and that is a good thing. But we need to do more. That is why we have announced an innovative new program of regional migration agreements - so that communities, employers, employees, local councils and unions can work together for a regional response to labour market needs. Regional migration agreements will include training requirements and local employment requirements so that we also continue to work to get more Australians into jobs. This will complement the government's $3 billion investment in major new skills initiatives announced by the Treasurer.                 Of course, governments have always made it clear - and this government has always made it clear - that we are committed to boosting Australia's skills base and ensuring that Australian workers get the skills they need as well, but skilled migration is an important part of our response to the shortages around the nation. We are also allocating 16,000 skilled migration places to regional areas through the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, a 60 per cent increase on the expected demand in the year 2010-11. We are taking steps to ensure that our temporary skilled migration program continues to play a vital role in supporting all businesses and resource projects with the announcement of enterprise migration agreements, another significant step forward announced on Tuesday night.                 So the government has taken a very sensible and responsible approach to skilled migration, which has been welcomed across the board by industry groups. The Minerals Council of Australia said:                 _ a lift in permanent skilled migration, the creation of enterprise or regional-focussed migration agreements and a streamlining of the processing of temporary skilled migration will help tackle immediate constraints.                 The Business Council of Australia said these are:                 _ sensible measures which add flexibility around temporary migration arrangements with relevance to business.                 So we know that this has been welcomed by third parties, by business groups, by farmers groups and by groups representing regional areas around the country. What we do not know is what the opposition thinks. We do not know what the opposition thinks, because we have not had much comment at all from the shadow minister for immigration about immigration settings. Call me old fashioned, but I would have thought the shadow minister for immigration might have something to say about the nation's annual immigration settings or about new initiatives like the regional migration statements or the enterprise migration agreements, but we have not a word. All we have had is our old friend the Leader of the National Party saying it is not enough, that there are not enough migrants going to regional areas. He has not outlined how much more they would increase migration by, what more they would do or how they would change our initiatives on regional migration statements. All we get in the space of immigration policy from this opposition are three-word slogans. When it comes to big decisions, like how much to increase the migration intake and whether we should encourage more people to live in regional areas, we hear nothing, not a word, from the shadow minister for immigration, the walking sound bite himself. When it comes to substance, we get nothing.                 There is an opportunity tonight for the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply to put some substance on the table and show us not only his savings but how he would return the budget to surplus. He proposes to oppose our cuts and our savings while returning the budget to surplus. How is he going to do it? And what is he going to do about immigration?

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that I am well aware that he and his spokesperson, the shadow minister, have been out playing politics on this. We all know, of course, that they are not interested in the policy, because, if they were interested in the policy, presumably they would be supporting an inquiry that looked at not only detention now but also detention under the Howard government and that looked at, for example, the breakout from Woomera. Do we remember that? Perhaps it could look at the incarceration of an Australian, Cornelia Rau. Do we remember that? Perhaps it could even traverse the children overboard affair and the deliberate misleading of the Australian people at an election.                 As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, the government has been very transparent about circumstances in detention centres. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is: before he throws around words, he ought to acknowledge, for example, that incidents are of course catalogued and they can range from something like a very simple health complaint by an asylum seeker through to something more serious.                 In relation to incidents in detention centres, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has ordered inquiries. They are publicly known, and the opposition has the opportunity in Senate estimates to ask any questions that it genuinely has on the policy. But what I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that at some point he has to work out whether he is only interested in the politics of this or whether he is interested in the policy. If he is genuinely interested in the policy, he may want to let us know. But, as we know from characterisations by senior members of his own frontbench, policy is not his strong suit.

  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Chifley for his question - although it does now seem some time ago. His question was on a very important topic, namely climate change, and the important report by the Climate Commission that came out today entitled The critical decade. That is an important title, because in this report we have climate scientists confirming that climate change is real and that action is needed on climate change. This is a report that has been extensively reviewed by a range of expert climate scientists, including the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. Will Steffen, who worked on this report, has also been working with Ross Garnaut and his team as they have undertaken an update of the climate science.                 This report shows that between 2001 and 2010 the global average temperature was nearly half a degree higher than the average temperature from 1961 to 1990. That makes it the warmest decade on record. As the sea is forced to absorb more carbon dioxide it is becoming more acidic, with a 15 per cent decrease in calcification rates over the past two decades which affects natural icons like the Great Barrier Reef. On the west coast of Australia, sea levels have risen by more than a centimetre per year since the 1990s. Around two-thirds of that rise has come from increased sea temperatures and melting ice caps. With rising sea levels come risks of extreme weather events. A sea level rise of only half a metre by the turn of the century can lead to very different risks for different seas. In Sydney or Melbourne's coastal areas, for example, a once-in-100-years extreme weather event could happen almost monthly.                 This is very important information and I am not at all surprised by some of the jeering that has broken out on the other side, because senior members of the coalition, like Senator Nick Minchin, have come out against this report and confirmed their climate change denial. We know that the Leader of the Opposition stays in climate change denial, which is why he is prepared to go around and front a scheme that the member for Wentworth has rightly said cannot work and would be hugely costly. They are the actions of someone in climate change denial. We would say to the Leader of the Opposition that he should be pursuing the example of conservatives that are trying to lead for the future, like Prime Minister Cameron in the United Kingdom, who has announced very deep cuts in carbon pollution and who has said that this will position the UK as a leading player in the global low-carbon economy, creating significant new industries and jobs.                  This report confirms that climate change is real, that to tackle climate change we must cut carbon pollution, and that the most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. I am determined and the government is determined that we will do just that. We will not succumb to the Leader of the Opposition and his team's climate change denial nor will we follow him down the path of a costly scheme that cannot work. We will price carbon. It is a critical decade and it is a critical year for those who believe in climate change.

  I say to the member who asked the question - a member who is known for playing politics in this area rather than anything associated with the policy, most graphically demonstrated when he played politics with the funerals of asylum seekers - that we are working with Malaysia on an innovative transfer agreement. As part of that transfer agreement, we would bring to Australia people who are genuine refugees, who are processed in Malaysia and who are already there now and are waiting a resettlement opportunity. The processes we would go through would be comparable to the processes we go through when we take other refugees in other parts of the world under the humanitarian -                      My recollection is that the quote that the shadow minister is using is a statement that I made when I was asked about the selection of people under the humanitarian intake to come here, but I am happy to describe both parts of the arrangement. As I was saying before the Leader of the Opposition took his point of order, in terms of our increased humanitarian intake, the shadow minister would be aware that we take humanitarian intake from around the world. We have processes to do that. We are looking to increase our humanitarian intake. I know that there are some days when the opposition opposes that; there are some days when they are prepared, in pursuit of political deals, to offer to double the humanitarian quota, with the $3 billion cost that that would imply. That was the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition in the lead-up to government being formed.                 On the issue of the asylum seekers to be returned, we are working with Malaysia on the transfer agreement. Its aim is to break the people-smugglers' business model. As I have said to his House before, I am not ruling in or ruling out arrangements in relation to that 800. But the message to people-smugglers is clear: if you risk coming here on a boat then the risk that you run is that will end up in Malaysia at the back of the queue. I say to the opposition that there does come a point at which their playing of politics with this is genuinely destructive to the national interest. They ought to contemplate what they are doing as they approach that point.

  Credible climate scientists around the world have been telling governments for some time that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The government respects the scientific advice. A new peer reviewed report out today from the Climate Commission - and the Prime Minister referred to this report in an earlier answer - summarises the latest science and makes clear that climate change is happening faster than previously thought.                 The report's central message is that the next 10 years are critical in our efforts to deal with this significant economic and environmental challenge. The report spells out significant risks to human health, to agriculture, to cities, to infrastructure and to natural heritage from the more severe climate impacts over the longer term. Importantly, so that people can see this clearly, it sets out the evidence pertinent to the warming of the atmosphere, the sea level rises that are being experienced and the risks to icons like the Great Barrier Reef. The report concludes that an economic transformation is needed to achieve the reductions in carbon pollution we need to avoid severe impacts from climate change.                 The report and its findings were welcomed today by the shadow minister for climate action, the member for Flinders, who said in a media release: 'There is bipartisan support in Australia in support of the science of climate change, as presented in the report.' The problem for the member for Flinders is that he does not have a policy to deal with the threat that climate change represents. The report's findings make it clear that direct action measures, so-called, which rely almost entirely on tree planting and soil carbon, are not a credible way to tackle climate change.                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                     So-called direct action measures, which rely almost entirely on tree planting and soil carbon, are not a credible way to tackle climate change, according to this report, and yet the Leader of the Opposition today in the media claimed otherwise. He never lets facts get in the way of a fear campaign. What is needed is a carbon price, as advocated by the government, to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. They are still a rabble over there on this issue and on the science in particular. In total contempt for the shadow minister's stated position on the climate science, Senator Minchin has been out today speaking for the climate science deniers, and he had this to say:                   The so-called Climate Commission is                    a Labor government-appointed committee of known climate alarmists, selectively appointed -                      The Leader of the Opposition is saying it is true. We just heard from the shadow minister that there is bipartisan support here. Senator Minchin goes on to say:                   _ selectively appointed to further the cause of global warming alarmism.                 And of course Senator Minchin, who owns the Leader of the Opposition who installed him, wrecking action on climate change - a noted climate science denier - is the one who thinks it is a communist conspiracy.                 We have had the member for Tangney out today as well. He said the following this morning: 'Over the last 10 years there's been no increase in the globe's temperature.' It just so happens that that contradicts the findings of the World Meteorological Organisation, NASA and the CSIRO. Facts cannot get in the way of fear in this important issue and it is time the Leader of the Opposition took public policy responsibility and took the credible science seriously.

  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question and I welcome the opposition's new-found interest in the rights and protection of asylum seekers in Australia. I refer the honourable member for Bennelong to the commitments made by the Prime Minister of Malaysia in the joint statement with the Prime Minister of Australia, which indicated that asylum seekers would be treated with dignity and respect if they were processed in Malaysia. I also refer the honourable member to my numerous public statements that the negotiations on the operational details are continuing with Malaysia and that the government will be providing further information as those negotiations are completed.                 I also bring the honourable member's attention to the statements by the UNHCR, both in Geneva and Australia, that this arrangement represents a significant step forward and presents the opportunity to improve protection for asylum seekers throughout the Asia-Pacific region. I understand the frustrations of the opposition, who are willing this arrangement to fail. I understand that the opposition are devastated that the government has reached an international agreement to break the business model of the people smugglers at the same time as we are increasing our humanitarian intake. I understand their sensitivity, but they will be disappointed as we continue to implement this innovative and bold arrangement.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I am aware that the Dalai Lama is visiting next month. He is a frequent visitor to Australia in his capacity as a religious leader and also as a Nobel laureate. We welcome him on this visit. I know he has an active program around the country. As I believe members of the House are likely to be aware, representatives of successive Australian governments have met with the Dalai Lama unofficially and privately. This is very much a reflection of Australian community expectations. I expect on this visit that members of the House and members of the government will have similar opportunities to meet him. As to my own plans, at this stage I do not have a meeting scheduled with the Dalai Lama. Any such decision will be taken closer to the time.

  I thank the member for that very important question. This is a very important report. It points to the fact that we do need to act on climate change, that we need to reduce our carbon pollution, if we want to have a prosperous economy and if we want to grow sustainably into the future and create the jobs that we require for our children and for our grandchildren.                 Dangerous climate change will have a dramatic impact not just on our environment but on our economy. This has been demonstrated by report after report. It was demonstrated first and foremost by the Stern report many years ago and then demonstrated by the Garnaut report and again demonstrated today. We on this side of the House absolutely understand that the costs of inaction on climate change are far greater than the costs of action. We understand that. We understand that the only growth strategy for the future is a growth strategy which puts in place lower carbon pollution. That is the only sustainable way forward to continue to create jobs. To do this, and to put in place a price on carbon, it means that we get investment in the renewable energy of the future. But to do all of this you need to have a clear economic vision for our future. This government does have a clear economic vision for our future, but unfortunately those opposite have no such vision whatsoever. That was on display in this House when the Leader of the Opposition gave his non-budget reply. It was on display again at the Press Club when we had that appalling performance from the shadow Treasurer only last week. It was probably the worst in history from a shadow Treasurer at the Press Club.                 What we know is that this is all about something far deeper than their incapacity to put forward an alternative economic policy; it is about the fact that the Leader of the Opposition denies the science of climate change. That is absolutely at the core because this Leader of the Opposition will not make the hard decisions. This Leader of the Opposition is unwilling and incapable of facing up to the big decisions our country needs to make - whether it is bringing our budget back to surplus, taking action during a global recession or dealing with dangerous climate change. He is absolutely incapable of making those hard decisions because what he wants to do is the politically opportunistic thing and not the right thing by the country.                     I was asked about the consequences of not taking action. We on this side of the House are determined to take action and, of course, the wreckers opposite are going to try to stop us taking the action which goes to the very core of economic prosperity in this country. Of course, they are doing that because the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in the science. His puppeteer and the man who installed him in his job, Senator Minchin, was out there today making it clear that the Liberal and National parties do not believe the science of climate change.                 There are some on the other side who do believe in the science of climate change and do understand its importance to a prosperous economy. We had the member for Wentworth completely repudiate the Leader of the Opposition on this question last week, but he is so incapable of making a tough decision that he could not even discipline the member for Wentworth. He could not do any of that because what we have is a Leader of the Opposition who will not face up -                      As I move around the community, Australians say to me: 'Please take some action on dangerous climate change. It is a threat to our future.' It is not a threat understood by any of them over there because at their core they are all climate change deniers.

  The honourable member's question suggests that the government has a regional reputational difficulty on this matter. Having just been in the region, let me tell you that those opposite, during the period that they were in office, did not just have a problem of regional reputation - there was an absolute foreign policy disaster in the region through the actions on the part of the Indonesian government at the time, under President Megawati, to open the doors because those opposite did not know how to manage the relationship with Indonesia, and on and on it went.                 From those opposite there was also the extraordinary spectacle on the eve of the election, which the Prime Minister just referred to, when the country was absolutely misled on the question of children overboard. Let it not be forgotten that those opposite collectively stood by when one of their senior ministers went to the Australian people and delivered a fundamental untruth to them - and they know it. One other thing that those opposite failed to deliver during their period in office was any regional processing agreement. The shadow foreign minister asks what has been engaged by my portfolio in support of the work done by the immigration minister. Let me tell her: through the work that we have taken most recently in the Bali process, for the first time there is now a regional framework agreement which can be applied to all countries within the region. Secondly, for the first time it contains within it a provision for regional processing centres. Thirdly, it contains within it the buy-in of the International Organisation for Migration.                     Fourthly, it contains within it the buy-in of the UNHCR. Mr Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked what we have been doing on the question of regional countries. Let me tell you: that framework was concluded and agreed with myself and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in Bali just several months ago. It is on that basis that we are engaged in subsequent bilateral engagements.                 In their many years in office, not one single element of progress was made in concluding such a regional processing agreement, which is why they earned the comprehensive condemnation of the UNHCR and other agencies in the humanitarian field across the world. We have engaged the international community, the international organisations, as was all regional states. Look at the statement which was produced out of that conference in Bali. That is what our portfolio has been doing. That represents a fundamental change from what her government achieved in the past.

  I thank the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, for his question. It is a great question which enables me to inform the House of some very good news. The budget, of course, was all about jobs and opportunities for Australians, because for people in this country having the benefit of work is a fundamental part of being sure that you can make a life for yourself and your family. To get that all-important job, then be able to get the next job and a better job requires that people have access to opportunity. Since the budget, we have been talking about the budget's measures to spread opportunity to people who have been locked outside the benefits and dignity of work; the budget's measures to spread opportunity through enabling Australians, young and old, to upgrade their skills through our $3 billion investment in skills.                 These policies build on reforms that this government has already delivered, most particularly reforms in education. Today I want to focus on the reforms in our university system - another way we are spreading opportunities to Australians. This morning I visited the University of Canberra, where I met a number of students who are benefiting from our youth allowance reforms. We have seen a 23 per cent growth in the number of undergraduate places since 2009.                     I would have thought that were something that every member of the parliament could celebrate: more students having an opportunity to get a place at a university. I would have thought that would receive shared congratulations. That means 23 per cent more people are having the benefit of that kind of opportunity.                 When we look at youth allowance, we see an extra 21,000 university students are now receiving youth allowance. In just 12 months, the number of dependant students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving the maximum youth allowance student payment has increased by 108 per cent - it has more than doubled. The number of regional and rural students receiving student youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent. For those who genuinely care about the fortunes of rural and regional students, that is good news. In total, more than 107,000 young people have benefited because they are now receiving youth allowance the first time or because they are receiving more in their payment. More than 36,000 of these young people are from rural and regional areas. Once again, that is something I would have thought would be received as good news. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of regional and rural students receiving dependant youth allowance. In the past 12 months more than 240,000 university students have received start-up scholarships, with 55,000 of those students coming from rural and regional areas, and 36,000 students have received relocation assistance, which has of course gone to students from rural and regional areas too.                 For those who care about opportunity in our society, for those who care about turning around the trend under the Howard government of the participation rate of rural and regional kids in university going down, the good news is we have turned that trend around and participation is going back up. That is a great thing for rural and regional Australia. It is a great thing for those who celebrate a fair distribution of opportunity in our society.

  I thank the member for his question and I understand that the member who asked the question would be struggling today. He is a man who wrote a thesis on why an emissions trading scheme and pricing carbon was the most effective way of dealing with carbon pollution. Since then he has sold his soul and pretended that the direct action measures of the Leader of the Opposition can work. Of course, today, the shadow minister opposite has crashed right into this report that verifies that climate change is real and verifies that we cannot take meaningful action on climate change without reducing the amount of carbon pollution. That is, the coalition direct action plan to sequester carbon in various forms is not enough.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My point in going to this report is that it verifies that climate change is real. It also verifies that to tackle climate change you need to cut carbon pollution and that, so-called, direct action measures are not enough. If you are going to cut carbon pollution the most efficient way to do that is to put a price on carbon. The shadow minister who asked the question actually knows that. Of course, putting a price on carbon does drive a change in our economy. It is meant to drive a change in our economy, as we put a price on carbon businesses that are big polluters then innovate and change to reduce carbon pollution. Of course we want to see carbon pollution reduced and that is what pricing carbon is all about.                 We will work with Australian industry and business to protect Australian jobs, which is what the roundtables that the minister for climate change has been running are about, by working directly with Australian industry. In terms of job prospects for the future, what the shadow minister would know if he was being forthright with the parliament is that we cannot afford, in jobs and prosperity of Australians, to have our economy fall behind the standards of the world. There is a reason that we have to transition our economy. If we do not transition our economy we will miss out on the clean energy jobs of the future.                 I say to the shadow minister, given his membership of the Liberal Party, that he is probably more likely to look to David Cameron on these questions than he is to any member of the Labor Party, and I would suggest to him that he does. Prime Minister Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - who, if he were in this country, would be the holder of a Liberal Party ticket - is driving deep cuts in carbon pollution in his economy because of his view that it is positive for the jobs of the future and positive for employment growth in the United Kingdom.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about jobs and pricing carbon and I am talking about jobs and pricing carbon. I say to the shadow minister that, rather than go out and politically look for fear in this debate, he should take the same course as conservative Prime Minister David Cameron who is out there with deep cuts to carbon pollution and is saying to the people of the United Kingdom that he supports those changes because he supports responsible government and he supports jobs growth in his economy. The shadow minister should actually be honest with the Australian people about that.                     Mr Speaker, if members of the opposition find the suggestion that they should be honest offensive, I withdraw it.

  I thank the member for Greenway for that very important question. I spent last week travelling around the country talking to businesses and to families about the importance of bringing our budget back to surplus and, of course, keeping our economy strong. I particularly enjoyed my visit to Cumberland Ford in Sydney, where I spoke to the workforce and to a group of very good, ambitious and hard-working young apprentices. In particular I met with Justin Poore, who is in the NRL with Parramatta, and another very impressive apprentice by the name of Justin James, who had just won the Ford apprentice of the year for the whole of the country. I spoke to them about the importance of having a better trained workforce and the importance of improving our apprenticeship system, particularly retention in the apprenticeship system. As I moved around the country I spoke to communities right across the country about the importance of better healthcare, the importance of better education and the importance of investing in mental health. I spoke to them about all of these things and, of course, doing all of those into the future is only possible if you can bring the budget back to surplus, and bring it back to surplus in 2012-13, so we do not compound the pressures that will come from the mining boom. It is very important we do not compound those pressures when that investment pipeline hits top gear. This is the quickest return to surplus on record. This is what Tim Toohey from Goldman Sachs has had to say about the government's fiscal policy: 'represents the biggest fixed fiscal contraction since 1970 when comparable data commenced.' This was highlighted in the Reserve Bank board minutes, which were published last week: 'members also noted the prospect of significant domestic fiscal consolidation over the next couple of years.'                 Bringing the budget back to surplus is all hard work. Hours and hours are spent in the ERC doing the really tough grind of expenditure restraint, something not done by those opposite when they were in power, when they went on a spending spree at the height of the mining boom mark 1. There was no expenditure restraint during that period. We all know what happened then: 10 interest rate rises in a row from those opposite. We had the budget reply this week from the shadow Treasurer, where he proved there was no plan whatsoever to keep the economy strong, there was no plan to return to surplus, despite the fact he had told everybody the week before that we could come back to surplus next year. There was no demonstration of that and he could not offer a single alternative saving. So what we have is a federal opposition that has no alternative economic policy, none whatsoever. We have a Leader of the Opposition who gave a speech in this House that barely mentioned jobs and a shadow Treasurer who went to the Press Club and maybe mentioned them once. Both of them did not mention the floods or their impact on our economy at all, which just shows how unqualified they are to assess our economic situation, let alone to do the hard work that we need to do to make sure our budget comes back to surplus so we can maximise all of the opportunities that will flow from the mining boom. They are simply incapable of doing the hard work. They are not up to the job. They are totally incompetent.

  I thank the member opposite for his question. In response I would advise him to talk to the clubs about which he is talking about the record levels of investment that this government has put into both infrastructure, something that he is not prepared to ask questions about, and also sports funding with a record increase to ensure these clubs are supported at a level they never have been before.                     In response to that I am quite happy to once again outline to the opposition the facts of why the government is acting on this and the process that we are going through. We are working with the multiparty committee to both work through the details of what a price on carbon will look like as well as look at assistance arrangements. Perhaps, rather than going out and scaring clubs in this community and in the community more broadly, he might want to get on board and work productively with us and with the other members of this parliament who are at the moment taking seriously our responsibility to act on climate change, which we know is real and we know must be addressed.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. She understands the importance of the mining industry in Western Australia and perhaps more importantly cooperative Commonwealth-state relations. Last week, for the second time since it was elected, the Barnett government has substantially increased iron ore royalties without any consultation with industry. This represents a major challenge to the future growth of the mining industry in Western Australia. It also represents a major challenge to the whole Western Australian community.                     There are a number of key issues that go to those concerns. Firstly, the truth of the matter is that by its decision the Western Australia government may have created an outcome that means it has kicked an own goal. The outcome of the increase in royalties has sent a very strong message to the Commonwealth Grants Commission that the WA economy has a huge capacity to actually increase its revenue. In essence, we could end up with a situation by which the Western Australian government could very likely lose more in GST revenue than it gains in additional royalty payments. Despite that, we remain committed to the independent review of Commonwealth Grants Commission arrangements, which we have already announced in cooperation with the Western Australian government.                 I turn now to the issue of the Western Australian mining industry. We remain committed to our undertaking to the mining industry to credit royalties. In that context, the challenge for the Western Australian mining industry is that the second increase in royalties is paid by mining companies in Western Australia, which are paid in both good times and bad times. For the small end of the mining industry in Western Australia, I remind the House that very few of them, under the MRRT, will actually pay a dividend to the Commonwealth because we are only taxing super-profits. For those companies, therefore, there is nothing to be credited in terms of the operation of the MRRT. They will bear the full impact of the increase in mining royalties, the second increase put in place by the Western Australian government since it was elected.                 I turn now to the issue of infrastructure spending. The Commonwealth government stands by its commitment to increase infrastructure spending in Western Australia, especially the Gateway project, which goes to a potential huge improvement in productivity because of the problems around the Western Australia airport not only for the mining industry but for the whole of the Western Australian economy, including the all-important tourism industry. The only potential reduction in infrastructure spending will arise from a potential decision by the WA government not to spend its increase in royalties on infrastructure spending in Western Australia - because, in essence, you cannot reduce the Commonwealth take, which was going to be spent on infrastructure, and then expect the same revenue stream to be spent on Western Australian infrastructure in the future. I encourage the Western Australian government to do what the Commonwealth was going to do out of the MRRT - substantially increase infrastructure spending in Western Australia.                 I also want to raise the all-important question of the underlying assumptions of the budget. If you actually examine the Western Australian budget proposition in terms of the impact on the Commonwealth budget it is just plain wrong because the assumptions are entirely different. We will be able to maintain our surplus and meet all our commitments for small business infrastructure spending - and, I might say, our capacity to increase superannuation - as a result of the introduction of the MRRT and the PRRT. What amazes me is the deafening silence from the opposition about the revenue grab by the Western Australia government.; it borders on hypocrisy. During the course of last year they walked up and down St Georges Terrace, led by the member for Curtin, taking every donation they could get and promising to oppose increases in mining tax.

  I thank the member for Groom for his question. Of course, the member for Groom is the person who, before the last election, verified that, whoever formed government after the election, electricity prices were going up. He was speaking frankly to the Australian people about underinvestment in infrastructure and the fact that investment in infrastructure needed to occur. He said that was going to flow through to consumers and it was nothing to do with a price on carbon. He told people the truth then; I hope he is prepared to continue to do that.                 On the question of the statements by the CEO of TRUenergy, I and the government are very conscious of the need for certainty in short- and long-term carbon pricing to send the right signals for investment in long-lived assets - and, of course, electricity generation necessarily involves long-lived assets. That is why we are working on carbon pricing and will announce full details of the scheme in the middle of the year so people can see what is being proposed with certainty. What the CEO of TRUenergy stated yesterday - and it is very clear - was this:                 The industry has actually been very supportive of an emissions trading regime and lots of us within the industry operate in other jurisdictions that have an emissions trading regime.                 That is, the CEO of TRUenergy was out there, working as he does in a sector that makes long-lived investments, understanding the need for an emissions trading scheme - and, of course, we will get to a full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme following a fixed-price period. He then specifically rejected the view that a so-called direct action policy would be sufficient to transform the energy sector - and that, I think, is a very important piece of information for the House.                 Now, who else has been telling us about so-called direct action over the last seven days? Well, it is none other than the member for Wentworth, who went on national television and verified that, effectively, this is the scheme you have when you are really a climate change denier; it cannot work and it will cost Australians $18 billion. We know that, in 2020, the impact on Australian families will be $720 per year.                     I was asked about comments by the CEO of TRUenergy, carbon pricing and electricity. Let me conclude with this. Having given consideration to the view of the CEO of TRUenergy about emissions trading - maybe the members of the opposition do not like the facts, but these are the facts - I say the following: we need to send a certain price signal to those in electricity. That is what we will do with carbon pricing. Our carbon pricing scheme will meet what Australians want. They want effective action on climate change and they want assistance with their cost of living pressures.                 The scheme proposed by the Leader of the Opposition will do the direct opposite - no effective action on climate change and a direct cost to Australian families with no assistance and a worse cost of living. We will keep working with Australian families and we will get this job done.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As the budget makes clear in this year's economic outlook the Chinese economy, together with the other emerging economies of Asia, is expected to drive strong demand for Australian exports in the future, which is good for Australian economic growth and good, also, for Australian jobs.                 This is reflected in some of the profound changes we have seen occur in the Chinese economy over the last 20 years or so. It is worthwhile the House paying attention to one or two of these key facts. The first is this: 20 years ago - in 1990 - the Chinese economy was the same size as ours; right now China has the second largest economy in the world. Sometime within the next decade, or the one following that, China will be the largest economy in the world. In terms of its impact on global merchandise exports and imports China is now the world's largest merchandise exporter and the world's second largest merchandise importer. But what is really important to Australians and Australian businesses is that when it comes to the future of the commercial services sector the Chinese economy is also growing apace. In 2010 China became the fourth largest exporter of commercial services in the world and the third largest importer of them as well.                 These are profound changes coming out of the Chinese economic growth model and they are being driven so much by China's emerging cities. Six provinces, by 2020, will have provincial economies larger than US$1 trillion each and we will have 93 Chinese cities, each with populations of 5 million or more. These are rewriting the history of the global economy as we progress through the 21st century. For Australia and our exporters this has profound implications. China is already our largest trading partner - $100 billion - and I say to those opposite that they should bear in mind the fact that Australia's trade with China has doubled since 2007. This is important for Australian jobs.                 There are profound policy changes underway in China right now. The previous growth models, which depended on exports and labour-intensive manufacturing, are changing to new growth models, which are based on domestic consumption, quality growth and environmental services as well as the importance of the services sector more generally. This is the change which we are categorising as China 2.0 because it has big implications for the future of Australian exports to China: financial services exporters, construction services, architectural services, green design, environmental services - areas where we have such great strength, including education and tourism services.                 Australian exporters must begin to work through the implications that this has for their future export strategies in China. Over the weekend I was with 200 or 300 Australian business representatives in Guangzhou. We have 700 Australian companies in southern China. Australian business needs to be right across this country in the future, and in the major emerging cities that I referred to before. The trade minister and I will be taking this message out to the Australian business community in order to make sure that it is aware of these new opportunities in the services sector and in the major new cities of China as well.                 Later in the year the trade minister and I will take a delegation to China to prosecute those interests on the ground. I say to this House that these are profound changes for the global economy and for Australia and we have to be in it to win it.

  I thank the honourable member not only for her question but for her very proactive engagement in this issue. On 4 April this year the member for Newcastle telephoned me to express her concern about some issues around settlement services and housing for refugees in Newcastle. I told the honourable member that I would arrange an independent investigation and asked her to put those concerns to me in writing to enable that investigation.                 I received the honourable member's letter the next day, and Ernst and Young were engaged to undertake the review on 12 April. I have received the findings of the investigation conducted by Ernst and Young, and I released them publicly a short time ago. They do not make for pretty reading. Ernst and Young's investigation identified that a number of humanitarian clients had been adversely affected by substandard service delivery by the service providers in the Newcastle region, a consortium led by Navitas English and including accommodation services provided by Resolve FM. The report identifies some instances of substandard housing, rental charges not necessarily related to market conditions, inappropriate charges for property damage and poor quality household goods, and identifies that there have been less than healthy relations between service providers and local community groups. I have instructed my department to undertake immediate action in response to the findings of the report and I am receiving regular updates. Certain claims have already been referred to the New South Wales Police.                 The report also raises concerns regarding the department's management of its service providers in Newcastle and recommends a more active and involved approach to contract management to mitigate the risks of inadequate service delivery in the future. I have asked the department to audit all refugee housing across the country to ensure that the issues identified in Newcastle are not more widespread. I have also asked Professor David Richmond to conduct an independent review on the adequacy of the performance measures and framework as well as the department's contract management processes for the new settlement services contracts. In addition, I have asked the secretary of my department to consider whether any departmental staff were in breach of their obligations under the APS code of conduct as set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act.                 The Ernst and Young report also makes observations about the financial management of some of the service providers. In light of those findings, a detailed forensic audit is to be undertaken of Resolve FM's financial management under the Hunter region contract. I have asked for this audit to take place urgently, and the department will take further action on any matters that arise out of that audit.                 While the allegations relate to services provided under contracts entered into in 2005, this does not present any excuse for what has happened. The service providers, and the department in managing the service providers, must do better. I am confident, however, that the combination of the new Humanitarian Services Settlement program, which commenced in April this year - with Newcastle now being identified as a separate region, not as part of the Sydney region - and the other measures I have outlined will ensure that refugees who are settled in the Newcastle area receive appropriate support.                 Australia does have a good record when it comes to settling refugees. This has been recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres. But we do need to do better in relation to the issues that have been identified in Newcastle. I thank again the member for Newcastle for bringing these issues to my attention and look forward to working with her and other members in the Newcastle region in implementing the report's recommendations.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question, because we have had a humiliating backdown from the Western Australian Premier today - he has been forced to admit that he knew that if he took this decision to increase royalties then it would be withdrawn by the independent Grants Commission. He has finally admitted that today. He has also put some correspondence in circulation which goes back almost 13 months - 13 months ago he did raise the question of fines but in the 13 months since then he has not discussed the matter with me. It is a matter he has not discussed, but he did put that in a letter - no doubt about that. But he did not say that he was moving to put it in that budget then or in a subsequent budget, because he made that announcement before the budget before last.                  So what the Western Australian Premier has conceded today is that he went ahead with a royalty increase knowing that that would most probably result in less revenue for the people of Western Australia. And what that demonstrates is that he is all about politics, not about the benefit to Western Australians, not about investing in infrastructure in Western Australia. So the Western Australian Premier has kicked an own goal. He has increased his royalties but the money is going to be withdrawn, as he knew - as he indicated in that letter - it would be withdrawn. The proof of all of this is an article by Michael Pascoe that appeared in the press on the weekend. He talks about going to Western Australia about a year ago and he says he was talking to Norman Moore, the longest serving MP in that government, and Mr Moore looked him straight in the eye and said to him there was little point lifting royalties as the Commonwealth Grants Commission process would immediately take the revenue away. So the whole time they knew that if they lifted their royalties it would be withdrawn by the independent Grants Commission. They knew that and despite that they went ahead and lifted royalties in this budget - not in the budget before this, not one year ago. So he knew, as is shown by correspondence that was sent in his own name to the Treasury.                     I certainly do; I do stand by what I have said about this matter. The fact is this: the Western Australian Premier has kicked an own goal. He has increased his royalties knowing that they would be withdrawn, knowing that was the case, having mentioned that in correspondence and having had his ministers going around telling journalists that that would be the case - and he did not proceed in the budget before last. But suddenly out of the blue he comes forward last week and increases his royalties and then goes out and pretends that that revenue would not be withdrawn despite having admitted that in correspondence and despite having his ministers travel around telling journalists it would be withdrawn - despite all of that.                  This is the Premier of Western Australia who this time last year was claiming that mining companies were being taxed too heavily. And, of course, what does he do this year? He increases the taxation of mining companies and he does it in such a way that it makes it difficult for further investment to take place in infrastructure in Western Australia. So what we have is an own goal from the Western Australian Premier and he is also carrying on about this because he knows his budget figures are bodgy, based on exchange rate assumptions which mean that his budget figures are wrong - not just this year but for the rest of the forward estimates.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and, of course, the member for Deakin comes to this place with a good knowledge about what it is like to get a trade education, having been an electrician before he came into this parliament. The budget was about jobs and opportunities and making sure that Australians can fairly share the opportunities that a strong economy brings, particularly that they can have access to the skills they need in the workforce of today to get ahead. We want Australians to be able to have the benefits of work and we want Australians to be able to have the benefits of opportunity, and that means that people need to be able to get access to the education opportunities which will transform their life chances. Yesterday I spoke about the transformation that is happening in Australian universities as more people get the benefit of a university education and more of those students come from poorer backgrounds and from rural and regional areas.                  The budget is about jobs. It is about creating half a million jobs in the next couple of years on top of the 750,000 jobs created under this government to date. And it means that our unemployment rate will fall to 4.5 per cent. We know that our economy will be running near full capacity and that means that it will be hungry for infrastructure, hungry for working people and hungry for skills - and we want to feed that hunger. More than 95,000 Australians started a trade in the last 12 months. That is more Australians starting a trade than at any time in the last decade. I think that is good news. New figures released today by the National Centre for Vocational Educational Research show that there has been a 6.3 per cent increase in the number of Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships in the year to 31 December 2010. Trade training commencements for the 12 months to December 2010 increased by more than 20 per cent. Completions are also rising - not just commencements but completions - making sure people stay the course, stay the journey and get through. They have been growing every quarter since March 2009.                 This is good news. We acted quickly to save our skills base and save opportunity in our economy when the global financial crisis hit. Now we want to build on that with a $560 million fund to train up to 130,000 workers, that being a direct partnership with industry so the training will be right for the jobs that industry has going. We will invest $200 million over four years in smarter ways of completing an apprenticeship, and we will devote $100 million of that to support apprentices to progress through training at their pace, so that when they have got the skills they can move through to the next stage.                 We will also be investing in mentors. We know that even with increasing completion rates too many young people start an apprenticeship and do not see the journey through. We know good mentoring can make a difference to that and we will be funding 300 experienced mentors to provide much needed support to apprentices. This is all part of making sure our economy stays strong, making sure Australians have got the benefits of work and making sure, too, that Australians can share opportunities by having a chance at a great education.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for a very fine question. It is a source of tremendous pride for the Australian people that our economy has come through the global recession in better shape than just about any other developed economy. We have avoided recession, unlike most other advanced economies. The thing that we are most proud of is that we have seen the creation in Australia of over 700,000 jobs since Labor came to office. That is while the rest of the developed world has shed something like 30 million jobs over the same period. We have an unemployment rate with a 'four' in front of it, and that stands in very stark contrast to what is going on in other developed economies. We will get the budget back in the black by 2012-13. What this really shows is that we on this side of the House have got all the big economic calls right. If we had listened to those on the other side of the House, our country would have gone into recession, unemployment would have been far higher and of course without the bank guarantees we would have seen many small businesses hit the fence. The outcomes of these decisions prove that we on this side of the House have got the big economic calls right. If those on that side of the House had had their way, where would we be right now? There would be no savings to bring the budget back to surplus, there would be no plan to keep the economy strong, there would be no plan to tackle climate change and there would be no plan for clean energy jobs for the future.                  Those opposite think it is a smart political tactic to be negative all the time. But when you are negative all the time you cannot focus on a clear plan for the future. If they had their way, there would be clear consequences for jobs and for price pressures in the Australian economy. They can go around and peddle their negative approach but people out there in the fish and chip shops and the butcher shops, in retail, want someone with a clear plan for the future - a clear plan and a government that will stick up for jobs and for business investment; a government that will stick by them in the tough times, particularly during floods and global recessions. What do we get during all of this from those on that side of the House? Those on that side of the House just want to side with the big polluters and with big tobacco. We on this side of the House will stand up for the national interest.

  What I have been given notice of are the words of Premier Barnett today. This is what he had to say:                 We know if we get more mining royalty income under the current arrangement, our GST falls, we do know that                 That is what the Western Australian Premier has said today.                     He has maintained the fiction for the past five days that that was not the case. For the past five days he has gone around pretending that he knew nothing about the consequences of his decision to increase royalties.                     For five days the Western Australian Premier has maintained that he had no knowledge that this would occur if he increased royalties and that he would lose the money. Today he has admitted that they knew they would get less funding by raising their royalties - game, set and match.

  I thank the member for his question and for his genuine concern about infrastructure issues in his electorate. I will be visiting his electorate with him next month to look at issues around Kalgoorlie and then Meekatharra. The member's question goes to the government funding of the Gateway project. Yes, we will fund the Gateway project. The Gateway project needs funding because it is the most important infrastructure project for Western Australia. We know that, because of the fly-in fly-out workforce and because of the massive expansion of the resources industry in the west, there is enormous pressure on the roads, the freight system and the intermodal system around the airport and also across through Fremantle port. We know that because it has been identified as an absolute priority project, which is why we make no apologies for the commitment we made during the election campaign and we make no apologies for making provision in the budget to deliver on our commitments. Last week, when I was in Western Australia selling the budget message, the member for Canning was out there supporting this government's investment in the Gateway WA project. Perhaps he could have a word with the WA Libs and the WA Nats who seem to have a difference of opinion on this.                 The fact of the matter is that every single major infrastructure project under way in Western Australia has a Commonwealth commitment to it - every single one of them. They include, in the next year, a record $920 million in infrastructure in the transport sector to Western Australia alone, including, in the honourable member's electorate, the upgrade of the road and rail infrastructure into Port Esperance where $60 million worth of work will commence in the following year, the Great Northern Highway at Port Hedland, the Bunbury Port access road, Perth Urban Transport and Freight Corridor upgrade and the Great Eastern Highway. Work will commence on all those projects in the coming year, as well as the very important project to bring Perth together, the Northbridge rail link project through Perth's CBD. We make no apologies for the record investment we are delivering to the West, some $3.7 billion over the Nation Building Program, almost double what the previous mob committed when they were in office.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. As members of the House would be aware, the Climate Commission has today held a forum in Parliament House as part of a series of forums the commission has been conducting around Australia to help deepen the understanding of the climate science. It follows the publication of the commission's report yesterday, which provides an important update on the climate science and outlines the risks we confront from climate change. There is nothing like this issue to bring out the extent of misrepresentation that the Leader of the Opposition will engage in. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the Climate Commission's report vindicated the coalition's so-called 'direct action policy', but when you look at what the report says about direct action measures, which rely almost entirely on carbon offsets through tree planting and soil management to store carbon, quite a different story emerges. The report has this to say:                 It cannot substitute in the long term for the reduction of an equivalent amount of CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. In fact, the offset approach, if poorly implemented, has the potential to lock in more severe climate change for the future.                 As if that was not clear enough, the author of the report, Professor Will Steffen, had this to say yesterday in relation to this approach:                 There's a very good case for getting carbon back into the land, but if that's all you do, or if you use that to delay action on fossil fuel emissions, you will have gone backwards a long way.                 This is another example of the way in which the Leader of the Opposition continually misrepresents the facts and the science in this debate . The point is that we can look to methods for storage of carbon but at the end of the day we must cut pollution levels in our economy to tackle this issue and we must drive investment in cleaner energy sources.                  Given that the Leader of the Opposition previously attended the rally outside Parliament House organised by a number of interesting organisations and individuals, including the League of Rights and Pauline Hanson, it is particularly disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition would not attend the forum today in Parliament House run by well-respected scientists and economists on the issue of the climate science. A couple of his colleagues were there today, including the shadow minister, the member for Flinders. At least we should acknowledge that the member for Flinders has been trying to provide the Liberal Party some respectability on the climate science, but he is up against a pretty powerful group, within his own side of politics, of deniers on this issue. Senator Minchin, Senator Abetz, Senator Joyce, Senator Boswell, the member for Indi and the member for Tangney have all, over the last 24 hours, trashed his claim that the coalition has bipartisan support over the climate science. In fact, they have walked all over him and the Leader of the Opposition does nothing to stand up for his shadow minister on this important issue. On this side of the House, we respect the climate science and accept the responsibility to act upon it. On that side of the House, they do nothing but deny the evidence and they will not take responsibility.

  This is very sloppy, Joe.                     I quote from the West Australian -                      It absolutely answers the question. On 21 October 2010, the West Australian, in an article by Shane Wright, quoted the Western Australian Premier, who said:                 The State has no intention of increasing royalties -                      I am going to work my way through it. The quote was:                 The State has no intention of increasing royalties, but we will certainly reserve the right to do so.                 That was October. You came into the House before and quoted from an executive minute. The executive minute that you quoted from only says Western Australia were considering an increase; it does not say they were doing an increase, and they did not do an increase in the budget before last. We were informed at the last minute that they had taken that decision. We were not consulted about this decision and we were not given any time to consider it. We were not given any time to respond. We were informed after the budget papers went to bed. That is the situation. Why are those on the other side of the House so antsy about all of this? I can tell you why: it is because they are so embarrassed about their position on mining taxation. When a Labor government takes the decision they think that the mining companies pay too much tax, but when a Liberal government takes a decision to increase a royalty that is terrific. That just shows the rank hypocrisy of those opposite.                     What I said was that we did not give it the tick. You just quoted the full quote yourself in your question - another own goal from those opposite! That is two in a row: Colin Barnett and Joe Hockey. They have both had very bad weeks. In the case of the Western Australian Premier, you can see how. He has brought down a budget based on dodgy figures. He has framed his budget around an exchange rate of 98c next year, when the Reserve Bank and the government are using $1.07.                     Do you know what that means? His revenue estimates are out over the forward estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars, and that is what this is all about.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. We on this side of the House know that big tobacco spends millions and millions of dollars crafting their packaging to make it attractive and appealing, particularly to new smokers. In a world first, we are committed to removing the last legal avenue to advertise tobacco products in Australia. From next year, tobacco will be sold in plain packaging with stronger health-warning information. We know big tobacco is going to fight this every step of the way. They have said that their sales will drop, that their profits will drop and that other countries are going to be watching what we are going to do. Tobacco companies have told us that this is going to lead to Australia being overrun by crime gangs, that more kids will take up smoking and that they will be forced to slash their prices.                 When you are up against this sort of hogwash from big tobacco, you need to have some guts and you need to not wimp out under pressure. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has not shown whether he has got that strength of character. Last week he seemed to be cowed by big tobacco executives. In an almost exactly uniform chorus with the CEO of British American Tobacco, the Leader of the Opposition repeated the same scaremongering. The Leader of the Opposition, I am afraid I have to report to the House, is acting like the parliamentary arm of big tobacco. He is sticking up for big tobacco in the same way he is sticking up for big polluters. It seems to me that he is finding it very hard to say no to such a big donor to the Liberal Party. But there are some members of the coalition who have the strength of character to stand up for the health of Australians. The member for Moore, Dr Washer, was quoted on this subject in the Age newspaper on the weekend. I quote from the article for any members on this side of the House who perhaps did not see the quote. Dr Washer said:                 The tobacco industry is jumping up and down because they're worried about their businesses. I support these reforms unequivocally and whatever my party decides to do, I don't give a -                  I think, Mr Speaker, that the next word might not be parliamentary, although it was reported in the Age - it rhymes with 'hit'. The Leader of the Opposition now needs to show the same backbone that some on his backbench are showing. Our government is prepared to lead the world. It is about time Mr Abbott started leading the coalition.

  I do stand by my words, and I also draw the member's attention to what the Premier himself said publicly -                      I have answered the question. You asked me whether I stood by my words. I have said that I do, and I draw your attention to the words of the Western Australian Premier on 21 October: 'The state has no intention of increasing royalties, but we will certainly preserve the right to do so.' And that was after, you idiot.                     I withdraw.

  I thank my good friend the member for Banks for his question. Recent research shows that smoking kills over 15,000 Australians every year and costs Australia around $31.5 billion per year. Both active and passive smoking increase the risk of lung cancer as well as 12 other cancers and a range of other health conditions. Reducing this impact is a priority for our government. This issue should not be dragged into a political scuffle designed to mask the level of financial contributions made by tobacco companies to the Liberal Party - or at least to the federal Liberal Party, if not all branches.                 Most Australian smokers regret having started smoking at all and have made at least one attempt to quit. We need to support people to successfully quit and we know that plain packaging is a key step. I can point to 12 key different research studies only in the last two years covering the issues of branding, design and the promotion of tobacco packaging. Each and every one of them supports strategies such as the introduction of plain packaging to assist in reducing smoking rates. Just a few titles: 'Adolescents' perceptions of cigarette brand image: does plain packaging make a difference?' in the Journal of Adolescent Health; 'The impact of cigarette package design on perceptions of risk', from the Journal of Public Health; and 'Plain packaging: findings from female youth in the UK', a paper presented at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco. I table the list.                 Other research shows that plain packaging will increase the impact of health warning messages, will reduce the ability of packaging to mislead consumers to believe that some products may be less harmful than others and will reduce the attractiveness of the tobacco product for adults but particularly for children. A 2008 evaluation of Australia's graphic health warnings on tobacco products showed that more than six in 10 recent quitters said that the graphic health warnings had helped them to quit, but respondents also said that tobacco industry branding and the use of colour on packaging overpowered the graphic health warnings, particularly on the front of the package. The campaign run by tobacco companies throughout the debate on the introduction of plain packaging proves that they are concerned about the impact of this measure in reducing smoking rates in our community due to the inevitable impact it is going to have on their sales figures. There is no other explanation.                 We cannot and we must not sacrifice the health of our community in favour of profits for tobacco companies. This government is committed to the health and the wellbeing of Australians. The evidence is very clear that this measure will reduce smoking in Australia and it is about time that the opposition - the whole of the opposition - stopped mucking around and got behind this world-leading measure.

  Very simply, because I did not. It is pretty simple, because when the Western Australian government took this decision they did not consult with us at all, and they took it knowing that when they increased the rate for fines the Grants Commission would take the action of reducing the increase in revenue. They are now acutely embarrassed because the correspondence shows very clearly that they understood that. What that means is that they have been caught out being too smart by half - playing politics and not looking after the interests of the taxpayers of Western Australia. They are not looking after Western Australia but playing politics. We have done the right thing by the people of Western Australia, and the Western Australian Premier has done the wrong thing. He has done the wrong thing because he has produced a bodgie budget based on unrealistic exchange rate evaluations, and what that means is that they are in deep trouble.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of people with mental illness. In this budget the government is delivering a major funding boost to community mental health services. In fact, $260 million extra will go to community mental health services over the next five years. This, of course, is part of our $2.2 billion investment in mental health reform that will provide much-needed support to thousands of Australians who have been waiting so long for that increase. In fact, in the community mental health area, we expect around 35,000 extra Australians and their carers will get support as a result of these improvements. I think all of us are aware that people with severe mental illness have very low workforce participation and many of them are also extremely socially isolated. This budget tackles both of these issues head on.                 Just last Monday I was pleased to go up to Bendigo with the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing and the member for Bendigo. We went to the Personal Helpers and Mentors service in Bendigo, which is run by St Luke's. It is a great service. It is one of 175 Personal Helpers and Mentors services around Australia, and it is delivering services to people with very severe mental illness in our community. One of the people that I spoke with there indicated to me how much he appreciated the support he gets, but he said he wanted to make sure that other people like him are getting that support.                 As a result of the government's investment in community mental health in this budget, we will be able to provide 425 additional personal helpers and mentors who will be able to work intensively with people who have severe mental illness living in the community. This will mean helping people to find employment. It might mean helping them reconnect with their families or doing some of the day-to-day tasks that most of us take for granted that people with severe mental illness often find very difficult - making sure their rent gets paid, making sure they get their shopping done or planning and getting to interviews and appointments with medical professionals. These tasks often present very serious barriers to people with mental illness, and we note that personal helpers and mentors provide excellent support to help people address these difficulties.                   We also know that it is often the case that people with severe mental illness are very isolated and alone. Once again at St Luke's one of the people we spoke to said to me that he would often go for weeks at a time without speaking to another human being. That was of course before he was attending St Luke's on a regular basis and before he got a personal helper and mentor himself. It is as a result of their care that he is now getting the support he needs. It is the case that far too many people with severe mental illness do not look for the support they need from the medical profession. As a result of these personal helpers and mentors, they are able to get the support they need. This government is delivering the long-term investment in mental health and the long-term strategy that people deserve.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question because I know that on this side of the House we value the investment in education that this government is providing, recognising that it provides a substantial suite of opportunities for Australian students to reach fulfilment and to build prosperity for the nation as a whole. In this year's budget we saw investments of some $800 million in initiatives. The Gillard government is now investing more than $64 billion - nearly double the amount spent by the coalition in their last term in office - because we want to see every single Australian have access to a great education and every Australian school to be a great one.                 We have reforms that are benefiting every student, whether they are in government schools, Catholic schools or non-government schools. We have developed and delivered the My School website, providing transparent access to information on every school for the first time. We now have an Australian curriculum in four subjects - English, maths, science and history - from reception or kindy through to year 12. We have made available $2.5 billion in partnerships with states and territories, improving literacy and numeracy, really looking at the results of our low-performing students. That is about 1,900 government schools, 400 Catholic schools and 200 independent schools all receiving the benefit of this government's investment in education.                 We also know that kids with disabilities need support. We were very pleased in this budget to bring through an additional $200 million to support kids with disabilities in schools. It will make a significant difference in those schools where teachers have kids with disabilities. For example, a deaf student might access equipment which provides text captions of the teacher's words very quickly after the teacher has spoken. This would mean that the student could access the teacher's instructions, including complex terms, alongside other students in the classroom with them. Other potential supports are occupational therapy, special equipment in classrooms, extra teaching hours and the like. Importantly, this initiative also provides support for teachers so that they can improve the planning and delivery of programs, lessons and activities that enhance the way students with disabilities learn and are included in the classroom. Every time the opposition are asked a question about education, every time we hear something from them on education, what we have on the record is $2.8 billion of announced cuts in education. The fact is that over 11 years the coalition put in about 3,000 flagpoles. In our time in government we have provided funding for nearly 3,000 libraries. There is no statistic that better sums up the difference between the approach on this side of the House and the approach of those on that side of the House. Labor knows that education creates skills and productivity; it enables prosperity. We are building Australia's future by making every school a great school, and the budget showed how we are delivering that in spades.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Earlier in question time the shadow Treasurer read the Deputy Prime Minister's full quote to the parliament and every word of that full quote is true and accurate. Having watched the proceedings today of the opposition frontbench, I have rarely seen such a poorly thought through attack in question time in all of the time I have been in this parliament. What the opposition are failing to recognise and at some point -                      They have asked me for my view and I am entitled to give my view having been asked. At some point they need to stop, draw a breath and do a tiny little bit of thinking instead of their negative howling. If they do that they will recognise the following: what the Treasurer said publicly is that we did not give the tick to these royalty increases. We were not consulted about them and that is clear. Getting advice that the royalty increases are in the budget documents when the budget documents are already locked in is not consultation.                 And then go back to a letter 13 months ago, to a meeting in April last year, and after that time - after the time of that letter and that meeting - the Premier of Western Australia himself was out verifying publicly that he had no present plans to increase royalties.                     I have the quote here, as they chant. This is yet another distortion from the opposition. On 21 October 2010, the Premier of Western Australia said:                 The state has no intention of increasing royalties but we will certainly reserve the right to do so.                     The meeting that the Manager of Opposition Business is yelling about was before that. So get the time line right. Stop and think at how absurd this attack is.                 Then I should say to the opposition that I think all of this is a distraction from two things. First and foremost, they are trying to distract from the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went up and down the nation before the last election sitting in mining communities and in mining boardrooms and saying to the people in those communities and saying to the people in those boardrooms: 'We believe any additional taxation on mining will kill the industry. We believe it will cost jobs.' And now they have been caught out, because if they genuinely believed that then their only option would be to condemn the actions of Premier Barnett. But they do not want to do that because they view their party ticket as more important to them than being straight and honest with the Australian people.                 One of the reasons we are seeing this carry-on today is their absolute shame at their conduct before the last election and that they have been caught out now. The other reason we are seeing it - and we always see this kind of bravado when they are at their most deeply divided - is that the member for Wentworth and the Leader of the Opposition have had heated telephone calls back and forth; the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition have had heated telephone calls -

  I thank the member for Calwell for her question and remind the House that on 5 May this year I was fortunate enough to accompany 21 former POWs to Kirribilli House, where the Prime Minister announced a new payment for them: the prisoner of war recognition payment. This payment, reflected in the budget papers, will provide $500 a fortnight tax-free, indexed and without any income test to veterans who are former POWs of the Second World War and the Korean War. Mr Speaker, you will recall that over 30,000 Australians were prisoners of war during the Second World War and the Korean War. This announcement is important. It provides $27 million over four years. It will come into effect as of 20 September this year.                 Interestingly, of the people who were at Kirribilli House, at least one of them accompanied the Governor-General to Hellfire Pass in Thailand for Anzac Day. Lex Arthurson, from the 13th Australian General Hospital; the Hon. Tom Uren, a former member of this place and minister in the government, from Sparrow Force; Bill Schmitt from the 2nd/3rd Machine Gun Battalion; and Cyril Gilbert from the 8th Division, 27th Brigade accompanied the Governor-General to Hellfire Pass on Anzac Day. Over this last weekend, I accompanied six veterans to Crete to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete. Three of these veterans were former POWs: Arthur Leggett from the 2nd/11th Battalion, Bill Taylor from the 2nd/11th Battalion and Norm Maddock from the 2nd/7th Battalion.                 We need to just reflect for a moment on the experiences of these brave men during the Second World War and the Korean War. We need to understand the trauma that they experienced. We need to continue to appreciate the courage and resilience they showed and the hardships that they endured. We need to acknowledge that through this payment. I commend the Prime Minister for her leadership and the government for making this payment available during the budget. It is worth reflecting for a moment on how Tom Uren described the payment. He said:                  It's justice and compassion, that's what this recognises. It recognises the suffering of our people.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question, because we are absolutely aware of cost of living pressures on Australian families. That is the first reason why we are so emphatic about creating jobs, about putting in place an economic policy which will see more jobs and more secure jobs. And that is why we opposed the policy of those opposite when it came to Work Choices, because they wanted to make people more insecure in their employment. We are absolutely aware that we need to provide support to families, particularly those on low and middle incomes. That is why over three years we put in place tax cuts which were a very substantial benefit to people on modest incomes. That is why we have substantially increased the childcare cash rebate, to 50 per cent. That is why we have included school uniforms in the education tax rebate. That is why we have put in place a very substantial increase for those families who have got teenagers who are studying, up to something like $4,000 a year.                 But overall the thing that we must do to support families is to make sure that our economy is prosperous and that jobs growth is strong. If those opposite had had their way, had they been in charge in recent years, Australia would have been in a recession, unemployment would have been far higher and Australian families would have been far less secure. We understand that we also need to price carbon in this country to make sure that we continue to have strong growth. In pricing carbon, we will ensure that every cent raised from that carbon price goes either to households or to industry. That is why we will put forward a responsible policy which will guarantee our prosperity and do the right thing by future generations. We will not do what those on that side of the House are doing -                      They are sticking their heads in the sand. At least the member for Wentworth understands the importance of putting in place sound policy for the future. That is what we are doing and that is what we will continue to do.

  I thank the member for Moreton for that question. We will be out there tonight barracking for the Queenslanders. I know the Leader of the House is a bit upset by this! But on this side of the House, as I was saying before, we understand the importance of strong economic growth to secure communities and to jobs. We understand the importance of the creation of 700,000 jobs and the creation of a further 500,000 jobs in the next two and a bit years. We also understand that investment in our economy is going to 50-year highs. We understand that there is an investment pipeline of something like $380 billion. This is going to support strong growth, particularly strong jobs growth, and rising incomes, and it will boost our export capacity. This is all very good for the security of families in our community.                 These are great opportunities ahead for Australia, but we also know there are some pretty hefty challenges as well. We know when this investment kicks in it will cause price pressures in our economy. We also know that it will stretch the capacity of our workforce and place greater demands on infrastructure, which is why we put in place the budget that we did a couple of weeks ago, coming back to surplus in 2012-13 to make sure we do not add to those price pressures, getting a bigger trained workforce, investing in apprenticeships, breaking the cycle of welfare dependence. These are all the objectives we must share so we have a strong economy and security.                 Of course, our fiscal policy stands in very stark contrast to the fiscal policy that applied during mining boom mark 1. What we have got in place is very strict fiscal discipline. We have got the lowest rate of expenditure increase - we have got a one per cent increase in expenditure over five years. That stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who let it rip during mining boom mark 1, with expenditure increasing by 3.7 per cent every year for five years. This point has been made very clearly by UBS's Scott Haslem just in the past week. He goes out to compare the fiscal policy during mining boom mark 1 with the fiscal policy during mining boom mark 2, and he says that the contrast could not be starker. He has got this to say:                 _ in the three years to 2005/06  -  through the first phase of the current commodity boom  -  real government expenditure averaged four per cent per year _                     They do not like it, Mr Speaker. They went on a spending spree at the height of mining boom mark 1, and 10 interest rate rises followed. They do not like that at all. But Mr Haslem has blown the whistle on their approach to economic policy and demonstrated how unsuited they are to our current circumstances because, if they were in government, there would be no savings, there would be no return to surplus, there would be no investment in the workforce. And of course if they were there, there would be a great black hole, an $11 billion black hole, in their financial plans. What all this proves is that they are no more qualified to run an economy during mining boom mark 2 than they were during mining boom mark 1.

  I thank the member for Page for her question, which is about the future of the Australian nation and about her constituents and their access to jobs and opportunity today - that is, it is a very serious question. The government is focused on keeping the economy strong. First and foremost, what we need to deliver for Australians is a strong economy. Our economy is strong today, and that is because we have made the right judgments in the past to keep the economy strong. When the global financial crisis threatened, we invested to save 200,000 Australian jobs, to keep people working. We have made the right decisions to rebuild Queensland and other disaster affected parts of the nation and to fund that properly. We made the right decision to kill Work Choices, the biggest threat to families struggling with cost-of-living pressures. And we have made the right decisions, tough decisions, to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised, because it is the right decision for our economy - not for government to add to inflationary pressures which would feed through to cost-of-living pressures in a growing economy.                 We understand that as our economy strengthens there will be some parts of the nation that are leaping ahead and some that will fear that they are at risk of being left behind. When I speak of the 'patchwork economy', it is of these economic circumstances that I speak. That is why the government are so determined to make sure that we spread the opportunities that this phase of economic growth gives us - the opportunities to get a job, with half a million jobs to be created over the next couple of years, building on the 750,000 jobs created so far; and the opportunity to get a trade, to get skills, to get the skills you need to get your first job and then, when you have that first job, to get another, better job. That is why even in a tight budget we have made sure that $3 billion are available to invest in skills.                 We understand that, as our economy grows, so it is an economy in transition. We are an economy in transition from the phase of the global financial crisis to a phase of rapid growth. We are also an economy that needs to be in transition from generating more emissions per head of carbon pollution than any other developed nation on earth to a clean energy economy. That is why, as our economy faces that transition, we will act in the most efficient and prudent way to spur that transition to a clean economy, and that is by pricing carbon. And in this phase of economic growth we will also be spreading the opportunities that come from the minerals boom through the Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the opportunity that it represents for Australian companies to have a reduced tax rate, for Australian small businesses to enjoy new tax arrangements and tax breaks and for working people to enjoy more superannuation and a better retirement income.                 Our economic strategy is central to everything that this government does, because there is no more important priority for the future of Australians and their families than keeping the economy strong. It is about the jobs and opportunities they have today and it is about building and spreading those opportunities for tomorrow.

  I thank the member for his question. The commentary in that particular letter related to Pilbara fines; it did not relate to fines in general.                     It is just a fact. Of course, those opposite want to ignore all of the facts here, because they are acutely embarrassed by the fact that the premier of Western Australia has misled Western Australians and the Australian people on eight separate occasions. The letter he is talking about is one that refers to a change in the royalty rates for fines in the Pilbara, which is a completely separate matter from what the premier did in his most recent budget. That is something they have deliberately confused all the way through this debate. He asked why it was blacked out. It is not a decision that I took; it is a decision taken by the decision maker in the department.                 But what is this all about? This is all about the fact that those opposite do not have an alternative economic policy and they are acutely embarrassed about their incapacity to put one forward.                     This cannot be on relevance!                     Of course it is.                     You have got to be joking.                     I am not joking.                     I withdraw, Mr Speaker.                     Mr Speaker, the Treasurer was asked a question that did not contain any argument or any debate. He is now straying well from a directly relevant answer.                     There has been a misleading campaign from those opposite to mix up a whole lot of separate issues. In the case of this minute, the minute was referring to changes that would take place in the Pilbara regarding fines, which is entirely separate from the case they have been prosecuting in this House both yesterday and today. It is entirely separate from the recent decision taken by the premier of Western Australia in his most recent budget, which, on eight occasions, he told the Australian people and the Western Australian people that he would not do, and in correspondence with the Grants Commission he said he would not do it because it was a sovereign risk. So he is saying one thing to the Australian people and apparently doing another, which is exactly what those in this House are doing as well, and continue to do.                 The reason they are engaged in this political behaviour and this negative, mud-slinging campaign against me and the government is that they are acutely embarrassed. They do not have an alternative economic policy. They could not put one up in this House a couple of weeks ago. The shadow Treasurer had a shocker at the Press Club and they are acutely embarrassed by their incompetence.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question, and once again it is a serious question about opportunities for Australians in his electorate. I know that this has been a very long passion of his. I know that in the last parliament, when I was minister for education, he and some very determined and very effective advocates from his community who had worked with him for a long period of time came to see me about their concerns about low post-school participation in their local community. In truth, when we looked at the statistics the member for Lyne and his community had a lot to be concerned about, because by the standards of the nation and by the standards of some other parts of the nation their community was at risk of falling behind. And they were determined to change that. As part of that determination we worked with them to provide $165,000 to the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council to undertake a tertiary education feasibility study. It is very good work for a local community to do.                 I spoke a while ago about the importance of keeping our economy strong, and of course that is central to everything that the government does. But I understand that, whilst we work to keep our economy strong, that in and of itself does not spread opportunity around the nation. We need to do more. And the work that the member has been doing with his local community is about doing more and is about making post-school opportunities available in his own community. Consequently, I am pleased that, through that work, an application will come forward to the regional round of the Education Investment Fund to create a multipartner university campus on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I know that the application will seek $20 million in seed funding. Of course, this will be looked at by our experts who oversee the Education Investment Fund, but this is very important work to build on what has been done in the past.                 The member asked me to contrast this approach with the work of the Grattan Institute. I am a very big respecter of the Grattan Institute and, of course, I will study their work, but my sense is that in order to keep building opportunity in regional Australia we need to go down the kind of pathways that the member and his community are looking to go down. And I think we should reassure ourselves that change is possible. A lot of people said to me in my early days as Minister for Education that you cannot change the fact that when it comes to university education poorer kids and kids from rural and regional areas tend to miss out. They said it is a given, it is a disadvantage that is compounded earlier in life, and you cannot make a difference to it at the university level.                 We have proved that wrong already by the changes we have made in university education: more places, loadings to universities to actually go out and work with low-SES communities, more reward in terms of a regional loading and a fairer system of youth allowance. The result of that is that, whilst the participation rate of rural and regional kids in university was going down under the Howard government, now it is coming back up. That is good news for anybody who genuinely cares about the prospects and life chances of people in rural and regional Australia. I certainly believe we need to do more. This is a pathway to do more. I think it will stand as a very innovative model for communities around the nation and I am looking forward to continuing working with the member on it.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question, as he knows that this government's first priority is to keep the economy strong so we can keep families in jobs. This budget builds on our very strong record of supporting and creating jobs. There are now 750,000 more Australians in work than there were when we came into office in November 2007.                 We believe that more Australians should be able to share in the benefits of our strong economy - enjoy the financial and the social benefits that come from work. Too many Australians have missed out on a job for far too long. This budget delivers a very significant workforce participation package which rewards work and provides new opportunities but which also introduces new requirements and new obligations on those who are looking for work. It also takes a very innovative approach to addressing disadvantage in targeted locations around our country. There are specific measures and support for different groups, such as wage subsidies for the long-term unemployed and new participation obligations for teenage parents, jobless families and younger people on the disability pension. There are more support services, such as the new Communities for Children initiative. All of these initiatives are designed to couple intensive support with increased obligations, to give that extra help that people need to get them into work and to make sure that they too are able to share in economic opportunities.                 This government is pioneering a new welfare equation. On the one side, there is an expectation that people should take personal responsibility for themselves and for their children - to make sure that their children get to school, to make sure that they provide a secure and caring home and to make sure that they plan for the future. On the other side, there is an expectation that government must be there to deliver the conditions in the welfare system - the practical support and the opportunities that foster personal responsibility. This new welfare equation has been acknowledged by organisations like the Brotherhood of St Laurence:                   At long last we see policy initiatives that recognise that the most disadvantaged in our community have modest mainstream aspirations and that they won't shy from increased                    obligations in welfare if they are matched with more and better assistance.                   This is the test of the new welfare morality: that increased obligations are commensurate with the additional assistance on offer. It's a test that the welfare initiatives in the Budget pass.

  I thank the member for that question, because there has been a degree of discussion about road funding in New South Wales, and a lot of it has been inaccurate. I pay tribute to the fantastic job the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, our roads minister, is doing. He sat down, along with the Prime Minister, to work our way through infrastructure issues in New South Wales. He reached agreement with some ministers in New South Wales. It is just a pity their Premier ratted on the deal.                     That is actually what happened. We remain committed to investing in roads in New South Wales, in suburban Sydney, along the Pacific Highway and out into our great regions. We are very proud of our record of investing in infrastructure in road, rail and ports. Our minister is doing a fantastic job there, and there is absolutely no need for any changes to our budget.

  I thank the member for Throsby. I visited Shell Harbour with the member for Throsby last week. On Tuesday, I visited Wyong with the member for Dobell and the member for Shortland. On Friday, I visited Elizabeth with the member for Wakefield. I looked at three of the 10 sites for new employment and participation programs that were announced in the recent budget. In each location, local members and I met with community organisation that will work with the government to help jobseekers back into the workforce.                 This budget has focused squarely on jobs. It has focused on education and training to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom make it into every corner of Australia, including some of our most disadvantaged communities. In our new location based approach, welfare recipients will have greater responsibilities to participate but they will also have extra help. Centrelink will have dedicated case workers for the most disadvantaged jobseekers and will work closely and in many cases under the same roof -                      Peter Griffin just cannot keep it down. We have Stewie up here; we have Peter Griffin down there. Just keep a lid on it, Peter Griffin.                     Centrelink is going to have dedicated case workers for the most disadvantaged jobseekers and will work closely and in many cases under the same roof with financial counselling services, drug and alcohol counselling services, housing and homelessness services and other types of services to help long-term unemployed back into the workforce by overcoming the issues that have kept them unemployed.                 Case coordination will allow Centrelink case workers to work more closely with jobseekers. For example, instead of a jobseeker turning up and talking to any person who happens to be on the counter, they will have a dedicated case worker. After all that time that they may have been too embarrassed to tell Centrelink that they cannot read and write well enough to fill in an application form a job, they will now have one person who they can talk to who can help them access one of the 30,000 literacy and numeracy places that we have funded in this budget. A homeless jobseeker might get the help that they need to stabilise their housing so that they have a place to have a shower and a good sleep and a place where employers can phone them so that they can get back into the workforce.                 Non-government organisations will be working with us to identify the most important local changes that they can make. We have a local solutions fund of $25 million to support those local changes. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs talked about changes for teenage parents and jobless families. We want those teenage parents to reach year 12 or get an equivalent qualification. We want their kids to be school ready. We want welfare recipients to be able to keep more of what they earn, because we know that part-time work is often a stepping stone back into full-time employment and we want to make that part-time work count.                 These are just a few of the measures that the government introduced in the most recent budget to target the most disadvantaged jobseekers. In mining boom mark II we cannot allow whole regions to be left behind as they were during mining boom mark I. We have heard very little from the Leader of the Opposition on these new measures since the budget two weeks ago. He continues to be all opposition and no leader.

  I thank the member for his question. Here we go with the ongoing scare campaign from those opposite. They have not got the guts to face up to the tough decisions that we need to make to protect our economy and our environment for the future, so they just make things up day after day. We had the manufacturing spokesman out the other day claiming that there were going to be millions of jobs lost in Australia. I know what would have happened if they had been in charge during the global recession: there would have been hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in this country. They are a huge risk to our economy.                     The government is consulting with the community, business and crossbenchers about putting a price on carbon. We are working our way through that in a responsible and methodical way. We understand why it is so important to deal with dangerous climate change in this country. Sadly, that side of the House is full of climate change deniers who do not understand the science.                     They want to oppose any action on climate change. As the member for Wentworth said the other day, the Leader of the Opposition simply does not believe in the science of climate change.                     We on this side of the House do believe in action on climate change, so we are going through that consultation.                     And of course we don't have a final design, so it is impossible for anyone to be making the assertion such as the member for Aston has just made. But the member for Aston has had a little bit to say about this. In fact, recently, the member for Aston had this to say: that he didn't believe in the Liberal Party's so-called direct action policy.                     He doesn't know whether he is Arthur or Martha - in fact, many of them on that side of the House don't know either!                 But for our part, on this side of the House, we will keep doing the responsible thing by Australia, the right thing for the long-term economic and social benefit of our nation. The Leader of the Opposition is absolutely incapable -                      of facing up to the big decisions that we need to put in place to secure our prosperity and to secure our environment. He simply will not take the hard decisions. He wants to take the politically opportunistic path on every occasion -                      I know they are acutely embarrassed by the stance of the Leader of the Opposition - absolutely acutely embarrassed by the fact that he is a climate change denier. And of course the member for Wentworth belled the cat on that. On this side of the House we will get on with dealing with climate change.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know he is very concerned about the health of the constituents in his electorate. Our party has a very firm stance on tobacco and a very firm stance on tobacco donations. Tobacco kills you, and we will do all we can to reduce its harm. Our party, the Labor Party, does not take donations from these companies that sell death. Seven years ago the Labor Party ceased taking donations from tobacco companies.                 Next year plain-packaging reforms will begin, and our tobacco control measures will then be comprehensive - including anti-smoking ads, banning internet ads, an excise increase and nicotine patches on the PBS.                     Members opposite who are interjecting might be interested to know that yesterday the Cancer Council released the most comprehensive study of the evidence ever published in Australia - 24 targeted studies over the last two decades. And what they clearly show is that current packages dilute from the health warnings. It shows that packages has an impact on young people and their perception of cigarettes and those who smoke them.                 It is for these reasons that it is not surprising that we have the support of doctors, of nurses, of the Cancer Council, of the Heart Foundation, of QUIT and many more.                     In fact, those who are interjecting might be interested to know that we have the support of a few Liberal Party members as well. Maybe somebody known to those opposite, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, supports our reform. The New South Wales Liberal health minister, Jillian Skinner, supports our reform. The Liberal health minister in Victoria, David Davis, supports our reforms. Brendan Nelson, a former Liberal minister - not a health minister, but a doctor - and a former leader, supports our reforms. The member for Moore, a doctor and current member of the Liberal Party, and the member for O'Connor, support our reforms. But we have the Leader of the Opposition, a former health minister, who states:                 _ one cigarette, I am told, does you damage. But it does you so little damage.                 Can you believe a health minister would say these sorts of things?                 There are only four groups in the community that currently oppose our messages: British American Tobacco, Phillip Morris, the Liberal Party and the National Party - two tobacco companies, two political parties. And there is a reason that they are linked. I do not think I could put it any better than cartoonist David Rowe did in the Financial Reviewtoday, in his cartoon, 'Welcome to Abbott country. Enjoy the smooth taste of tobacco donations'! It is about time the Liberal Party stopped receiving donations from tobacco companies. It has been reported that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried about this that he has silenced his MPs from talking about it. That might be why the member for O'Connor, who has come out supporting our measures, explained that he is against the coalition's approach. He supports our measures, explaining: 'As you know, I'm a little bit different from the rest of the Nationals'. Well, he is certainly right about that.                 It is time for Mr Abbott to quit his habit, to stop putting the money and donations before good public policy and to start supporting this measure. Kick the habit, Mr Abbott!

  It is a bit rich for members of the coalition to come into this House and pretend to be friends of business, given their recent behaviour. They were not friends of business during the global financial crisis and the global recession. They would have seen tens of thousands of businesses go to the wall, and that is a fact. They are not friends of business -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. The concerns of business and the pace of business in Australian society is of immense importance. Of course, business is a very significant employer in our economy. The government wants to support business and we have supported business very strongly, not just during the global recession, but also by putting in place measures which will assist business. We understand that, in our two-speed or patchwork economy, not everyone in business is doing well.                 We set out over a year ago to make sure that we put in place a series of initiatives which would assist business. The first one was a big tax cut or a significant tax for small business via the $5,000 instant asset write-off and our proposals to bring down the corporate rate of tax over time. They are opposing the revenue source that will provide that advantage for Australian business. They ought to be acutely embarrassed because they have a view that the mining industry already pays too much tax and that small business and the rest of business should not get a tax cut. I think they are acutely embarrassed by that.                 As we go forward in designing an emissions trading scheme we are acutely aware that we have to get the settings right and acutely aware that what we must do for our country is to support growth in our economy. That is what we are doing as we consult with business, as we consult with the community and as we work through the multiparty committee. We are doing all of those things. Of course, those opposite just want to promote a scare campaign. We will conclude the details of an emissions trading scheme as soon as we can, and we will go out there and vigorously have a debate about who is going to support our economy, set us up for the future, create the jobs of the future, get the investment in renewable energy and make sure we protect this planet, this country, for our children and our grandchildren.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I spoke yesterday about 12 different research studies covering the issues of branding, design and the promotion of tobacco packaging. Today I want to bring the attention of the House to a review of the evidence released yesterday by the Cancer Council. The review pulls together the findings from 24 targeted studies over two decades and demonstrates very clearly that the look and the feel of tobacco packaging is a very powerful marketing tool, particularly for the recruitment of new smokers.                 Recruiting young Australians to smoking is important to big tobacco. If you want to make a profit in the tobacco business, you need new customers and you need them regularly. The shadow minister said on Sky yesterday:                 I just don't have the evidence one way or the other. ... I've asked the Government to produce the evidence. We've said we've got an open mind.                 When the Prime Minister invited me to joint her ministry, she did not inform me that one of my duties to the Australian people was to act as the research assistant to the member for Dickson, but I am very, very happy to do so on this occasion. Professor Ian Olver from the Cancer Council said yesterday:                 I think anyone who reads the review and understands how public health science works will see that the evidence is compelling and very difficult to refute.                 Lyn Roberts from the Heart Foundation said:                 This is very convincing science, based on the most rigorous study models available.                 The evidence is there. The opposition has no more excuse for delay. Any more prevarication on this measure will just confirm suspicions that they are simply doing the bidding of big tobacco. Whether that is a reality or not is not the point; it is fast becoming a perception that is setting in. I was part of the meeting of the national executive of the Labor Party several years ago which decided to refuse tobacco donations. As a long-time member of that august body, I can honestly say that it does not often offer the best moments that the Labor Party has to offer the nation, but that was an exception. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition if he were interested in this debate and was here: take our advice and take the advice of many of your own branches and get this monkey off your back. It may be a rich monkey but it is a monkey nonetheless. Read the research and get behind this world leading reform measure.                 For the assistance of the House, I table these documents: Plain packaging of tobacco products: a review of the evidenceprepared by Quit Victoria, Cancer Council of Victoria, May 2011; Is your package an effective communicator? A normative framework for increasing the communicative competence of packagingfrom the Journal of Marketing Communications; Making the pack the hero, tobacco industry response to marketing restrictions in the UK: findings from a long-term audit; Plain packaging: a time for action from the European Journal of Public Health; Plain packaging regulations for tobacco products: the impact of standardizing the color and design of cigarette packs from Salud PÃºblica de MÃ©xico; Deadly in pink: the impact of cigarette packaging among young women; Beyond light and mild: cigarette brand descriptors and perceptions of risk in the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey; and the remainder of those 23 journals. I am sure the shadow minister will spend a long night reading them tonight.

  I have already addressed all of the issues associated with that question. When we have designed the emissions trading scheme we will announce all the details and then we will have a debate about its impact for business and households, its benefit to the country in the long term and the short term, and the fact that we are going to set this country up so we can prosper into the future with lower carbon growth absolutely critical to the future of this country although not understood by any of those opposite apparently.                     I have said the government is working its way through all these issues to design the scheme. We do that in good faith. We do it in the national interest. What this is all about from those opposite today is to cover over the very deep divisions that we have seen on their side of politics - deep divisions over tobacco, deep divisions over tax, deep divisions over climate change - which have been all too apparent out there in the papers day after day. That is what we have - a smokescreen to cover up for the fact there is no alternative economic policy and no vision for the future of the country whatsoever.

  I thank the member for Petrie for a question which invites this parliament to consider the facts. I know there are some who will struggle with this concept, considering the facts, but that is what the Climate Commission Forum yesterday in Parliament House was all about. It was an opportunity for all members of parliament to listen to the facts and to hear about global warming and the science. I want to acknowledge each and every member who did attend the forum. I want to acknowledge the role of the member for New England in ensuring the forum happened here in Parliament House.                 These forums are important because they are about evidence and facts. In yesterday's forum the scientists told us that global temperatures are rising and in Australia the number of hot days has doubled over the last 50 years. The scientists told us that another 20 centimetres of rise by 2050 would more than double the risk of coastal flooding. The scientists told us of the damage already being done to the Great Barrier Reef through nine major coral-bleaching events since 1979. The scientists told us about the greater risks of extreme weather events like floods, bushfires and cyclones.                 Despite this evidence from the scientists, the reaction generally of the opposition has been to attack the scientists. We have seen Nick Minchin in particular go out and attack the scientists, claiming it is offensive to say that the debate about climate change is over and that it all needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Then there is the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly could not be bothered to look at this important report, who falsely claimed that it backed his direct action plan, whereas in fact the report actually says that such a measure would not enable us to meet our emissions reduction targets. It is a very worrying sign from the opposition that they continue to be mired in climate change denial. We know that from their general failure to attend the forum yesterday. We also know it from the member for Wentworth on Lateline who very clearly said that the Leader of the Opposition's plan is the sort of plan you have when you want one that does not work, the sort of plan you have when you want one that you can stop because in truth you are a climate change sceptic and denier and all of this is a pretence to the Australian people. I detect a theme here across the issues that have been under debate in this parliament this week. There we have the opposition on the side of the big polluters rather than tackling climate change. There we have the opposition on the side of big tobacco rather than with those who would try to save Australian lives by encouraging people not to smoke.                  What this shows is that the Leader of the Opposition in every area rejects the evidence; he rejects the expert advice. It goes to show what a risk he is and how mired he is in the past. He is stuck back in a time where people apparently did not think smoking was a worry for public health. He is stuck back in a time before the scientific consensus became that climate change is real. On this side of the House we will continue to deal with these challenges. We will continue to do what we need to do to prepare this country for the future - accept the evidence, deal with the facts, design the policies and implement them. We are not stuck in the past and stuck in denial like the Leader of the Opposition.

   The member can find it in the budget papers. I recommend that he opens them up and has a look at them. What they do is come off. They are conservative. I am not going through the numbers in detail. What we have got here is the acute embarrassment of those opposite. I do not engage in pop quizzes in the parliament -                     -                      No, I have not bothered to look for it because there is no way in the world that I am going to spend my time in the parliament playing the games of those opposite or playing pop quizzes. What we are on about here is serious policy. What we are seeing from those on the other side of the House is that they have no alternative vision for our country -                      I do not come into this House to play pop quizzes; I come in here to argue very serious policy and we are seeing none from the other side of the House. We had a Leader of the Opposition who could not talk about jobs in his budget reply, and the same for the shadow Treasurer. Both of them failed to talk about the floods and their impact on the Australian economy, nor did they address the consequences of having our terms of trade at 140-year highs. What we have got is a group of people who are absolutely unqualified to put forward an alternative economic policy for this country and it is on display for everybody to see.

   I would like to thank the member for Canberra for her question because there has certainly been some important commentary over the last week or so in relation to climate change. In fact, two of the opposition frontbenchers have, over the last week, shredded the Leader of the Opposition's sham subsidies-for-polluters policy on climate change. The member for Wentworth I think made a very valid point last week that the whole purpose of the coalition's policy is that it can be easily dumped if you do not really accept and respect the climate science and accept the responsibility of having to deal with it. So it is a policy that can be dumped at any time and that is one of its purposes.                 The member for Wentworth also made it clear that, if the subsidies-for-polluters policy ever really went ahead, taxpayers would foot the bill to the tune of around $18 billion per year by the year 2050. This is because their policy pays polluters and taxes families to fund it. That much was confirmed by the member for Flinders, the shadow minister, last night in a quite extraordinary appearance on 7.30 where he made a number of very important admissions about the coalition policy. On the television the member for Flinders admitted that the policy was in fact temporary, that he was focussing on nothing more than a 10-year horizon for the policy potentially, which is not much good when investors are looking for certainty in long-lived assets that might have a life in the electricity-generating sector of anything from 30 to 50 years. He also made an extraordinary commitment on behalf of the coalition to subsidise electricity generators for an indefinite period of time by meeting capital and operating costs associated with the introduction of different technologies.                 Upon my request, my department has used some publicly available information to estimate the cost of the member for Flinders' commitment and it is up to $11 billion by the year 2020, with an ongoing cost after that of up to $1Â½ billion per year. So to fund that quite extraordinary multibillion dollar promise, the member for Flinders then volunteered that he would dip into the shadow Treasurer's already discredited budget savings, which is yet another blow to the shadow Treasurer's savings promises. Therefore, in one single interview, the member for Flinders exposed fundamental flaws in both the subsidies for polluters policy and their budget policy. No-one can take their climate change position seriously.                 We have heard all about, during the last few days, all of those who comment on that side on the climate science. Take, for example, the member for Indi, who was every quick to dismiss the Climate Commission's science report, making the absurd claim that this report - the report itself - will shut down Australia as a modern industrialised economy. No exaggeration in that one. She was joined by the member for Gippsland, who suggested the report was a political agenda of the government. This is an independent science commission. We have had Senator Boswell out. We have had Senator Abetz out. We have had Senator Minchin out. The fact of the matter is simple on this issue: those on that side deny the science. They will not respect the scientific evidence and they have no credible policy to deal with it.

 Of course, because we have the most negative opposition in this country's history, one of the things they refuse to do is ever to deal with the facts. As the Leader of the Opposition ought to know, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship put out a statement in relation to this matter earlier today which fully answers this question. I myself was asked questions about it by the media today and fully answered this question. I refer him to the statement that I released - the co-statement with the Prime Minister of Malaysia - which answers this question. Of course, the arrangement that we will make with Malaysia will ensure that asylum seekers who are transferred from Australia are treated with dignity and treated with respect and treated in accordance with our understanding of human rights, and of course our understanding of human rights deals with the question the Leader of the Opposition asks.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. He, like many other members of this House on both sides, joined the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and about a million Australians who take part in the Cancer Council's Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. It helps the Cancer Council to raise funds for research to prevent and control cancer.                 At this event the Leader of the Opposition urged Australians to do all that they could to tackle cancer. In fact, I can quote the Leader of the Opposition. He said, 'We should do all that we can to fight cancer.' So I have just a teensy-weensy suggestion for the Leader of the Opposition about what he could do himself. He could, for example, support our comprehensive plans to tackle tobacco, from the social marketing campaigns, the excise increase, our plain-packaging measures -                      Members of this House might be interested to know that, since there was an increase in the excise on tobacco last April, we have seen a very dramatic initial effect. In fact, from that excise change, there has been an initial drop in tobacco clearances of 8.8 per cent compared to the previous four years. Of course, all of this funding is being invested in health and hospitals. But this seems to be one of the figures that those opposite are not asking about which appears in the budget. And, very oddly, yesterday afternoon the Leader of the Opposition actually criticised this excise for tobacco. So this means a person who this morning urged all Australians to do all they could to tackle cancer now - although he is in a unique position to do something about it - opposes the tobacco excise, opposes plain packaging and even opposes bans on smoking in cars with kids. Does anyone get the feeling that the Leader of the Opposition was not being straight this morning when he made those comments? But I have another quote.                     The reason this is important today is that we are supporting the Cancer Council's efforts to raise funds to tackle cancer. Mr Abbott himself came to the event and urged all Australians, rightly, to give generously to this cause - although he did, I think, come with an empty wallet, which he wanted to make a joke about himself. However, when the Leader of the Opposition is urging other Australians to do all they can to tackle tobacco -                     We have to ask the question about why he and the Liberal Party do not support plain packaging. I went back and found a comment from Mr Abbott that may help explain this. This is the man who says: 'My parents both smoked heavily when I was a kid. Now, has it done me any harm?' That may be a very good question.                     We urge all Australians to support the Cancer Council's Biggest Morning Tea, and, to the Leader of the Opposition, we ask him to start living up to his own promises.

  It is no surprise to me, and I suspect no surprise to people on this side of the House, that we are back to the old faithful of asylum seekers today. With so many divisions on that side of the parliament to cover up, they have obviously decided to go back to the thing that they think they can profit from. It is remarkable - they are not prepared to actually engage in the kind of debate that the minister for health has outlined to the House, because that goes to a division; not prepared to engage in debate about climate change, because of their division about it; not prepared to engage in a debate about the economy, because they do not know anything about it.                     On the question, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows from the statements I have made, including the statement I made with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, we will enter with Malaysia into an innovative agreement to transfer asylum seekers so that we send a very, very strong signal to people-smugglers that they no longer have in their hands the product they wish to sell, which is the prospect that they can get asylum seekers to Australia and have their claims processed here. The arrangement with Malaysia is about that. People who are serious about dealing with the scourge of people-smuggling would understand that, and this continuing attempt by the opposition to distort the facts and raise the apprehension of Australians that somehow another country is going to determine our immigration policy is truly pathetic indeed.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question - I know that she has a motion before the House about tobacco company donations, and that debate will be very eagerly anticipated by those on this side of the House. We are leading the world in the measures that we are taking against smoking, including of course the first introduction anywhere in the world of plain packaging for tobacco.                     It is true that our policies have been influenced by people outside our party. For example, we have been influenced by researchers, by public health advocates and by the AMA. We have taken advice from the Preventative Health Taskforce and we have been strongly influenced by the Cancer Council and the Heart Foundation. None of these organisations give us money. Yet in this place, in a couple of months when we are all asked to vote on plain packaging, there will be other influences at play. The coalition denies it is being influenced by big tobacco, but I have discovered something that seems to throw this into question. It is a policy that comes from big tobacco themselves - British American Tobacco, in fact. I think some of those opposite might particularly like to hear this because, despite their protestations, British American Tobacco makes the statement on its own website that their worldwide policy when it comes to donations is:                 Such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues affecting the companyÂ _                 The Liberal and National parties deny that these contributions have any influence, but the donors say that is the only reason they can actually make a donation. Those opposite might be interested to know something else that is on this website. According to British American Tobacco's own figures, they made political donations in only three countries around the world in 2010. In Canada they made a donation of Â£1,000 and in the Solomon Islands they made a donation of Â£2,000. In Australia, they made a donation - to just two parties in this place - of Â£111,000. So 97 per cent of British American Tobacco's money is spent here on two parties - the Liberal Party and the National Party. And they are asking us to believe that this has no influence on their decision on whether they are going to support plain packaging or not! We have not taken our lead from big tobacco; it is about time the Leader of the Opposition showed that he was not able to be bought by big tobacco and stood up for those who are fighting cancer. It is time to kick the habit, Mr Abbott.                     I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The fact is that British American tobacco gives 97 per cent of its donations to those in the parties opposite - the Liberal Party and the National Party. It is time to kick the habit, Mr Abbott.

  I cannot confirm that, because it is completely untrue, as the member for Cook well knows. He has completely misrepresented the complementary protection legislation once again, as he has previously, and completely misrepresented the arrangements with Malaysia.                 I am happy to go through this methodically for the benefit of the member for Cook. The Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of Malaysia have released a statement that outlines the agreement reached by them. That statement says that Prime Ministers Najib and Gillard have agreed that core elements of this bilateral arrangement will include that 'transferees will be treated with dignity and respect and in accordance with human rights standards'. That is what the agreement between the two prime ministers says very clearly. It has been confirmed by the Malaysian High Commissioner to Australia since then that these transferees will be treated humanely under the terms of that agreement.                 The member for Cook chooses to misrepresent the situation in relation to Malaysia. The member for Cook comes in here and cries his crocodile tears about the situation for asylum seekers in Malaysia, at the same time as criticising us for taking too many asylum seekers - for taking 4,000 asylum seekers - out of Malaysia. The hypocrisy of the member for Cook is exceeded only by this point: as the House would recall, last November the member for Cook proposed an arrangement similar to that proposed by the government in relation to a transfer agreement, except that instead of Malaysia he proposed Iran. I wonder how he would have gone negotiating with President Ahmadinejad the protections that this government has negotiated.

  I thank the member for New England for his question and I think we all join together in congratulating him on his 20 years of service. This is a very important question and, like the member for New England, I think I can say that all members of this House agree that it is critical that we work together to provide alternative accommodation to young people who have been inappropriately housed in nursing homes in the past. As the member for New England has just outlined, too many people continue to be in nursing homes even when they are quite young.                 I can reassure the member for New England that the government is continuing to provide funding to the Young People in Residential Care Program. In fact, this year we are delivering around $38 million to the states and territories to assist them to move people into more appropriate accommodation so that young people can live with dignity in places that are more suited to their needs. I also want to reassure the member for New England and all members of this House that that funding is ongoing. I know there have been some concerns about that, but I can reassure him that that funding is in our budget out into the future. It is funded as part of the $6.2 billion National Disability Agreement. One of the important changes that this government has made is to improve the indexation of the funding that goes into that agreement. The indexation now is around six per cent, so we can certainly see that money growing as the years go on.                  It is very important that I let you know that, just last December at a meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory disability ministers, we reaffirmed our continuing commitment to address the needs of young people in nursing homes. In addition to that, the government announced in the election campaign that we would invest an extra $60 million to build up to 150 innovative community based accommodation places for people with disability. I anticipate that most of those places will go to young people. So we certainly recognise, with the member for New England - and I think I can confidently say that this is a view held by many in this House - that we do need to continue to help those young people who are inappropriately in nursing homes to find better and more appropriate accommodation where they can live with dignity.

  I thank the member for Calwell for her question on the very important topic of using facts and evidence to design policies. The Australian people can be reassured that this government is acting on the basis of the facts and the evidence rather than peddling fear as we see this negative opposition do. On climate change, the scientific evidence is in and it is beyond doubt. The science tells us that human emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the most important, have been the primary trigger of climate change since at least the 1950s. The science tells us that current carbon emissions are 37 per cent larger than they were in the 1990s. The science is telling us to act and we are determined to act.                 When we turn to the question of cigarette smoking, the science is also unbelievably clear. Smoking kills over 15,000 Australians per year. It is the leading cause of cancer and we do know from scientific studies that plain paper packaging will make a difference. We have accepted the evidence.                  But on the other side we see a complete denial of the evidence. They would rather peddle fear than deal with the facts and deal with the evidence. We know that Senator Nick Minchin has been out leading the sceptics within the opposition denying the science of climate change and we know that the opposition is refusing to accept the scientific studies which show the way in which plain packaging will make a difference. I would say to those opposite, and particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, that they should not continue to oppose effective action on climate change and they should not oppose further action to reduce smoking rates in our society.                 The confusion on the opposition side knows no bounds. We actually increased the excise on smoking because the science told us that it would reduce smoking rates. That was clear. And at one point, the shadow minister for health agreed with us. Indeed, he was agreeing with us as recently as 24 May - that is, this week he was agreeing with us. He was saying that he proposed, along with the Leader of the Opposition, an increase of $2 billion in excise because pricing works. But then the Leader of the Opposition actually unravelled that support for an excise increase when he spoke -                      I thank the opposition for so visibly demonstrating my point in the last few minutes: they do not listen. They did not listen to the question, they do not listen to the scientists, they do not absorb any facts - they just do not care. The little shambles we just saw over there, where they were joking about whether smoking causes climate change, should cause Australians to recoil in horror, because what it means is that the opposition could not care less about either. They do not care about climate change; they are sceptics. They do not care about smoking; they are too big on the drip from big tobacco to take anything about smoking seriously.                   Maybe the smoke that they care about is the smoke that shows there is a fire of division over there in the opposition. We have the division on display at the end of this week: the Leader of the Opposition versus the shadow Treasurer; the Leader of the Opposition versus the member for Wentworth; the Leader of the Opposition versus the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; and the famous five who have been singled out for criticism by the Chief Opposition Whip. They are a divided opposition who are incapable of taking in facts and evidence and incapable of designing a policy for the nation's future.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. No, I will not direct the Grants Commission to do that, and for the shadow Treasurer to try, as he has done in this House in the past few days, to draw some comparison between a previous direction and the current situation represents a complete misunderstanding by those on that side of the House of what is going on in terms of the taxation of fines in Western Australia.                 There are fines which are covered by state agreements, and the direction I gave to the Grants Commission related to fines covered by state agreements; it did not relate to other fines. Now that the Western Australian government itself has decided to treat all fines equally - that is, the fines covered by state agreements and the other fines - so should the Grants Commission. That is the factual situation that those opposite have not understood at any stage through this debate. They have been on a frolic about it, but the situation is now clear to everybody: the Western Australian government on eight occasions leading up to its budget a couple of weeks ago said to the public that it would not be increasing the royalty on fines. Eight times it said that prior to the budget, when it increased the royalty for fines. It even made a submission to the Grants Commission at the end of last year saying that it would not do it and that, if that action were taken, it would lead to a sovereign risk.                 That is why those on the outside of the House are so embarrassed at the moment. This time last year they were running around Australia claiming that we were going to tax the mining companies too much and that they were being taxed too much already, but now we have the Western Australian Premier going out and doing precisely what they have opposed: taxing the mining companies by increasing royalties, and that has been denied by the Western Australian Premier on eight occasions.                 Those opposite simply do not understand what they are talking about in this area, and they are acutely embarrassed by the behaviour of the Western Australian government and by their own behaviour in this House. Of course, on this question they are divided. We can see that every day. They are even too divided to turn up to their own divisions.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question. The government is endeavouring to implement its election commitment to give farmers and landholders access to carbon markets. Under the carbon farming initiative, which is currently before the House, farmers and landholders and foresters have the opportunity to develop projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars to store and reduce carbon in our landscape. This is very important legislation that has been welcomed in particular by the National Farmers Federation for the reasons that I have outlined.                 It is very surprising therefore that the coalition yesterday signalled that it wants to delay the bill. This is despite the fact that the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Flinders, has been understandably enthusiastic about the carbon farming initiative and has been trying to reassure stakeholders that he would deliver the support of the coalition for this initiative. However, it is now clear that that reassurance cannot be delivered on and that there is division on that side of politics about this important issue.                     They simply cannot get their act together over something that would provide a revenue stream for farmers and assist in tackling climate change. Notwithstanding the support of the NFF and the potential benefits to farmers, the Leader of the Nationals told the House yesterday that the Carbon Farming Initiative was 'just another tree planting scheme.' He then widely briefed the media that the Nationals did not support the Carbon Farming Initiative. If the Nationals leader had bothered to have a look he would have found out that the Carbon Farming Initiative will not lead to trees usurping prime agricultural land, because the government has built significant safeguards into the legislation to prevent that from occurring. Those safeguards have been the subject of extensive consultation with the stakeholders.                     I hear the Leader of the Opposition raising the issue of the details. The government has already begun to release the methodologies to provide guidance to project development and has provided the details of eligible and ineligible project activities relevant to land use. Instead of delaying a positive initiative for farmers, the coalition would be better off having a look at the effect of their own subsidies-for-polluters policy because that is where a deep problem lies.                 The Leader of the Opposition has been running around with his scare campaign saying that we can deal with climate change by planting trees everywhere. I am surprised that the Nationals leader has not picked this up. To meet their current emissions reduction target under their own subsidies-for-polluters policy, the coalition would need to plant trees on an area larger than the entire crop land of this country. I suggest that if the Nationals are concerned about the use of prime agricultural land they should have a little look at the subsidies-for-polluters policy.                 They are a joke on these areas of policy. They are divided on all the big issues. They are run by climate science deniers. They cannot get their act together even on an issue that would be of significant benefit to the farmers of this country. Get your act together.

  I can certainly tell the shadow Treasurer that all of us on this side of the House are in favour of exporting coal. It seems like a common-sense thing to do. One of the reasons we need to put a price on carbon is to ensure that all of our industries, including our coal industry, can get access to international markets and also be competitive in international markets. That is the objective of everybody on the side of the House, but those opposite want to stick their heads in the sand because they are not capable of facing up to the really big decisions that we must make as a nation to ensure we remain competitive.                 The coal industry is one of our most important industries. We on this side of the House are strong supporters of the coal industry. We understand that the coal industry, like so many of our other industries, must be competitive. That is why we need a price on carbon. As the rest of the world prices carbon and we do not, our industries and exports could face trade barriers. Of course, the one that would be most under threat from that would be the coal industry. I am optimistic about the future of our coal industry because we have some of the cleanest coal in the world. As the world moves to renewable energy it will still require traditional energy and our coal will be highly valued in that environment. In an environment where carbon is priced and where investment is driven to renewable energy there will still be a role for coal and a very big role for the Australian coal industry.

  I thank the member for Robertson for that very important question. There is some data out today that says a lot about the future of our economy, the future of growth here and our prospects well into the future. The fact is we do have an unprecedented investment pipeline in Australia. Today's capital expenditure numbers show that businesses are confidently investing in growing their businesses. In resources alone investment has gone from $35 billion in 2009-10 to more than $50 billion in 2010-11. This is expected to increase even further in 2011-12 to a record $83 billion, eight times greater than it was before the mining boom mark 1.                 Total investment in 2010-11 is estimated to be $124 billion, with a record $139.5 billion expected in 2011-12. This is a very strong investment pipeline. It was also backed up today by ABARE's figures, which are talking about an investment pipeline in resources of $430 billion. It is a very strong investment pipeline, but we are all aware, certainly on this side of the House, that there was a very dramatic impact on our economy from the floods back in January and also from Cyclone Yasi. This was ignored by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply. It is probably the most significant event in the Australian economy in the past year and it did not even get a mention in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, much to the embarrassment of all the Queensland members over there, because the impact of Cyclone Yasi and the floods has been to rip $9 billion out of our economy in the short term. That will mean a dramatic impact on growth in the March quarter, and we will see that next week in the national accounts.                 But these CAPEX numbers today are a reminder to all of us of the great opportunity that lies ahead for Australia: a strong growth outlook, low unemployment and strong job creation - 260,000 jobs in the past year alone, with about 80 per cent of them being full time. During the time this government has been in power 700,000 jobs have been created and we are looking at another 500,000 jobs in the next two and a bit years. Everybody on this side of the House understands the importance of a job to the welfare of families and to the security of businesses. We understand it, but it is not understood by those on the other side of the House. That is why we are so intent on bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is why making savings in the budget is so important. We have this strong investment pipeline and we cannot compound the inflationary pressures that will flow from it. That is why the government savings must pass: to keep jobs secure and to make sure that we are maximising the opportunities for the future. That is why we must have a disciplined fiscal policy and not something we see from those opposite - there is no policy at all.                 And that is why we must put a price on carbon. It will give certainty for investors. But those on the other side of the House are not capable at all of facing up to the big decisions, particularly this Leader of the Opposition. He wants to run a negative campaign day after day. For our part we will get on with supporting our economy, putting the right policies in place, supporting jobs and families.

  I thank the member for his question. As the House might recall, in 2007 the then Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, now our ambassador in NATO, announced the acquisition of three air warfare destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy. This government, in the Defence white paper 2009, confirmed that we would proceed with the acquisition of these three new ships, and they ships are currently due for delivery in December 2014. When complete, the air warfare destroyer will be one of the more capable types of warship of its size in the world. They provide advance air defence against missiles and aircraft for self-protection, as well as for other ships and for land forces in coastal areas.                 The total cost of the project is about $8 billion, with a significant benefit for local Australian industry. Overall, the estimate is that around 50 per cent of the total value of the project will be spent in Australia. The ships are being constructed in 90 separate blocks, which are being fabricated in three separate Australian shipyards: in Adelaide at the ASC shipyard, in Melbourne at the BAE Systems shipyard and in Newcastle at the Forgacs shipyard. They will ultimately be assembled in Adelaide.                 Today, the Minister for Defence Materiel and I announced a reallocation of work for that project. This is necessary because, in addition to the air warfare destroyer work, the Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard is also building blocks for the superstructure for the two new landing helicopter dock ships due for delivery in 2014-15. The Melbourne shipyard is stretched, working on two major projects at the same time. The government, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance and BAE Systems takes the schedule for these two very important projects most seriously. In February of this year, BAE Systems advised the AWD Alliance of potential schedule delays. As a consequence of that, I met with BAE Systems United Kingdom in London in March of this year. The Minister for Defence Materiel speaks regularly to the CEO of BAE Systems Australia, Jim McDowell, and on this particular matter has met and spoken with him on a number of occasions in recent months.                 Over the last few months the AWD Alliance and BAE Systems have been working very closely to prepare options to improve the production outcomes, and earlier this month BAE Systems presented the alliance with a plan to adjust this workload on the air warfare destroyer project. The advice of the alliance was that if no action were taken to relieve the pressure on the Melbourne shipyard the first ship would be two years late. As a consequence of these discussions and that possible outcome, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance, with the support of BAE Systems and with the support of the Minister for Defence Materiel and I, propose to take the following action.                 Firstly, up to 13 steel blocks will be reallocated among the three Australian shipyards in Adelaide, Melbourne and Newcastle and up to five blocks will be reallocated to Navantia in Ferrol, Spain. This action will reduce the schedule risk for both this project and the LHD, landing helicopter dock, ships project. The Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance has advised that this action will reduce the estimated delay of the completion of the first ship by up to 12 months and all three AWDs by the same period. It will also reduce the pressure on BAE Systems to complete its work on the LHD ships.                 Importantly, I am advised that there will be little, if any, adverse impact on the current Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard workforce, which is around 300, as a result of this decision. That workforce will continue to have the opportunity to work on the AWDs as well as the landing helicopter docks, and that is a good thing for Melbourne as it is a good thing for Adelaide and Newcastle.

  Through a prudent fiscal policy and strict fiscal discipline, and working with state governments who will have to bear their share of the burden. We will do that in both those ways. I will tell you what: we have shown a lot more interest in the Pacific Highway than those opposite. I happen to know our commitments are much larger than theirs, and we have put them all in our budget and they are all funded.                 We have a commitment and a priority for the Pacific Highway that those opposite never had. The other thing that they will not do is tell anybody how they are going to fund any of their commitments. How would they fund the Pacific Highway?                     As someone who has travelled the Pacific Highway a lot in my life, one of the things that I am proudest of in this budget is the commitment of $1 billion to the Pacific Highway. I am really proud of that. I am proud of the performance of our roads minister here, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, who has made a very big commitment to the Pacific Highway and, of course, the Independent members, who have a real interest in this highway. I know how dangerous this highway is because I am a Queenslander and I have driven it all my life. We have a commitment there that has not been there from those opposite. Our total commitment is $4.1 billion, compared to the Howard government's $1.3 billion. That is the answer to your question.

  I thank the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, for his question. Indeed, as of today, at 1.30, we have passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House - 112 supported, zero opposed by this House of Representatives. And we have done that in just eight months. How does that compare with our predecessors? Those opposite would like to say that this parliament cannot function properly because it requires proper negotiation. The fact is that in the first 12 months of the Howard government 108 bills were passed by the House of Representatives, so we have been more efficient and more productive on this side of the House in terms of getting legislation through. Big changes have gone through the House, on the economy, on child care, on family services. This parliament is working efficiently and effectively. Through cooperation and discipline, this government is implementing its agenda to secure the future prosperity of this country.                 Of course, we know that discipline is pretty important. I was sent an email earlier on today and it said this:                 Last night we lost a division because the following five Coalition Members failed to support their colleagues:                 Malcolm Turnbull (5 missed divisions) - margin 14.86%                 He has always had a problem with emails!                     It then goes on to list Ian Macfarlane, Alby Schultz and the number of divisions that they have missed, then John Forrest - even Luke Hartsuyker, the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. And it goes on to say this:                 This behaviour is totally unacceptable and shows great disrespect to their colleagues and the Coalition as a whole.                 As a result of the absence of these Members, the following Members missed an opportunity to raise issues important to their electorates _                 And it goes through the members Tudge, Kelly, Simpkins, Southcott and Frydenberg and their respective margins. It then goes on - and it gets better. It says:                 It is an interesting point to note that all the Members who missed the division occupy safe seats, while, of the Members prevented from speaking in the adjournment debate three are first term Members and all occupy marginal or key seats.                 It then goes on to say:                 Members are elected to Parliament to represent their constituents. That includes being present when the Parliament divides on a question.                 As we know, they are so divided opposite they cannot even make it to divisions.                 For the benefit of honourable members, I table the signed letter from Hon. Warren Entsch, Chief Opposition Whip, Patrick Secker, Nola Marino, Mark Coulton and Paul Neville. They are all having a go there, and I know that this was of great interest particularly to the member for Wentworth, who saw it as part of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer - lots of noise, interesting at the beginning but annoying when that is the only noise it can make. The only noise it can make is one of opposition.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for that question. The government absolutely understands the concern felt by electricity consumers about price rises that are occurring under the regulatory framework that has been in place not just under this government but under the past government. The member for Boothby is trying to draw a link between these price rises and the impact of a carbon price we do not yet have. That demonstrates what a baseless scare campaign they are engaged in. The fact is that there are pressures in the system and prices are going up and that is putting pressures on families. The opposition seek to say that is somehow a consequence of decisions that have been taken by this government. They know that to be completely false.                     On the eve of the last election, the member for Groom was openly honest about this, which is rare for the opposition. He said that prices are going up, and he said why: because there has not been sufficient investment in the network. They are very embarrassed about this statement from the member for Groom.                     Everybody in this House knows that prices are going up and it has been caused by inadequate investment in the system over a long period of time. Those opposite might seek to deny it now, but they were open about it prior to the last election. For them to go out there now and run a baseless scare campaign somehow linking it to a future carbon price demonstrates just how dishonest they are. They know that the country has to face up to this tough decision. The government will face up to this decision. We will take a responsible decision in the interests of all consumers.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that in the electorate she represents, which has some 2,068 very long term unemployed people, they will certainly welcome the additional assistance we have announced. We on this side are very proud of the 700,000 jobs that have been created since we have been in government. But we also see that, as we head towards an unemployment rate of some 4.5 per cent with an additional 500,000 jobs to be created in the coming years, this provides us with a unique opportunity. As a nation, we are faced with a unique chance to transform the lives of the very long term unemployed and to break the cycle of welfare dependency. As a government, we are absolutely determined that we are not going to leave anyone behind in this period of growth.                 In this year's budget the government is investing an additional $227.9 million in new measures to specifically target the very long term unemployed. In Australia, currently 230,000 people are classified as very long term unemployed. We know that once a job seeker has been unemployed for one year they have a 54 per cent chance of being unemployed for at least another year; so we need to step in and break this cycle. Of the new funding, $94.6 million will be used to create 35,000 wage subsidies to be paid to employers who take on and retain people who have been unemployed for more than two years. This will create powerful new opportunities across the nation. These subsidies, totalling around $6,000 each, will be paid for at least six months and will be available to both private businesses and social enterprises, creating the opportunity to transform the lives of very long term unemployed Australians and those of their family members and their communities.                 We also know that people who have been unemployed for a very long period can have difficulty accessing full-time work, because they often do not have the work experience and skills that employers are looking for. We know that a lack of activity is detrimental to people's health and wellbeing and undermines their job readiness, so the government is putting in place stronger requirements and more resources in order to keep the very long term unemployed active and job ready. Under previous arrangements of both this government and the previous government, job seekers only had to meet activity requirements for six months each year. Those who are now very long term unemployed will in future, under this government, be required to be active in their engagement for 11 months each year. Those job seekers will be required to undertake activities like job training, volunteering, job trials and Work for the Dole if they are to continue to be eligible for income support. We are allocating some $133 million through this budget to fund these activities.                 We know the Australian economy needs workers if we are going to take advantage of the minerals boom and manage the challenges of an ageing population. This presents a very great opportunity for Australians who have been out of work for a large amount of time, who face significant barriers to re-engagement in the labour market. Our government is determined to provide those Australians with the incentives and the support they need in order to get back into the labour market. We are proud to have presented a budget directed towards this.

  I thank the member for his question because putting in place a price on carbon is a very significant and fundamental reform for the future of our country. In the past when this country has faced up to the challenges before it and put in place very significant reforms, like we did in the late eighties and early nineties, there were always very big scare campaigns being run during those times, particularly by those opposite. And they are at it again. The fact is that our economy would not have come through the global recession in the shape that it did if it had not been for the actions that were put in place during that period, particularly reforms like national superannuation, which was so important to get us through the global recession. The point I want to make is that you have to face up to the hard reforms if you want to be honest with people. If you want to talk to people about the future, you cannot put the hard reforms in the too-hard basket.                     I was explaining why we need to put a price on carbon. It is because it is absolutely essential to the job security of Australians and our future prosperity. That is why the government is engaging in a thorough consultation with the wider community, the multiparty committee and the business community. We are working closely to design an emissions trading scheme.                 This parliament was within hours of an emissions trading scheme the year before last when the member for Wentworth decided that he could not do it and the Leader of the Opposition knocked him off. The fact is that this country has to price carbon. We on this side of the House believe in doing something about dangerous climate change -                      unlike those on that side of the House, who are now dominated by the climate change deniers and led by the Leader of the Opposition.                     So we will go through a consultation process to design an emissions trading scheme which is fair to the country, fair to households and fair to business.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Today is National Sorry Day, as the parliament has noted. It is more than three years since the historic apology to the stolen generation, one of the most important moments in the history of this parliament - in fact, in our history. The acknowledgement of past injustices and the commitment to the healing journey means that we now must redouble our efforts to close the gap. Not only today with National Sorry Day but with the beginning of reconciliation week, I think we as a nation have an opportunity to recognise the past, to understand that there was injustice and suffering, and to know that we are on the path to healing.                 I did note my colleagues the Minister for Indigenous Health and the member for Lingiari reminding Australians that we are providing continuing support of some $54 million for programs to help the Bringing them home generation, the Link Up program and others. Right across Australia we will see Australian schools - public schools, independent schools and Catholic schools - having ceremonies that recognise and highlight the heritage of the first peoples, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These are terrific events. They create the opportunity for a more optimistic future. It means that young people, by participating in these events, are well placed to continue this reconciliation journey and to participate in it.                 We know that we are profoundly committed to closing the gap, and education is the key. It means work, training and further study. It means independence, opportunity and hope. The fact is that education breaks the poverty cycle, a cycle that is experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We know the gap between the educational outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is unacceptably large, but we also know that there are some really good things happening out there in Australian schools that are changing lives. Yes, the national statistics tell us a sobering story, but the efforts of many of our schools, using the $2.5 billion national partnerships money that this government has brought forward, is encouraging.                 Let me just identify a few of those encouraging stories. In Western Australia, 94 per cent of participating national partnerships schools are reporting improved engagement and participation of Aboriginal parents and communities. In the Hume region in Victoria, literacy intervention programs are seeing Indigenous student participation in year 3 NAPLAN reading move to over 90 per cent. In New South Wales we have Aboriginal community engagement strategies implemented in over 270 schools. Ninety-three have now got Aboriginal elders or community members working with teachers. That makes a big difference in a school. Two hundred and forty-four teachers from all the education sectors are undertaking Aboriginal education and cultural programs. Over 1,200 government school teachers are participating in training courses to support Aboriginal students. This makes a huge difference. The investment makes a huge difference. Sometimes there is one committed person who can make a difference.                   To finish, my favourite story is of the Elliott School in the remote Northern Territory, which employs a 71-year-old woman as a home liaison officer. She visits family homes and talks to kids, parents and carers. There was an average attendance of 60 per cent in semester 2 in 2009; it is now 72 per cent and their NAPLAN results are showing improvements. I think that this investment and some of the examples I have highlighted show what an important role education plays. In this House, we are committed to reconciliation and continuing the investment to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say that his conduct in this parliament in the first 30 seconds of question time justifies John Hewson's description of him as the 'master of the negative'. That is all the Leader of the Opposition knows. Even his fellow Liberals can no longer stomach his negativity and hollowness. The reason we saw those divisions is that when you stand for nothing it is easy to be divided, isn't it? There is no sense of purpose and no sense of unity, because under this Leader of the Opposition they stand for nothing.                 Let me say the following to the Leader of the Opposition: I believe climate change is real; I know the Leader of the Opposition does not. I believe that because climate change is real we should have the cheapest and most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution. Economists tell us that the cheapest and most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon -                      and get the business in our nation that are big businesses and big polluters to pay that price -                      not households and not taxpayers but big businesses that are big polluters. There are fewer than 1,000 of them. Then, because there is a price on that carbon pollution and they can no longer put it up into the atmosphere for nothing, because they are smart business people and because they are driven by the bottom line they will find ways of innovating and changing their business practices -                      so that they generate less carbon pollution. We will use the revenue paid by those big polluters to assist Australian families. We will use it to protect Australian jobs. We will use it to fund programs that tackle climate change.                 The Leader of the Opposition stands for a proposition that the member for Wentworth has rightly described as one that is expensive for taxpayers and will not work. It is the kind of policy you put forward when you do not really believe in climate change and your main aim is to have a policy that you can fool people with and you can bring to an end very quickly if you were ever required to implement it.                 Look at the contrasts in our policies. We will require big polluters to pay and give some of that money to Australian families -                      whereas the Leader of the Opposition will get Australian families to pay through increased tax and give that money to the big polluters. To the Leader of the Opposition I say that as the Liberal Party increasingly develops a sense of shame about his political tactics -                      it is now time for the Leader of the Opposition to stop this fear campaign and deal with the issue that confronts this nation and confronts this planet, and that is to effectively tackle climate change.

  I very much thank the member for Greenway for her question. Earlier today I was able to go to the Ravenswood School and meet with young women who are engaged in the 10,000 Teens campaign. It is part of a broader campaign to bring together one million women to raise their voice about climate change.                      I would have thought the member for Bradfield would want the views of his constituents to be heard in the Australian parliament. I talked to his constituents today and I am bringing their views to the Australian parliament. I would have thought he would be interested in the views of his own constituents. At Ravenswood today, I participated in an event that was about bringing together one million Australian women who will raise their voices on climate change, one million women who will take a pledge in their personal lives to cut the amount of carbon pollution that they generate - grandmothers and mothers, aunts and sisters, banding together to have their voices heard about the need to tackle climate change. And the 10,000 Teens campaign is about young women having their voice heard too, so that they can say to their mothers and grandmothers, to their aunts and to their older sisters: 'Thank you for taking action on climate change. We want our voice heard as well.'                 Ravenswood is one of around 30 schools in New South Wales involved in the 10,000 Teens campaign. Through that campaign and more broadly around the Australian nation - in Sydney, in the outer suburbs and in regional towns - we are hearing Australians say they believe climate change is real and they want to see effective action on climate change. Effective action through pricing carbon, effective action through making the big polluters pay, is what this government stands for and it is what we will bring to the Australian parliament. What people do not want to hear is a whole lot of negativity, a whole lot of fear mongering, a whole lot of bitterness from a divided political party. What they want to hear is real solutions. I visit a lot of schools and I very much enjoy doing so. Whenever I go to schools, I talk to the kids about the partnership that we the adults in this community have with them. We tell them to study hard and we have to provide them with great schools to study in. We say to them: 'When you leave school, don't drift around. Get a job or go into that new educational opportunity' - and we have to do the right thing to make sure the economy is strong and they can get the benefit of that great new training opportunity. And on climate change they are saying to us: 'Please act to do the things that we need to do to cut carbon pollution in this nation.' I am listening to their voice, the government is listening to their voice, and we will act by pricing carbon.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know - from news reports, from the briefings that she reads and, indeed, from the information she would get from the sister political parties of the Liberal Party around the world - other nations are moving on climate change. I am sure, for example, that there is a great exchange of information between the Liberal Party of Australia and the Conservatives in the United Kingdom. Indeed, we know that the Leader of the Opposition has been to the UK to consult with David Cameron, now the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. People would remember when he went to do that. What does David Cameron stand for? This is a man who, were in Australia, would be the holder of a Liberal Party ticket. He has announced to his community that he stands for cutting carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2027 - a conservative. But we do not need to look as far away as the UK. We can look across the ditch to New Zealand - another conservative. The Prime Minister there, John Key -                      I presumed the opposition would be interested in the actions of their fellow conservatives overseas, including of course the Prime Minister of New Zealand - a conservative in a country with an emissions trading scheme. Then let's come to the US, mentioned in the deputy opposition leader's question. President Obama has committed the US to a hugely ambitious agenda about ensuring that 80 per cent of the energy used in the US comes from clean energy sources - a huge agenda for change. Right around the world, whether it is China or India, we see countries acting on climate change.                 I do not put the case to the Australian people that we should act in front of the world, but we cannot afford to be left behind either. We have a high-emitting economy. We emit more carbon pollution per head of population -                      than any other developed nation. That means, in generating a clean energy economy for the future, we have got a bigger journey to travel, and that is why we need to start the journey now. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Liberal Party generally are out there trying to stoke fear on this issue. They have got no solutions; they have got no belief in climate change; they have got no views about the future of this country. All they stand for is relentless negativity, to the disgust of many people who hold a Liberal Party ticket. We will meet their fear campaign with facts. As we design carbon pricing, we will be working with Australian businesses and industry to ensure that we protect Australian jobs.                 If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is truly concerned about the employment prospects of Australians today and Australians tomorrow then she should be supporting the most efficient way of tackling climate change: pricing carbon and generating the clean energy economy we need for the future. She should not be advocating a strategy which would have our nation left behind, including behind countries where her conservative counterparts are taking positive action on climate change.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. The government, as the Prime Minister has just outlined, is determined to make a very important reform to our economy for the benefit of our long-term competitiveness and the benefit of our environment by placing a price on carbon. Of course, we are pursuing that reform through the discussions that we are holding within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. The context of that policy is that -                      a price on carbon will apply to fewer than 1,000 of the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy, and every cent raised by the payment of the carbon price by those entities will go to assisting households meet any price impacts, supporting jobs and competitiveness in the trade exposed part of the economy and supporting clean energy programs. It is important, in reference to the previous question as well, to bear in mind that it has been the clear position from the outset that there will be support for businesses that are working in the emissions-intensive and trade exposed part of the economy.                 Furthermore, it is very important to understand in pricing carbon that it will make cleaner energy sources cheaper relative to higher polluting sources of energy. That is a very important basis for pricing carbon in the economy. The discussions that we are having through the multi-party committee are constructive. Of course, there are some issues that we continue to work through, but all parties are approaching these discussions in good faith.                     You can still participate. Change your mind; get on board; show some respect for the scientific evidence. The government will continue to work through those issues with the other parties in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee.                 On the weekend we heard from 15 of Australia's top energy companies, including AGL, BP Solar, GE and TRUenergy, who all called for the urgent introduction of a price on carbon to provide certainty for business to invest in clean energy projects and jobs. We have also heard from peak bodies representing Australian business and industry. It is relevant to the debate that the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group both support a market mechanism to put a price on carbon, and they have not supported the coalition's subsidies-for-polluters policy.                 In addition, today there are a number of members of the 'Say Yes' to carbon pricing campaign in Canberra, representing a wide range of Australian people and Australian organisations. That group includes two former Liberal leaders, one of whom is former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. I am also referring to former Liberal leader John Hewson. Amongst the group are representatives from environment groups, unions, economists, academics, farmers, doctors and sports people. They collectively signed a letter today calling for a price on carbon. Dr Hewson had this to say at a press conference today in relation to this:                 Look, you've got to price carbon as the centrepiece for any adequate response to the challenge of climate change.                 Dr Hewson is, in the true tradition of market economists that have guided philosophy on the other side of the House for a long period of time, very unlike the current Leader of the Opposition, who has no faith in market mechanisms and refuses to accept the scientific evidence on climate change.

   I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. As I have already indicated to the House, I was in his electorate this morning talking to his constituents, who want to see action on climate change. And of course the most effective way of acting on climate change is to put a price on carbon paid by the big polluters so that they will change the way they operate their businesses and cut the amount of carbon pollution. We will then use that revenue to assist households to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs to tackle climate change and generate our clean energy future.                 The member for Bradfield may want to consult his constituents about these questions and when he does he may want to say to them that he follows an opposition leader who denies the science of climate change and that fellow Liberals, who hold the same party ticket as the member for Bradfield, are disgusted by the continuing negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. They cannot believe that a man can be so empty and so hollow.                     As I said to the member for Bradfield, we are going to act on climate change and we are going to do it with full understanding about circumstances around the world. Yes, I am aware of the change that the member for Bradfield refers to. The governor is a Republican. He is from a sister political party, which would only make me conclude that when the sister political parties get together from across the world - Prime Minister David Cameron, standing for 50 per cent reductions in emissions by 2027; Arnold Schwarzenegger, now in the news for a few other matters, as the Governor of California, having stood for reducing carbon pollution; the Prime Minister of New Zealand, a conservative standing for an emissions trading scheme - it is going to be a pretty interesting discussion, isn't it? But the important thing that should come out of that discussion is that conservatives like David Cameron have had the foresight to say to their people, 'Climate change is real.'                  I believe that; David Cameron believes that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. We need to get on by cutting carbon pollution. I believe that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. The most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on it. I believe that; the Leader of the Opposition does not. As we transition to a cleaner energy future, I believe in assisting Australian households; the Leader of the Opposition does not. He believes in putting additional taxes on their shoulders so that he can take that money and pay it to the big polluters as a subsidy. I am very happy to keep arguing for a positive path to address climate change.

  The member's question goes to an announced grant by the coalition government early in 2007 by the then member for Groom, as minister for resources and energy, and the member for Wentworth, as minister for the environment. It was actually announced during a time when the coalition, led by Prime Minister Howard, actually believed in policy rather than being a policy-free zone, which is the area in which the coalition finds itself. I also remind the House that at the time the coalition, which was led by a leader who believed in making hard decisions on policy, was committed to putting a price on carbon.                  The question goes to the heart of how we as a community can make a breakthrough on clean energy. Clearly, we appreciate and understand that the electricity sector is not only an essential service to the Australian community but also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Our government is committed not just to trying to take forward the debate on clean energy technology but also to putting in place a market mechanism based on a price on carbon side by side with a renewable energy target, which creates a framework for the market to work out the best form of clean energy. In that context, we regard the original announcements by the then coalition government as part of our endeavours for a $5 billion commitment to clean energy technology to take forward our opportunities for a baseload reliable energy sector in Australia which is also premised on reducing emissions.                 Regarding the question raised by the member, I remind him that it was part of a potential range of grants by the then coalition government that included Solar Systems, which was a solar power opportunity based at Abbotsford in his electorate of Melbourne. I will continue to progress the HRL proposal in the same way in which I will progress the Solar Systems proposal now taken over by Silex because of a failure of the Solar Systems investors with respect to their capacity to commercialise that solar opportunity.                 Let's go to the facts around where the HRL proposal is at the moment. Firstly, the EPA Victoria's part approval of HRL-Dual Gas Pty Ltd does not trigger any Commonwealth payment. Secondly, no low-emissions development funds have been paid to the project to date. Thirdly, the government is continuing discussions with Dual Gas and the Victorian government as to where we go with the project in the future. In essence, we will continue to work with the proponent and the Victorian government to assess whether this project meets the conditions precedent established by the coalition government not only with respect to the HRL project but also, I might say, with respect to the original announcements going to Solar Systems, a solar based opportunity to actually make a breakthrough on clean energy.                 I will continue to apprise the House as we advance the capacity of these projects that meet the conditions precedent established by the original announcements in terms of both HRL and Solar Systems.

  I thank the member for that very important question. We know that the recent natural disasters have had a significant impact on our economy, but these events have not knocked our economy off its path. Our fundamentals are strong because we have low and falling unemployment, we have record terms of trade and we have an unprecedented investment pipeline. We saw that with the capex data last week and we saw it with the ABARES data as well. We have a record investment boom which is going to stretch the capacity of our economy. That is why we have put in place measures to support our workforce for the future and that is why we put in place some tough savings measures to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is also why we put in place something like $22 billion worth of savings over the forward estimates.                 It was very important to do all of that, but it stands in stark contrast to the approach of those opposite, who have no plan to bring the budget back to surplus and no plan for jobs. We have seen today this absolutely extraordinary effort by the shadow Treasurer, who started to blame all of his colleagues for the shocker that he had at the Press Club.                     I was talking about the importance of coming back to surplus. Nothing could be more important to our economy. Of course, those opposite have no plan to come back to surplus and I simply made the point that in the Financial Review today the shadow Treasurer was blaming all of his colleagues for the fact that they have no plan to come back to surplus.                     This morning we had the incredible sight of the shadow Treasurer writing to the Financial Review saying it was not all his fault; it was all the work of Mr Robb and all the work of the Leader of the Opposition. But he did say they described it as a very good speech.                     This is pretty important because, as Ben Packham said today in the Australian: 'Some Liberals believe the letter is evidence of Mr Hockey's frustration at what he sees as Mr Abbott's lack of interest in economics.'                     Like Dr Hewson and so many on that side of the House, they know the Leader of the Opposition does not have any positive alternatives for our economy.                     Mr Speaker, I am talking about the importance of bringing our budget back to surplus and the fact that those opposite do not have a clue -                      I was asked about credible economic plans for the future, the importance of bringing a budget back to surplus, why that is important because of the investment pipeline that we have coming in place, and the need to lift pressure on all of the elements associated with the workforce and so on to support our workforce. All of those things are policies which are opposed by those opposite. You can only laugh when the shadow Treasurer has to blame his colleagues for his incompetent performance.

  The government has commissioned modelling to deal with the creation of an emissions trading scheme; that is public knowledge, and we are awaiting that modelling. That modelling is conducted by professionals in the Treasury, and they are the very same people relied upon by those opposite when the former government, under Prime Minister Howard, was putting forward an emissions trading scheme. We will await the results of that modelling and that modelling will be made public, so I can say that to everybody in the House and to all of the Australian people. We will make the modelling available. Whether it has been conducted by Mr Stern or whether it has been conducted by Garnaut, modelling has shown that the cost of inaction is far higher than the cost of action. We know all of that and we also know that what the Prime Minister said before is just so true. The sooner we begin to move, the more important it is that we can have a gradual adjustment, because as a developed economy -

  I thank the member for Wills for his question. As he might be aware, but it appears that the Leader of the Opposition has not been, the government actually released draft legislation for plain packaging nearly two months ago, on 7 April. This legislation will restrict industry logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text and increase warning labels on the front of packs from 30 per cent to 75 per cent. This is the exposure draft in all its 86 pages of detail. Australians still have another week to comment on this exposure draft legislation, and we have to date received many submissions. Unfortunately, even with all of this information available, the Leader of the Opposition says he cannot possibly make up his mind whether he will support plain packaging legislation or not. In fact, he said on the Today show, 'I haven't seen the legislation. Show us the legislation. When I see the legislation I will make up my mind.' It made me wonder, when Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has been so determined on many other issues. Did he wait to see the legislation when it came to climate change action? Did he wait to see the legislation on private health insurance reforms? Did he wait to see the legislation on mining tax? The truth is: the Leader of the Opposition could make up his mind right now, right here, if he was not so close to big tobacco that it was blurring his judgment.                 It is time for Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, to explain what his position is on plain tobacco packaging. I think the Leader of the Opposition also should give the public another explanation as well, because he has been out in the media protesting that no-one has been tougher than him when it comes to introducing health warnings -                      It does directly relate to plain packaging, because one of the key purposes of plain packaging is to ensure that health warnings are the first and only thing that the public see when they buy a packet of cigarettes. The Leader of the Opposition has been out in the media saying that no-one was tougher than him in introducing graphic warnings on tobacco. But the Sydney Morning Herald published another story. It reported that when Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, was the health minister, he challenged whether these steps needed to be taken. I quote:                 'Do we really have to be doing this?' he asked. He argued that smoking was a matter of 'personal responsibility' and people had 'freedom to choose.'                 It is no wonder that those opposite are starting to divide on this issue. It is no wonder that people are questioning whether he is a tobacco denier as well as a climate change denier. Australia could lead the world on tobacco control, but the Leader of the Opposition needs to lead his party.

  I thank the member for Indi for her question. First, I would say to the member for Indi that I understand that families right around the nation struggle with cost-of-living pressures. That is why, for those families, who also care about the future of this country and also believe that climate change is real, I am determined that we get big polluters to pay the price of carbon pollution and we use that revenue to assist Australian families, to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs to tackle climate change and take us to our clean energy future.                 The member for Indi does not believe climate change is real but what she does believe in, presumably, is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip money off those families struggling with cost-of-living pressures and to use it to subsidise big polluters. I suggest that the member for Indi actually go to people in her electorate and say, 'Would it be all right by you if you paid more tax and that money went to subsidising big companies that pollute?' - because that is what the member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition stand for.                     Rather than trying to distort facts, as we have seen the opposition do as recently as this morning, rather than trying to generate fear, which we see the Leader of the Opposition do every day, rather than be lost in a world of climate change denial and rather than have the kinds of divisions we have seen in the Liberal Party, where the member for Wentworth says about the Leader of the Opposition's plan, 'It won't work and it will cost taxpayers,' we on this side of the House will get on with the job of tackling climate change through the cheapest way available, which is by putting a price on carbon and having it paid by the big polluters, whilst we assist Australian families, protect jobs and fund our transition to a clean energy future. That is the best thing that we can do to assist families as our nation makes this transition.                 Having met with some young Australians today, representative of so many other young Australians around the nation, and having met with women today who are taking personal action on climate change, it is clear that the Australian community overwhelmingly believes climate change is real and they want us to provide the leadership we are providing as to how to tackle climate change. They do not want to hear continuing negativity and fear campaigns from the Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question, because bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 is critical. You cannot actually return a budget to surplus unless you put in place savings measures, which of course is what the government did in our last budget. In this year's budget we have restricted real spending growth to one per cent a year. That stands in very stark contrast to 3.7 per cent per year in the last five years of the coalition government. We have put in place savings measures totalling $22 billion. These savings are very important because they will fund vital initiatives such as our new initiatives in mental health but also more broadly in education and hospitals. And they deliver a net benefit to the budget bottom line of $5 billion.                     This will be a very important thing in the parliament because we will see five key savings measures in the parliament totalling $4 billion in savings. This will be a very big test for those opposite, because you cannot say that you believe in coming back to surplus if you do not support the savings.                 Of course, there has been a lot commentary from those opposite as to where they may or may not stand on this matter, but I think the final word from Senator Minchin is one that is quite disturbing. He made this point:                 Too many Parties ... err on the side of populism ... That is ultimately self-defeating because you end up standing for nothing...                 Those remarks are directed at the shadow Treasurer and, of course, at the shadow finance spokesman. They are now so negative that they are now opposing their own policies. They decided in their party room last week that they would not be supporting the alternative fuels measures, which were a product of the Howard government and go back as far as 2004. They have now become so negative that they are opposing even policies they supported over a long period of time. What this demonstrates is what the opposition leader said in the party room last week when he said that he will take opportunism any time - opportunism over good policy.                     I certainly will, Mr Speaker. On the weekend a coalition MP, who will remain nameless, made this comment in the newspaper. He said:                 We can't keep agreeing with government spending measures opposing savings and ... keep our financial credibility intact.                 He is dead right.

  We do value agriculture as an industry and we support it strongly on this side of the House. There is perhaps no industry which is going to be more affected by dangerous climate change than agriculture. So we know this is yet further evidence of how those on that side of the House simply do not get it when it comes to the science of climate change, but there are farmers out there who truly understand the importance of dealing effectively with dangerous climate change and of putting in place policies to deal with it for the long term so they can grow and prosper and benefit from the Asian century. I personally am very optimistic about the future of agriculture in this country. Just as I am optimistic about the future of coal and iron ore, I am very optimistic about the future of agriculture because as this region grows, as the middle classes grow in Asia, they will demand more of our goods, not just iron ore and coal but our agricultural products. This is yet another reason why we as a nation must deal with dangerous climate change - to support our farmers and to support their families.                 Of course, this question is yet another example of just how desperate they have become. They will exaggerate any fact. They will twist any figure in the absence of a detailed design. We will go about constructing our emissions trading scheme in a methodical way. The climate change minister is doing a fantastic job of that. We will go about doing that based on science and based on evidence. We will go about doing it based on modelling because we have got the interests of the country at heart, unlike those opposite, who have got no alternative policies. They came in here today to call for an election, but they do not have an alternative economic policy and they do not have an alternative agricultural policy. This just shows how barren and inept they are.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his reference to the Garnaut review, which Professor Garnaut gave me earlier today and about which he has been speaking at the National Press Club. I have the review in my hand. It is the product of seven months work and I think we should thank Professor Garnaut for it as an Australian parliament and as an Australian nation. I do not anticipate that everybody will agree with every view put forward by Professor Garnaut, but that should not stop us actually thanking him for his work and respecting him in his professionalism in doing it. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, given he has talked about the question of cost, yes, Professor Garnaut makes some observations about costs. There is one on page 77 of this report and it uses the terminology 'direct action', as the Leader of the Opposition would use to refer to his policy. I would refer to it as a policy in which polluters are subsidised. But Professor Garnaut says this:                 Using direct action measures to achieve similar amounts of emissions reduction would raise costs -                      The Leader of the Opposition may be interested in these words -                  much more than a carbon price but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce the costs in any of these ways.                     My point is basically this, that if you want to look at the Garnaut review then you should look at all of it.                     What he does say about the measures that are proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is that they would raise costs much more than a carbon price but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce the cost in any of these ways.                     The costs might be covered by budgetary expenditure but this affects who pays the cost, not whether the costs are there, and other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action. So what Professor Garnaut is putting there, and what is a clear contrast between the policy that the government stands for and the Leader of the Opposition's policy, is that we are putting a price on carbon that big polluters would pay.                     We have always been clear about that, that big polluters would pay the price and by paying that price they would have the incentives they need to act to reduce the carbon pollution that they emit. We have also been very clear with Australian families - and I said this when I first outlined the carbon pricing mechanism to the Australian community - that there will be price impacts that flow through to Australian households. That is why we will use the majority of the revenue raised from pricing carbon to assist Australian households with those impacts, to generously assist Australian families who need that assistance the most. And we will use the remainder of the revenue to protect Australian jobs and to fund programs which help our move to being a clean energy economy. As Professor Garnaut says, the Leader of the Opposition's plan is about putting costs directly onto the shoulders of Australian taxpayers - that is, onto the shoulders of Australian families without any compensation at all.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for her high quality advocacy in this parliament of the needs and interests of her constituents. The member has directed to me a question which raises two reform areas important to keeping our economy strong. We want Australians to have the benefits of a strong economy and we particularly want Australians to have the benefit of being able to get a job. That is why we are proud that 750,000 jobs have been created since the government was first elected, and we look forward to the creation of half a million more over the next couple of years.                  Keeping your economy strong always requires you to have a continuing reform agenda, to keep walking the reform road. We are engaged in reforms which are important to keeping our economy strong. Putting a price on carbon is important to keeping our economy strong and ensuring that we have the clean energy jobs of the future. Last week I received the report of the Climate Commission entitled The critical decade. It said unambiguously that the science was in. Today I received the report of Professor Garnaut, and he says in his report unambiguously that pricing carbon is an economic reform where the benefits far outweigh the costs. He tells us a fixed price followed by a carbon trading scheme is the best path forward to reduce the dangers of climate change without damaging the prosperity of the Australian nation. He talks about how pricing carbon is the lowest cost way of tackling climate change and dealing with carbon pollution. I know that those opposite dispute the science and do not believe in climate change, and I know they refuse to look in a serious way at the works of serious economists like Professor Garnaut, but that is what Professor Garnaut has found.                 Continuing to keep our economy strong also means we need to have access to the infrastructure that our competitor nations will have, and that is national broadband that enables us to move information at the same speed that people are moving it in the economies with which we compete. The construction of the NBN is only the first step in that reform journey to make sure that we have the productivity benefits that come with this new technology. That is why, today, the government released the digital economy plan. It is a roadmap of how we will build the digital economy and a key part of that is how we will aim to be one of the top five OECD nations for the use and take-up of broadband by 2020. It contains important measures so that we can support small businesses and not-for-profit organisations in the first 40 communities to fully utilise the opportunities that the NBN brings, and we will also be investing in education to make sure that students, whether they be in schools or TAFEs or universities, have the full benefit of the National Broadband Network. In all of these reforms, whether it is climate change or the NBN, we will focus on the facts - we will not allow ourselves to be distracted by the diversions - and we will always act in the national interest.

  I think that Mr Garnaut has produced an excellent report. It is the policy of those on this side of the House that the biggest polluters will pay the price on carbon. We will use every cent from that price paid to assist households and to assist industry. There could not be a clearer contrast with the other side. The other side want to tax households to pay big polluters. That is the policy on that side of the House. And the authority for that is not Professor Garnaut; it is the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth, in his interview last week, made the point that a direct action policy such as they have is the policy that you have when you are not serious about dealing with climate change.                     The government has a policy of a market based mechanism. It is the most efficient mechanism; it is the least cost mechanism. Those on the other side of the House -                      I know why they are so embarrassed. It is because the shadow Treasurer used to have a policy for a market based mechanism as well. He used to support the member for Wentworth on a market based mechanism. We know when he changed his mind, because he went on Twitter and asked everybody to tell him what his convictions were.                 We on this side of the House support a market based mechanism that will price carbon for the 1,000 largest polluters and use the revenue to assist households. What they want to do is to increase the tax on average taxpayers and give the money to the biggest polluters. We have not seen a serious policy from those on that side of the House in 3Â½ years.                     The shadow Treasurer last year was found to have the biggest costing bungle seen in political history. He now expects to be taken seriously in this House.                     Those on that side of the House are so bereft of policy that there is nothing left for them to do but to run baseless scare campaigns. That is what they are doing with question after question.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. As the House has heard, Professor Garnaut today released the final update of his study into climate change and how the country should best respond to this important challenge. Professor Garnaut's update makes it absolutely clear that climate change is occurring, that it is caused by human activity and that it poses a serious risk to the prosperity and quality of life of all Australians.                 For the benefit of the member for Tangney, Professor Garnaut states the following in his report:                 Since 2008, advances in climate change science have ... broadly confirmed that the earth is warming, that human activity is the cause of it and that the changes in the physical world are likely, if anything, to be more harmful than the earlier science had suggested.                 That shows the quality of the contribution made last week by the member for Tangney in suggesting that there had been no warming in the last decade, despite the empirical evidence being emphatic that it was the warmest decade on record. That is testament to the control of those opposite by the climate science deniers. We know the influence that Senator Minchin has over the Leader of the Opposition in this regard.                 The views that Professor Garnaut has expressed on the climate science are based on expert advice. That advice is consistent with the advice received by the government from sources including the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Climate Commission and the Australian Academy of Science. Any government taking its public policy responsibility seriously to act in the national interest must respond to this challenge.                 It will also come as no surprise to the House, to economists generally and to anyone wanting to act on climate change that Professor Garnaut's proposed solution to this challenge is a carbon price delivered through a market mechanism. In his words in the report, he said 'market-based approaches to mitigation can bring out the best in Australians, and a return to regulatory approaches the worst'. Furthermore, Professor Garnaut had the following to say about the coalition's subsidies-for-polluters policy in his speech to the National Press Club today. He said 'Direct action for reducing carbon emissions is likely to be immensely more expensive than a market approach.'  He in fact went on to make the obvious observation about a subsidies policy: that it is in the worst traditions of old protectionism, subsidies and antimarket philosophy. That is exactly where the Leader of the Opposition sits: subsidies for the big polluters and no revenue to assist households with the slug on taxes that they will be hit with.                 This is not a view that is shared by all of those who are associated with the Liberal Party. We know the views of the member for Wentworth and many others on the other side of the House. But we know, too, that former Prime Minister John Howard understands and respects the science and understands and respects the need for a market mechanism, having taken an emissions trading scheme to the election in 2007. We heard from Dr John Hewson yesterday that a market mechanism is the best position. We heard Malcolm Fraser supporting a market mechanism to tackle this problem. Holding a public political leadership position, you are irresponsible on this issue. It is time that the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition took this issue seriously and made a serious contribution to and an effort in this debate.

  I have the page of the Garnaut report that the Leader of the Opposition refers to. It will not surprise anyone in this parliament to know that he is misrepresenting the force of Professor Garnaut's words. When you read these words, try to understand them, digest them and think about them in the national interest rather than try to clip a few out to use for a petty political agenda. What you actually find when you read Professor Garnaut's words is this, and very clearly: Professor Garnaut is there contrasting and comparing the costs for Australian households of two ways of pricing carbon - the way that the government is talking about by putting a price on carbon which businesses pay or the way that the Leader of the Opposition is talking about through regulatory mechanisms. He is comparing and contrasting those two approaches. The Leader of the Opposition cannot rely on one sentence in this document and not use the force of every other sentence. Professor Garnaut very, very clearly concludes that the mechanism the Leader of the Opposition is advocating is more costly for Australian households. Let me read the quote:                 Using direct action measures to achieve a similar amount of emissions reduction would raise costs much more than carbon pricing _                     I refer to the section of the report that the Leader of the Opposition referred to to ensure that, rather than having it misrepresented in this place, people understand what Professor Garnaut is putting here. He puts very clearly - these are his exact words:                 Using direct action measures to achieve a similar amount of emissions reduction would raise costs much more than carbon pricing, but would not raise the revenue to offset or reduce the costs in any of these ways. The costs might be covered by budgetary expenditure, but this affects who pays the costs, not whether the costs are there. Other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action.                 Who are those 'other people' whose taxes have to rise? They are probably better known to the Australian community as mums and dads with jobs who would need to pay the increased taxes that the Leader of the Opposition would need in order to subsidise big polluters.                 What we have said consistently, and Professor Garnaut makes this point too, is you put a price on carbon pollution. Big polluters pay that price. We have always been very clear indeed that there would be some price impacts, which is why we take revenue from pricing carbon and we generously assist households who need it the most. I have said that many times before. The Leader of the Opposition may only just have heard it: we generously assist households who will need that assistance the most. The difference here is more tax for Australian families and no assistance compared to a price on the biggest polluters and using that money to assist households. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition, instead of looking at the occasional word in Professor Garnaut's report, reads the whole lot.                 This price wouldn't be paid by households, it would be paid by the 1000 biggest businesses -

  I thank the member for Kennedy for the question in my capacity here representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I appreciate the perspective and the concerns of the electorate of Kennedy when anything relates to the live export industry. I have been with the member for Kennedy to Normanton and Cloncurry and met with some of the graziers and pastoralists there. It is a similar story across much of the north of Australia, going across through the Northern Territory and into Western Australia. There are a large number of jobs, family businesses and Indigenous employment operations which are underpinned by very large pastoralist industries.                 It is also true that the reason that this debate has taken off in such a way over the last 24 hours is that the footage that was on television last night was just awful. I felt that watching it, I am sure every Australian felt that and I am sure every farmer felt that as well. I note the comments that have been made by the New South Wales Farmers Association already about the distress that many of their members have felt in seeing their own stock treated in the way that we saw last night at a number of establishments. The footage was only made available to the minister for agriculture shortly before that program went to air. In that time, a number of actions have been taken and shortly before we went to question time the minister for agriculture provided a detailed media conference where he went through the gravity of what had been sighted and also the specific actions which he had already undertaken and further actions which he has left the way open for.                 Suffice to say of those specific establishments that have been involved and have been seen in that footage that Australian farmers do expect that their stock will be treated better than that. The Australian people expect that animals originating from Australia will be treated better than that, and the actions taken thus far by the minister have centred on those specific establishments.

  What we have is yet another example of just how shallow the shadow Treasurer is. By the day he gets more hollow. We have been very clear about what we are doing in pricing carbon. Of course the price is paid by the 1,000 largest producers and of course there will be price impacts. That is why we have said every single cent will go to households and will go to industries and will go to programs to drive renewable energy. Every single cent will go in that direction. But there is no credibility left on that side of the House, not when it comes to the shadow Treasurer and not when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition.                 The shadow Treasurer was once a believer in a price on carbon, but his situation has got so bad he now has to write performance appraisals for the Financial Review saying how good he is, because he has become a hollow man. There is no alternative policy on that side of the House.                     What they do have is a policy they call direct action. That policy taxes consumers, taxes households and gives the benefits to the biggest polluters. That is what it does and that is what they are so embarrassed about.

  I want to thank the member for Page for the question and acknowledge in similar terms to the job opportunities that I referred to across the north of Australia that there are many members on this side of the chamber, and some over there as well, with very significant meatworks within their electorates. They are very conscious of wanting to make sure that we maximise opportunities for the downstream processing jobs in Australia, as well as the animal welfare concerns which were aired last night. The member for Page has been pursuing these issues very strongly for quite some time. As I said a moment ago, anyone who saw that footage last night would have been horrified. The footage was just awful, and Australian farmers have been quite distressed by it as well. Shortly before question time, Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, put forward an initial response on behalf of the government. As I say, he was presented with this footage shortly before the program went to air but shortly before question time was able to go through the responses which the Australian people would expect we would have to what was presented overnight. Our response is to: first of all, ask the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to conduct an immediate investigation into the specifics of the footage; next, to announce that the government will appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the complete supply chain for live exports up to and including the point of slaughter; and next, to ask for the minister himself to receive a briefing on the full range of legislative and regulatory options which are available to respond to issues concerned with animal welfare.                 In the interim, Minister Ludwig has asked for orders to enforce the suspension of live animal exports to the facilities which were identified by the evidence which was broadcast last night. The minister will also add further facilities to the banned list in the future if required. He has implemented a moratorium on the installation of the restraint boxes that were seen being used in the footage. This will apply to the instalment of any new boxes with Commonwealth funds across all global markets. He has also asked the Chief Veterinary Officer, the chief vet, to coordinate an independent scientific assessment of the restraint boxes which are under use in Indonesia.                 Following the completion of this work, the government will consider what further actions may be necessary. The government does share the legitimate concerns of the Australian community about animal welfare abuses and is taking the necessary action to investigate the footage. I thank the member for Page for raising the issue.

  It sounds like the member for Curtin wants to make a comeback as the shadow Treasurer! As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency have indicated, we think this is a very good report from Professor Garnaut. It is a very important report that means that there can be a thorough community debate about dealing with dangerous climate change and its impact not just on our environment but on our economy. Of course, it is a serious piece of work. It is a serious piece of work which feeds into the work that the government is doing with the multi-party committee, the business community and the wider community. We will take that on board as we go through developing an emissions trading scheme based on the principles that have already been announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.                 What we have seen here today is the pretence that somehow the government have already taken those decisions. We have not. The opposition want to go out there and run a scare campaign. Why are they running a scare campaign? It is because they are so acutely embarrassed about their lack of policy. They have no economic policy. They have been coming into this House and calling for an election despite the fact that their election policy from last year had a $10 billion hole in it.                     We on this side of the House take our responsibilities very seriously, unlike those opposite. We are going about in a methodical way producing a policy which deals with dangerous climate change and protects our economy for the future, unlike those opposite, who simply want to tax Australian families and hand the money to large polluters. We have a serious policy process in train for the benefit of the country and we are proud of what we are doing, unlike those opposite, who can only run a cheap scare campaign.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. People might have heard the member for Greenway this morning talking about her earlier habit, as a young woman, of smoking and choosing the packet that was the most glamorous and the fact that she has been able to quit that habit and now is supporting the introduction of plain packaging - a world first. On World No Tobacco Day, it is an appropriate time to congratulate all those campaigners who for years and years have been calling on governments to take this action, and I am very proud to be part of a government that is taking this action.                  I want to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition. I know he does not normally like listening to me here at the dispatch box but this might be an occasion when he does. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for finally declaring that he is going to do the right thing and that the Liberal Party will support this measure when it comes into the parliament. More importantly, I want to congratulate the member for Moore, the member for Hasluck and the member for Fairfax. There were many members on the Liberal Party backbench who finally brought the Leader of the Opposition to this position. It was against his instincts; his instincts were to say no. He did not want to do it, but he has been forced to do it by the weight of evidence that this is the right thing to do. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has decided to support this measure, and I want to congratulate him for that. I do think, however, that on World No Tobacco Day there is a remaining habit that he needs to kick and that is a habit that goes to the receipt of tobacco donations. I report to the House that the AMA last week -                      I report to the House that on Friday last week the AMA presented its tobacco awards and I am pleased that our government was the recipient of one of those awards. But another government was also a recipient. We shared the AMA award for tackling tobacco with a state government.  I want to give you this quote:                 _ I do not support receiving donations from tobacco companies. That is the position we had at the last state election; it is the position we will maintain.                  These comments from the Western Australian Liberal Premier, Colin Barnett, earned him an award from the AMA for resisting the influences of big tobacco companies who are donating large amounts to the Liberal-National Party. Far from being embarrassed about this, the Leader of the Opposition went on television last week and said that not only were people welcome to donate to the Liberal Party but he would invite them to donate more. It seems that British American Tobacco giving 97 per cent of their donations to the Liberal Party is not enough; they want 100 per cent of the donations from British American Tobacco.                  Obviously, we are delighted that the Liberal Party has seen what is the right thing to do. We want to congratulate the opposition for coming to its senses and I would like to nominate British American Tobacco for a Guinness Book of Records award for an own goal. The only reason we have been talking so much about this for the last two weeks is that Mr Crow went out and gave an extraordinary press conference which ultimately led to the Leader of the Opposition being so embarrassed that he had to change his position.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. What she has said is entirely baseless because we have not completed the design of the scheme. It is a continuation of the scare campaign that we are seeing from those opposite. They have been fond of quoting Professor Garnaut, so I would like to quote from page 77 of his report where he talks about the opposition's so-called direct action options. He says:                 Other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action.                  In the long-run, households will pay almost the entire carbon price as businesses pass carbon cost through to the users of their products.                   That is Mr Garnaut's view of their so-called -

  I thank the member for Blair for this very important question. Today's balance of payments figures do show the very dramatic impact on both the economy and our exports of recent natural disasters, particularly in Queensland. It is appropriate that that question is asked by the member for Blair, and there are plenty of members on this side of the House whose communities were dramatically impacted - not just the economic impact but the social impact. And there are many on the other side of the House who also felt the full brunt of not just the floods in Queensland but also the impact of Cyclone Yasi in Far North Queensland, the rains in Western Australia - in the north-west - and the bushfires in Victoria. This was a traumatic time and a dramatic time in our economy.                  The March quarter balance of payments show a sharp fall in export volumes in the first three months of this year. Export volumes fell by 8.7 per cent in the March quarter. This is the biggest quarterly fall in export volumes in 37 years. This contributed to a widening in the current account deficit of $2.3 billion to $10.4 billion, representing three per cent of the December quarter GDP. It is no surprise after those disasters that the biggest factor behind today's results was a very significant reduction in coal exports. Coal export volumes fell by $4.6 billion in the March quarter, which were down 26.8 per cent on the previous quarter. A large part of this lost coal production did occur in Queensland, with the Minerals Council estimating that 85 per cent of Queensland's coalmines suffered production losses in the quarter, mainly due to flooding. But of course there were also significant disruptions particularly to rail. And, as I said before, we had cyclones and heavy rainfall in north-western Australia earlier this year. Iron ore export volumes were down $1.3 billion or 7.7 per cent less than the previous quarter. So, of course, the impact of the summer floods and the cyclones and the events in Western Australia will take a heavy toll on GDP growth in the March quarter. Overall, net exports are expected to subtract around 2.4 percentage points from growth in the quarter. This is estimated to be the largest quarterly subtraction from GDP growth since records began in 1959. So there has been a dramatic impact on our economy from these natural disasters, and it is somewhat larger than the Treasury initially estimated.                  But whatever the outcome for the national accounts, the one thing we are absolutely certain of is that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. We still have low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent - lower than just about every other advanced economy. There is strong job creation, with over 700,000 jobs having been created since we came to office. And, of course, there is a record terms of trade and an unprecedented pipeline of investment. That is why it is important to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is why it is important to invest in our workforce, to build a bigger and better trained workforce. This government is absolutely determined to get the fundamentals right for our economy so that we can turn our success into a stronger economy for all Australians.

  I do genuinely thank the shadow minister for the opportunity to answer a further question about the Garnaut review, because I think it is very important for anyone who is watching question time today to not fall for the false premises that are behind the opposition's question. The opposition is mounting its question time - I certainly would not use the word 'attack'; I would not use the word 'strategy'; I must admit the word really escapes me. Anyway, whatever this kind of shambolic display is, No. 1, the opposition is trying to say that Professor Garnaut's review is the government's policy. It says that if the government does not agree with that proposition, somehow the government is walking away from Professor Garnaut. Of course, all of this analysis is a false premise and absolutely absurd. So let us be clear about Professor Garnaut's work. Yes, Professor Garnaut was asked to update his earlier report. We are a government that thinks public policy is best informed when you invite experts to participate and to put forward their views. Professor Garnaut has put forward his views and I thank him very much for doing that. But of course the government will make the decisions about the final design of carbon pricing and we will work through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and our usual cabinet processes to do that. Clearly, I understand that those opposite do not like proper public policy processes.                     I was asked about a matter dealt with in Professor Garnaut's report, and I am clarifying and dealing with that. I am definitely going to clarify this point because of the game playing we are seeing from the opposition today. Of course, they do not want Australians to have a rational debate about climate change and carbon pricing because in the face of a rational debate their fear campaign runs off the rails. Professor Garnaut has put his views into the public domain and they actually deserve a considered public policy response from those opposite. Of course, they will never get that because those opposite are climate change deniers and they are determined to run a fear campaign. What we will do with Professor Garnaut's work - of course, it is there to inform the public discussion - is consider it deeply and the government will make decisions at the appropriate time and we will outline all of those decisions to the Australian people.                  Coming to the question that I was asked, can I say this about the cost of living and Australian households: the Leader of the Opposition has distorted today words from a chapter of Professor Garnaut's work that is called 'Better climate, better tax'. That is, Professor Garnaut is talking about tax cuts. What I can certainly say to the House today is as we work through designing household assistance and carbon pricing, tax cuts are a serious option. To the Leader of the Opposition, I would say: what that means is that he has decided to go to the next election ripping assistance out of people's hands and taking money away from Australian families. Of course, we understand the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families and we will make the appropriate decisions to generously assist Australian families.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question, a very good question on World No Tobacco Day. It is a good question, because I would like to tell the House that Customs, through its own very strong regime, has been detecting illegal tobacco in this country for some time and has been prosecuting those involved in that very illicit trade. The government is committed to combating illegal tobacco smuggling in this country. We work very closely with law enforcement agencies, with the states and, beyond our shores, with intelligence agencies to ensure we detect these transnational crimes.                 A strong indication of the success since 2007 is that potential revenue losses of customs duty of more than $400 million have been prevented because of the detection and confiscation of illegal tobacco items. Last year alone, Customs was involved in 10 separate tobacco-smuggling cases, successfully prosecuting those cases, which involved 35 convictions, eight custodial sentences, and very hefty penalties and fines for those who were involved in that behaviour.                 I raise those issues because the tobacco industry - for their own vested interests, I purport - have indicated that the problem is larger than it really is. Indeed, the tobacco industry have indicated that one in every six smokers in this country consumes illegal tobacco. That is an exaggerated claim. Those claims are based on reports that have been paid for by the tobacco industry themselves. So not only do they fund the Liberal Party but also they fund self-serving research to undermine the facts and to substantiate bogus claims that are being made to scare the public. They are wrong. According to the 2007 National Drug Strategy household survey, 0.2 per cent have consumed illegal tobacco for most of the time that they smoke. That is 0.2 per cent.                  The tobacco industry also asserts that plain packaging will lead to a huge increase in criminal offences. That of course is not true. That is baseless. The facts are that the illegal tobacco smugglers have had ready access to software technology to replicate specific brand packaging for some years. Indeed, they have very sophisticated counterfeit items. So any transition from specific brand packaging to plain packaging will not in any way, other than perhaps a negligible way, have an effect upon crime in this area. That is very important to note given the scare campaign that has been running.                 We know plain packaging will remove the allure, the romance or the glamour that some people see in smoking. It will reduce the likelihood of people, young people in particular, becoming addicts of this particular drug. The Minister for Health and Ageing has applauded the efforts of the opposition - and I do so too - in coming to the party, even if it is the case that the Leader of the Opposition came to the party kicking and screaming. I would like to commend the health minister for her good work and commend the member for Moore, the member for Hasluck, those on the other side who knew that this was good public policy and supported it not because of their political interests but because it was good public policy. This government will continue to do that. As we continue to do that, Tony Abbott will remain the Dr No of Australian politics.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I am very happy to name people who are in support of pricing carbon.                     For example, there is former Prime Minister Howard. For example, there is former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. For example, there is former Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull. For example, there is former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson. For example, there is Andrew Peacock, who took a cut in emissions to an election. And the list goes on and on. As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition -                      My understanding is that the Leader of the Opposition is the only living national Liberal leader in this country who is opposed to a price on carbon.                     The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjected 'pathetic' before -                      and, yes, it is. The Leader of the Opposition has allowed his political negativity to mean that he has turned his back on the Liberal tradition of -                      successful prime ministers like John Howard. They have walked away from that tradition because they are preferring the path of negativity to putting an idea in the nation's interest.                     And then, of course, I was asked about who I can name who supports carbon pricing. Let me actually go -                      I move:                 That the member for Paterson be suspended from the service of the House.                 Question put.

  I am simply stunned by that question from the shadow Treasurer. He refers to the contraction in the March quarter as a 'mining boom cough', when in fact we have had a contraction in the March quarter of 1.7 percentage points because of the impact of the biggest natural disaster in Australia's history. They do not accept that on that side of the House. I am completely stunned as to how out of touch they have become. There was a contraction in the March quarter of 1.2 per cent, but minus 1.7 per cent came from the natural disasters - from the floods in Queensland, from Cyclone Yasi, from the floods in northern New South Wales, from the floods in the north-west of Western Australia. And they come into this House and describe that as a mining boom cough. This is just extraordinary.                 I think I can understand why they are so out of touch. We had a clue to this a few weeks ago. The Leader of the Opposition came into this House and gave a speech for 30 minutes and did not once mention the impact of the floods, Cyclone Yasi or the weather events in the north-west of Western Australia - not once in a 30-minute speech. Then we had the shadow Treasurer go to the Press Club, supposedly to deliver some alternative to the budget, and not once, in a 30-minute speech, did he mention the impact of the floods, Cyclone Yasi and other weather events. This just shows how out of touch, how incompetent, they are and how they do not understand the challenges facing the Australian economy.                 The fact is that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. If you have a look at the figures today, you will see that consumption, dwelling investment and business investment are all making positive contributions to growth, but the big negative in the figures today is the impact of those cyclones and those floods. Those opposite want to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that they never happened. This is incredible.                 I do not think there has been an opposition this incompetent, this out of touch, in the history of this country. They want to ignore too the very strong pipeline of business investment that we have. They want to ignore the fact that, if we are going to cope with that in the years ahead, we have got to bring our budget back to surplus. But they are intent on wrecking that surplus. They come into the House and complain about deficits. They have never seen a deficit that they did not want to make bigger, as they come into this House and oppose saves. They are opposing vital savings measures in this House. They are trying to wreck the government surplus. It has got so bad, and they have got so negative, that they are now opposing their own policies. Can you believe that? They are opposing a policy of the Howard government that goes back to 2004 because they are so negative.                     They pretend that the global financial crisis is a hiccup and that the natural disasters, the floods and cyclones, did not happen. That is how incompetent they are, how negative they have become and how unqualified they are for high office.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As a Queensland representative in this parliament, she knows what it was like for the people of Queensland to live through the summer that they lived through. We know that the natural disasters that hit our nation were not just confined to Queensland, though Queensland was so badly affected. We were not the only nation on earth to suffer at that time. We remember what happened in Christchurch and, of course, we all remember the scale of the tragedy that hit Japan. All of these things had a pressing, tragic impact for individuals and their families and many people are still recovering, and they have also had an economic impact. When we look at today's national account figures, we see that economic impact very clearly. Our economy is set to grow by four per cent in 2011-12. The fundamentals of our economy are strong. We will create half a million new jobs by 2013. Our unemployment rate is set to fall to 4Â½ per cent. Of course, this comes on top of the creation of 750,000 jobs since 2007 when many economies around the world have been literally seeing millions of jobs lost.                 Today's national account numbers do show a contraction due to the impact of the natural disasters that we have seen. The floods and the cyclones alone are estimated to have reduced growth by 1.7 percentage points over the March quarter. That is because those events had an impact on commodity exports - $5.3 billion dollars was wiped out from coal and iron ore. That is to do with flooding of mines and, obviously, flooding of supply routes. And there were other sections of the economy that were hit. But we should not lose sight of the strong performance in the rest of our economy that we see in today's figures. Consumption, dwelling investment and business investment all made positive contributions to growth in the early part of this year, and that is welcome indeed. Over 50,000 jobs were created in the March quarter and they are part of hundreds of thousands of more jobs to be created in the next few years. The terms of trade are at their highest levels in 140 years.                 We are already seeing the economy coming back strongly as we recover from the floods. Mines that were flooded only a few months ago have now resumed production and that will drive a rebound in export earnings. Coal exports jumped 14 per cent in March after falling almost 30 per cent in February, so that shows you how quickly some mines were able to bring their economic production back on stream. And there is a massive pipeline of investment with the Bureau of Resource Economics estimating $430 billion planned for resource projects to come.                 We have to keep rebuilding the Queensland economy. The government put in place a responsible package to fund the flood recovery. Unfortunately, those opposite when they tried to pass that test were unable to put a funding package together. The only funding package that the parliament has ever seen that has added up and worked is the one brought to it by the government. That funding package has enabled us to contribute a billion dollars already to support rebuilding efforts and a further billion dollars will be advanced by the end of the month, and $411 million has already been distributed to 53 local councils to help them get on with the job of rebuilding. There is much more to do but we are rebuilding and we will see, as a result, a rebound from the figures announced today through the national accounts.

  As my colleagues have observed, the Leader of the Opposition has already grown bored with discussion of the economy and he is back to the only thing he knows how to do, which is to distort things in pursuit of a fear campaign. What he is doing today is distorting the words of Professor Ross Garnaut in an incredibly irresponsible way. To anybody who has listened to the Leader of the Opposition's question let me say this to them very clearly. The Leader of the Opposition has misrepresented Professor Garnaut. We always see the Leader of the Opposition do this because he cannot mount an argument that deals with the facts. It is impossible. He knows he cannot mount an argument that deals with the facts. He can never discuss the facts. He never wants to hear the facts because as soon as the facts are on the table his fear campaign falls away. So at every opportunity, including every opportunity in this parliament, he walks in with distortions.                  Professor Garnaut did not say what the Leader of the Opposition put into his question. That did not happen. What Professor Garnaut talked about was the kind of climate commission they have in the United Kingdom where a body makes recommendations to government, which then performs its democratic role in the way that governments do. Of course, our democracy is filled with bodies that make recommendations to government. The Productivity Commission is just one such body that makes recommendations to government. If we look at the way that works in our democracy, it has worked for years without anybody taking the kind of silly political point we are seeing the Leader of the Opposition take today. I have never heard the Leader of the Opposition walk up to the dispatch box or indeed any other microphone and say that his Conservative counterpart David Cameron is not exercising an appropriate democratic -                      I had a distortion of Professor Garnaut's words put to me. I am correcting that distortion. No-one should believe it to be true. It is not true. I am pointing out the truth of what Professor Garnaut said. You can see examples of the kind of arrangement that he is thinking about around the world, including in the United Kingdom, where Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron very recently received recommendations from a climate commission and determined to act on those recommendations. I did not hear the Leader of the Opposition say at that time that he thought his Conservative counterpart was not behaving appropriately as Prime Minister, so let us not listen to any of this nonsense.                 I think the Australian people will increasingly be asking themselves: why is it that the Leader of the Opposition can never engage in the climate change debate by dealing with the facts? Why is it that he always has to rely on falsehoods and fear? You rely on falsehoods and fear when you do not have a rational argument, and that is the Leader of the Opposition's problem. He has no rational argument, no rational policy, no rational belief in the science; all he is peddling is fear and falsehood, and every Australian should understand that.

  I thank the member for Dobell for that very important question, because it is important to bring the budget back to surplus. Our economy has taken a significant short-term hit from natural disasters, but it has not been knocked off its long-term path. We have falling unemployment. Unemployment is at 4.9 per cent. We have the prospect of something like 500,000 additional jobs in Australia. We have record terms of trade, and we have an unprecedented investment pipeline. Investment is at something like 50-year highs. And, of course, we have the forecast from ABARES of an investment pipeline of something like $430 billion. It is absolutely vital that we ensure that we do not compound the price pressures which will flow from that investment pipeline.                 That is why it is so important to constrain spending and to put in place savings. That is why we have spending growth of only one per cent over the forward estimates on average. Those opposite, when they were last in power, had spending growth in real terms of 3.7 per cent and made the mistake of going on a spending spree at the height of mining boom mark 1. In this budget, importantly, we have put in place $22 billion worth of savings - important savings to make sure that we do not compound those price pressures. Of course, that is why we have to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13.                 If you are serious about economic policy you accept the economics of that. From time to time there have been some on the other side of the House who have been serious about economic policy, including Senator Minchin, who of course is the mentor of the Leader of the Opposition. This is what he said about the importance of savings, following the debacle in the party room last week:                 When we take decisions to cut revenue and government we have to find ways to replace revenue.                 That is a perfectly reasonable point. But of course it is not one that is going to be followed by those opposite, who are intent on wrecking the surplus and have now announced that they are going to go out and oppose a Howard government initiative of over five years ago. This 'just say no' strategy is not an alternative to putting forward an economic policy, of which they have none. They are so incompetent. They have no economic policy, no alternative framework and no embarrassment or shame at their political opportunism. They cannot come into this chamber and support important reforms. There is no alternative. What they prove is that they are completely incompetent when it comes to national economic policy.

  I say to the member for Paterson's that once again if you deal with the facts and do not peddle falsehoods then things become clear. Let me just go through the facts.                     I say to the member for Paterson that I assume he probably does want to tell his constituents the truth. Let us go through each assertion he has put and actually get to the truth.                     Number one: on the question of energy generation and the impact of carbon pricing, let me refer him to a report released last month by the Minister for Resources and Energy. It is a report by Deloittes and I think he would find it interesting reading. The report's modelling shows that delaying the introduction of a carbon price will cost Australian electricity users between $1 billion and $2 billion annually, rising to as much as $5 billion a year by 2025. That report is telling you that uncertainty about carbon pricing is causing difficulties with investment in energy generation, and we need to end that uncertainty. As the member knows, being a member in New South Wales, his constituents have seen increases in electricity prices.                     They have seen increases in electricity prices and that of course is not about a carbon price. There is no carbon price in operation now, so he cannot possibly be saying to his constituents that the current increases in their electricity bills relate to that. As he well knows, the current increases in their electricity bills relate to underinvestment in distribution networks. That underinvestment needs to be made up for. That is putting price pressure on electricity now and the last thing we should do is add to the uncertainty and add to underinvestment with all of the problems that that would spell for long-term power pricing, as outlined by Deloittes.                 Let me go to the member for Paterson's claim about 13,000 job losses and let us try looking at the truth about that. He is referring to a study by Frontier Economics, which is from a few years ago and relates to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What he should perhaps tell his constituents is that the Frontier modelling is showing that employment would still grow in the Hunter. That is the truth. More jobs in the Hunter. Then, he may want to tell his constituents the truth about the investments that this government is making in the Hunter to enable it to transition to a clean-energy future. For example, Newcastle is home to the Australian Solar Institute - a $150 million commitment as part of our clean energy initiatives. Is the member opposed to investment in solar energy and the Hunter?                     No he is not, he says. Then, that is co-located with the CSIRO Energy Centre in Newcastle. Is he opposed to that clean energy future?                     No, he is not. Then we committed $30 million to the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources. Is he opposed to that?                     He is not sure about that one. And it stands alongside our $100 million Smart Grid, Smart City investment. Is he opposed to that?                     I thank the member for Paterson for his support for our clean energy investments in his area. They are showing how a clean energy future can be built.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I understand that he is genuinely and deeply concerned about the circumstance of his constituent and I think many members in the parliament have seen similar representations from their constituents. You always want to try to give a helping hand, so I understand his motivation in raising this question and I am very concerned to hear about the circumstances of his constituent Mrs Thurley.                 I assure the member for Denison that we continue to work through the processes that have guided Australian governments on pharmaceutical benefits listing. They are processes that have enabled us as a nation to afford medicines, to get them to people and to ensure that we share that burden equitably through our budgeting arrangements. Indeed, our PBS is very much envied by nations around the world. But in order for it to continue to work we need to go through stages of assessment.                 First and foremost we need to take the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. They are the experts who make recommendations, and we cannot as politicians substitute our sense of what should be listed for what is on the PBS. We do have to listen to the advice of the PBAC. We of course respond to that advice. We work through and deal with the financial issues. The government is well used to that, because Labor has added 500 new medicines or brands to the PBS since coming to government, costing around $4 billion over four years. We continue to work through them and have listed a considerable number of new medicines. For example, we very recently listed, as a supported vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine. That was important, and we funded the catch-up program.                 We will continue to do those assessments with advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. There are always decisions to work through. There are always questions of how to deal with the funding of medicines. We work through them and will continue to work through them. I understand that the member is concerned about his constituent and I am very happy to keep him informed on this particular medicine as the government works through its assessments.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. He is of course very proud of what this government has done, in particular for the Ipswich Motorway in Brisbane. We took the hard decision to invest in infrastructure during the global financial crisis, not only to stimulate the economy and to support jobs in the short term but to leave a lasting legacy in our communities, just like the government are doing right now through our flood and cyclone reconstruction package. Something like two-thirds of the roads that were damaged in Queensland have already been repaired and are open and running - a remarkable performance.                 Through the stimulus we funded a number of projects. On Saturday night I was at an important opening - the opening of the Gold Coast stadium. I attended the first home game of the Gold Coast Suns to open and kick off the new stadium. On the way there I passed the construction site for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit system, another of our important infrastructure investments and the first ever Commonwealth investment in a light rail project. Construction is underway and jobs are underway on the Gold Coast.                 Back in May 2009 we announced an allocation of $36 million for the stadium, the single largest allocation for a community infrastructure project. Just two years later it is built, opened on time and on budget. It was a sell-out game, with all 25,000 seats full. Seven thousand fans made the journey from interstate, particularly fans of Geelong. They got on planes, went to the Gold Coast and created jobs in tourism, jobs in the hotels, jobs in the restaurants and jobs at the venue - all tourism dollars going into the local economy.                     I am amazed that they seem to be opposed to job creation in our economy - but we know they are always opposed to everything. There were a few people there who were supportive on Saturday night. The Queensland Premier was there; the Gold Coast City Council mayor was there; even the local member was there - the member for Moncrieff - showing his support for the project. He did not bring his vuvuzela, so the crowd did not have that annoying noise. The member for Warringah has the opposition's vuvuzela, where he just says, 'no, no, no'. The fans were actually cheering on Saturday night, and so was the member for Moncrieff. Even though he voted against the stadium, he was there. Whether they vote against the stadium or they vote against the reconstruction that is taking place in Queensland, nothing can stop them turning up to a sod-turn or an opening - nothing whatsoever. They are always there for the ribbon cuttings; they are always there to claim credit. Yet when you raise it, when they have an opportunity to vote in this House, they are never there; they are always against it. But give him credit - at least he turned up to vote on the economic stimulus package, which is more than the Leader of the Opposition did because he missed six votes.                     He could not be bothered speaking on the legislation and missed six votes -                      It is more than the member for Wentworth has missed in his entire career!                      I do know indeed that it is relevant. It is relevant to know who has an interest in economics and job creation, because we know that the Leader of the Opposition has no interest in economics - just ask Peter Costello. We know his answer to everything is to oppose it - just ask Nick Minchin. We know he is a master of the negative - just ask John Hewson.                      All opposition and no leader.

  I thank the member for her question. She obviously has a deep desire to be the shadow Treasurer, but I am not sure that is going to happen any time soon.                      We have had a series of questions in this House which have sought to distort what Professor Garnaut has had to say and to distort what others have had to say.                     I make no apology for the fact that we are going to use the revenue raised from the 1,000 largest polluters in our economy to give back and assist households and other climate change programs, and I have said that consistently. I have said it in terms of industry, said it in terms of renewable energy, said it in terms of all our responsibilities. Yet again, this is simply part of the scare campaign that those opposite are running because they do not have any alternative policy framework whatsoever.                  We on this side of the House will concentrate on getting the fundamentals right in our economy and for the future. We will put our hand up to do the difficult things that are required in the economy to support jobs and to reduce carbon pollution. Those on that side of the House will just continue to be negative, with no alternative policy whatsoever. For them to come into this House and claim that they have got some knowledge or some expertise is simply incredible. They have come into the House and described the global financial crisis as a hiccup. They have come into this House and said there was another hiccup -                      I certainly will, because we on this side of the House will concentrate on getting the big economic calls right. That is what we will concentrate on. We will have no part of the negative strategy that those opposite are following. We will get the big calls right, as we did during the global financial crisis, as we did when the floods hit Queensland and as is required with reducing carbon pollution.

  I really want to thank the member for Kingston for that very important question, because it is true that we on this side believe that all of our homes, our communities and our workplaces should be safe places, where people feel respected. Our government is helping to build resilient, stable and safe communities by undertaking things like changing our workplace laws; getting rid of Work Choices; working with the not-for-profit sector on building a national compact; taking a place based approach to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom flow, even to our most disadvantaged communities and our most disadvantaged people; focusing on long-neglected issues like mental health and homelessness and closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage; and recognising that the success of government programs depends not just on what is delivered but on how we deliver those programs.                 The relationships that we have as a government with our community have to be respectful and they have to be adult. When conflicts arise, we need to deal with those matters as adults. We need to argue on the issues based on the facts that are available to us. That is why it was so very disappointing today to see the attack on the Minister for Finance and Deregulation by Senator Bushby. In fact, estimates is a terrific opportunity for -                      First of all, Senator Bushby's spokesperson said that Senator Wong was overly sensitive and using her gender to hide her overreaction to a simple request, but later, I acknowledge, the senator did tell news.com.au that he had not intended to attack Senator Wong because she was a woman. Senator Bushby said:                 Her reaction to the issue of the secretary's appearance was like that of an angry cat. It could have been a male or female cat. So I thought she was like an angry cat, the way they sometimes strike out. I like cats.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think everyone in this House agrees that there is room for humour in this House and in the other place. I think we all agree that there is room for rough and tumble. I think we all know that politics is a business where there is a degree of conflict. But what I am tired of - and what so many women are tired of - is that whenever there is conflict we have the Leader of the Opposition and his senior shadow ministers reverting to this sort of sexist language.                     I will wind up, because -                      No, I just want to finish this.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker, I am not in a position to withdraw the comments of other members of parliament and senators but I will say, as the Minister for Social Inclusion -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. As Minister for Social Inclusion I have seen this government promote respectful relationships campaigns between young Australian men and women. We have asked our Defence Force young people to treat women better -                      Mr Speaker, there is no place in this House of Representatives, in the Senate or in our committees for the sort of sexist language that we have heard today and for the sort of sexist language that we have heard in the past. As Minister for Social Inclusion I do not think it is right that half our population should feel excluded by this type of language.                 It is not in order to use offensive words against, make imputations against, or reflect on another Member by means of a quotation or by putting words in someone else's mouth.                 The minister has been quite out of order and when she was asked to withdraw she properly should. She is quite out of order.

  Professor Garnaut has produced a very good report, a quite important set of findings to deal with dangerous climate change which emphasises just how important it is to our future economic prosperity that we reduce carbon pollution. He makes the point so strongly that the cost of not acting is far greater than the cost of acting and, therefore, we as a nation need to come to grips with this fundamental challenge. We will come to grips with this fundamental challenge because everybody on this side of the House believes in the science of climate change, unlike those opposite. Everyone on this side of the House knows we have to do something about it. Those on that side of the House do not understand it whatsoever.                      They are so politically opportunistic that we get questions like this day after day that are simply a nonsense. They know that the recommendations that Professor Garnaut has made will come to the government -                      and we will make up our mind in consultation with the multi-party committee about the direction in which we will go. But they want to come into the House, because they are so embarrassed about their clear lack of an alternative, and make all sorts of assertions which are simply not true. The thing they are most embarrassed about is the finding by Professor Garnaut that their so-called direct action policy, which is really a no action policy, will cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every year. This is what Professor Garnaut has had to say:                  Other people's taxes have to rise to pay for expenditures under direct action.                     We have made it very clear that we will use the revenue from the carbon price - which will be paid by the 1,000 largest polluters - first of all to assist households and then to assist industry and to invest in important climate change programs. We have made that absolutely clear.                  Professor Garnaut has made a series of recommendations. We will follow some maybe and we may not follow some. We are considering these in a methodical way, working through all the issues with the multi-party committee, consulting with business and consulting with the wider community. That is the perfectly rational way to go about making policy and it is the way in which the Australian people expect us to go about making policy. But those on that side of the House have become so negative and so apparently bitter now that there is no rational thought process going on at all on the opposition front bench. If you listen to their questions today, question after question is simply being wasted. It has been an abject performance and one which reflects very poorly on all of them.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The member for Hindmarsh was a very heavy smoker some years ago and kicked his own habit and is living a much healthier life as a result of it, and I am sure he will have a long life as the member for Hindmarsh as well.                 Yesterday I had the opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for finally deciding to support our plain-packaging measures on tobacco. Of course, this is long overdue support for a measure that has been supported by the World Health Organisation, the AMA, the Cancer Council and many other health experts. It took the opposition over a year since this was announced to make up its mind that it would support this measure. That only came after a damaging split on the other side with a number of backbenchers expressing their views. So it is little wonder -                      The interjections will confirm the view of many Australians. It is little wonder that there are concerns about the influence of tobacco companies on public policy debate in Australia. The fact that the coalition has taken $3 million from big tobacco in the last 12 years would obviously raise questions for many. We know that they are the donor of choice for British American Tobacco - 97 per cent of their worldwide donations coming into the pockets of the Liberal Party and the National Party.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can understand why a member who is a doctor when he comes to this House would be sensitive about this.                     I was asked about the influences of tobacco companies on public policy debate and that is absolutely what I am talking about. But, of course, there is good news. There is good news that the tide is turning. There is good news because internationally we are seeing conservative leaders like David Cameron refusing to take tobacco donations. At the state level we see Liberal Premier Colin Barnett refusing to take such donations. It is reported in the media today that there are a number of backbenchers who also support a ban on the coalition taking donations. I quote the member for McMillan. He is in the Age saying that donations should have ended during John Howard's time and 'I'm confident Tony Abbott will end this while he is the leader'. This is great news that Mr Abbott is apparently going to stop taking donations from tobacco companies. Of course, this would be a big turnaround from last Friday when he went on television asking for extra donations. Now there is an allegation or a suggestion that he might be preparing to change his position. I would like to offer the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to come to a joint event -                      I would like to invite the Leader of the Opposition, if these reports of a change of heart are indeed true, to come to a joint event. I know the Cancer Council, the AMA and many others would like to stand up together with every party in this parliament to say that tobacco donations are no more in Australian politics. That would be something we would be proud of.                     We in fact could have a massive banner behind us saying, 'Mr Abbott has kicked his habit.' Unfortunately, we do not know if this is true. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to state whether he is going to refuse tobacco donations, take the lead from his backbench and start leading his own party.

  The very reason we are dealing with dangerous climate change and carbon pollution is so that we can preserve the jobs of the future, so our country does not fall so far behind, so that our important industries like steel and coal are not under threat from carbon tariffs. We understand the need to deal with carbon pollution. We also understand that, particularly when it comes to trade-exposed industries, there will need to be assistance. We understand that. It was understood by the previous government. It was understood by former Prime Minister Howard. It was understood by the member for Wentworth. It is not understood by this Leader of the Opposition and certainly not understood by the shadow Treasurer.                 We have a commitment to supporting employment in Australia and making our economy much more prosperous. The only growth future that we have is a low-pollution growth future. If we do not begin to make a move here, we will be left behind and so many of our important industries will be left stranded. But those on that side of the House do not have the gumption to stand up and take the really difficult decisions. We on this side of the House know how important it is to make sure we make the transition to a low-pollution economy of the future. So we drive the investment in renewable energy; that is why we need a price on carbon. We need a price on carbon so we can continue to be a great trading nation, so that all of those people who work in energy intensive industries are not discriminated against in international trade.                     We understand all of these things because we understand the need to really embrace the big challenges of the future. Just as we had the gumption to stand up during the global recession, just as we have had the gumption to deal with the issues that have arisen from the floods in Queensland and elsewhere, we understand the importance of taking the hard decisions. Those on that side of the House do not understand that. They are not tough enough to face up to these challenges. The Leader of the Opposition over there wants to say no to everything. He wants to be a political opportunist.                     What motivates everybody in the Labor Party is jobs. That is what motivates everybody on this side of the House. That is what motivates us. We know your record when it comes to jobs.                     During the global recession, we on this side of the House stood up for Australian jobs and they sent up the white flag. Nothing was more embarrassing than the performance of the now Leader of the Opposition. He was up there in the dining room with the former Treasurer when the key vote was going on. He could not muster enough conviction to come into the House and vote for Australian jobs. Everybody remembers that evening in this House because they would not stand up for Australian jobs. They never have and they never will.

  Thank you to the member for Reid for his question. To meet the challenge of climate change we need to embark on a long-term transformation of our economy. We have got to break the link between economic growth and growth in our pollution. We have got to continue to improve living standards, improve employment, improve growth, improve productivity, but do it in an environmentally sustainable way. Economies that make that transformation in the 21st century are the economies that will have the competitive edge. Tackling climate change by pricing carbon is going to position our economy to be competitive in the long term. To set up this country and our economy for that historic transformation we have to overcome some old mindsets. We cannot afford to revert to the old discredited, protectionist, anti-market instincts of the past. We have to continue with the tradition of economic reform that has characterised the last 25 years of public policy making in this country, in particular, and we have to be honest about the challenge that is ahead of us. The Leader of the Opposition is failing on both of those fronts. He attempts to deceive, to misrepresent the facts and he has abandoned economic reform.                 Consider some of the deceptions and misrepresentations of the facts that the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in. A week or so ago he claimed that the Climate Commission's new science report vindicated his subsidies for polluters policy. In fact, when you look at the report it explicitly states that policies like subsidies for polluters 'have the potential to lock in more severe climate change for the future'. It is an explicit, wilful, misrepresentation of the facts. He has also consistently misrepresented Professor Garnaut's work, including in question time yesterday and again in question time today. He has completely misrepresented, deliberately and wilfully, the proposition put forward for an independent committee to consider the circumstances of setting targets and caps and making recommendations to government and parliament about them. He has been travelling around the country visiting regions and workplaces, consistently misrepresenting -                      I withdraw, Mr Speaker.                     On his scare campaign, the Leader of the Opposition consistently refers to some modelling done under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme by the Treasury and the scenario of a $26 a tonne carbon price and then goes on to completely misrepresent the findings in relation to the price impacts. One clear example on his scare campaign tour around the country has been his claim that there would be a five per cent increase in food prices when the publicly available modelling that he is relying upon clearly demonstrates and states a 0.6 to 0.8 per cent increase in food prices. He is completely misrepresenting the facts and totally and conveniently ignoring the fact that under that arrangement the government had undertaken to provide generous household assistance. It goes on and on and on. The opposition leader's record on this issue is a disgraceful catalogue of serial misrepresentations, mindless negativity - no, no, no; stop, stop, stop - and it is unbecoming of a person who seeks the leadership of this nation.

  I say firstly to the Leader of the Opposition, one thing I know he never does is quote someone accurately. Let us remember the unseemly display we had yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition was twisting Professor Ross Garnaut's words to suit his fear campaign rather than quoting accurately. Here we have again another day, another looking for the fear campaign and looking for the angle. The one thing the Leader of the Opposition never does when he walks into this place is look out for the national interest and the national interest lies in getting on with the job of putting a price on carbon. We have a high emissions economy. We need to cut carbon pollution, we need to do the right thing by the environment and we need to create a clean energy economy for the future. If you care about the environment and cutting carbon pollution then you want to see action on climate change. If you care about economic efficiency then you want to see that action by putting a price on carbon. If you care about putting the burden where the burden should lie then you would put a price on carbon that big polluters pay because it is the big polluters who are in a position to change how they do their work and to create less carbon pollution. Then you would use that revenue as we are proposing to do: the majority of it to assist Australian households, protect Australian jobs and fund programs which will see us transition to a clean energy economy. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will continue to push -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was explaining, the carbon pricing regime that we are determined to bring into place is one where we put the burden on big polluters and we assist Australian families. What the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is put the burden on Australian families and assist the big polluters. Whenever he is given a choice of looking after Australian families - looking after the people who actually need the actions of government to assist them - he does not look after their interests, he chooses the interests of the big side of town. Whether it is big tobacco or big polluters, that is where he always finds what he wants to do next. We believe in putting the burden on big polluters to cut carbon pollution and to assist Australian families. I know the Leader of the Opposition believes in putting additional taxes on Australian families and using that hard earned money to subsidise big polluters.                 There is a reason the Leader of the Opposition is in a bit of a frenzy about all of this today and maybe it is because the penny has just dropped with him following the performance of Senator Barnaby Joyce on Lateline last night. He will be going to the 2013 election saying to Australian pensioners, 'I want to cut your pension,' and saying to Australian families, 'I want to take money out of your budget and bring it back to the government so I can give it to big polluters.' That is the proposition that he will take to the next election: cut the pension, take money off Australian families and give it to the big polluters. It is his policy, I will let him defend it, because I cannot imagine what the defence for that is going to be.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I know how keen she is to see us protect our environment and to see us have a clean energy economy for the future. And I think the Hansardshould record that her question about Kakadu National Park was met with jeers from the opposition, including, 'Who cares!' - who cares about Kakadu National Park. In this parliament, let me tell you who cares: the Australian people do. That is why, 20 years ago, Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke determined to add to the protections of Kakadu National Park, to add to the area of the park and to protect it from mining - a brave decision 20 years ago. That decision 20 years ago was trenchantly opposed by the opposition - by the Liberal Party and by the National Party. And, Mr Speaker, in words you might find eerily familiar, they were saying that they had to oppose this move by Prime Minister Bob Hawke because, unless they did so, the mining industry in this country would be dead. Those words are ringing in my ears: the mining industry in this country would be dead. They had to act to stop Bob Hawke protecting Kakadu because it would kill the mining industry. To use the words of the former opposition leader Alexander Downer, he went so far as to say, 'The decision' - believe it or not I am quoting this - 'will do Australia irreparable damage in the mainstream of the capitalist world.' That is what protecting Kakadu National Park was going to do. It generated huge headlines: 'Coronation Hill to make or break the mining industry'.                 Well, with the benefit of 20 years, let us just reflect on how accurate this fear campaign was. Let us just go through it. Are we damaged in the mainstream of the capitalist world because we protected Kakadu? I do not think so. Is the mining industry dead in this country because we protected Kakadu, with the most recent official figures saying there is more than $400 billion of investment in the pipeline? Here we stand 20 years later and here in my hands is a report about what could happen to Kakadu as a result of climate change. This is telling us that saltwater intrusion into Kakadu would change its ecology, would damage its tourism potential because you would not be able to get to all areas in parts of the year, would cut down on the amount of bush tucker that was available for Indigenous people and would also cut down on the tourism enterprises that they participate in. Twenty years later and here is this report on climate change and Kakadu.                 As we go about addressing climate change, what do we hear again from the opposition? 'It is going to kill the mining industry. It is going to stop the Australian economy. It is going to stop jobs,' and so on and so forth. Twenty years gives you a bit of a perspective - a stupid scare campaign then and of course this is a stupid scare campaign now. In 20 years time people will look back on this Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him with the absolute wonderment and sense of disgust with which we look back now on the people who opposed protecting Kakadu.

 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can certainly tell him this: the member for Corangamite and the Corio are constantly talking to me about Ford in Geelong. They talked to me during the days of the global financial crisis.                    They talked to me during the days of the global financial crisis, when it was unbelievably pressing as to whether or not we would be able to save Australian jobs and to hold manufacturing in this country, particularly the manufacturing of cars. We could see what was happening around the world and we could see particularly what has happening in the United States, and both the members for Corio and Corangamite made representations to government about working with Ford and working with the car industry to protect Australian jobs. The Leader of the Opposition slept through all of the divisions on the enabling legislation to protect those jobs, so he did not care about it then. He was asleep - literally asleep - whilst we were protecting those Australian jobs.                 The members for Corio and Corangamite have talked to me in the past about Work Choices.                     As I was saying, yes, the members do represent the interests of Ford and its workforce in this place. They represented it during the days of Work Choices when of course the Leader of the Opposition was out there defending pay cuts and out there defending people getting sacked unfairly, getting sacked for no reason at all. In those days the members for Corangamite and Corio were representing their community and fighting to get rid of Work Choices as the Leader of the Opposition fought to keep it. Of course, in this period of government, the members for Corangamite and Corio have raised with me a series of issues about Ford, including issues involving skills development at Ford. They have raised with me issues about manufacturing and the pressures from the strong Australian dollar. They have of course raised with me issues about climate change. And, for example, the Climate Commission has gone to Geelong. My recollection is that its first public meeting was in Geelong. The Climate Commission is out there talking to people about how we can address climate change. Of course the local members have been involved in all of these processes.                 What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that those local members are doing what positive local members with a vision for the country do - that is, as we go about big policy changes like pricing carbon, they represent the interests of their constituents in those changes, the interests of their constituents in making sure we do the right thing to protect the environment, the interests of their constituents in making sure we cut carbon pollution and the interests of their constituents in making sure we act to protect Australian jobs, including jobs in manufacturing cars, as we make the transition to a clean energy future. But you can only properly represent your constituents if you come into this place with an idea and you pursue it. You can never represent the issues of your constituents or the nation properly if all you think leadership is is saying no.

  I do thank the member for Corangamite because he knows an awful lot more about representing working people than the Leader of the Opposition. I bet the Leader of the Opposition fought hard in the Howard cabinet against Work Choices!                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. This morning, 13 of Australia's most prominent economists, including the former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank and a number of financial market economists, came out strongly in support of a carbon price. In an open letter, the economists declared that a price on carbon pollution is 'a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy'. Westpac's Chief Economist, Bill Evans, who was a signatory to the letter, had this to say:                 The move to more efficient, cleaner energy through a well designed market mechanism to price carbon is a major and desirable structural and economic reform which will help Australia competitively position in a global low carbon economy.                 These are important and well-respected economists who are expressing what really should be obvious common economic sense. It is astonishing that this is a contested issue in national politics. The government is of course committed to taking action on climate change by introducing a carbon price, and we have made clear that more than half the revenue from the carbon price will be used to assist households - in particular, low- and middle-income households - with any price impacts they may face. As the Prime Minister has indicated, one option for delivering that household assistance is to provide tax cuts and increased payments to pensioners and others. Of course last night the Nationals Senate leader, Senator Joyce, confirmed that a coalition government would repeal any tax cuts, pension increases and household assistance measures provided under the carbon price. This is what Senator Joyce had to say:                  ... of course we've said from the outset that we would not introduce a tax and we'll repeal it if it comes in, and of course if you're repealing the tax, you're repealing the mechanisms that go with it.                 Clear and unequivocal - Senator Joyce has confirmed that the coalition would in effect impose a double whammy on pensioners, on families and on ordinary householders. Firstly it would scrap the tax cuts, increases in the pension and increases in family payments introduced by the government, and secondly it would increase taxes by up to $720 a household -                      to raise the money that it needs for its subsidies-for-polluters policy, which of course will pay billions of taxpayers' funds to the largest polluters in our economy. We have had today a range of expert economists from major banks, think tanks, universities and the financial services sector all backing the government's plan to price carbon. But the opposition have not been able to find one credible economist, not one at all, to back their subsidies-for-polluters policy. Their policy has no credibility whatsoever; it will simply impose a massive burden on Australian households.

  Members across the government raise with me all the time issues of interest to their constituents. You would expect that, and it occurs. But because it is the Leader of the Opposition who is asking the question we all know where this is going. He is going to keep pursuing his scare campaign about people's jobs. It is absolutely irresponsible of the Leader of the Opposition to keep pursuing this kind of scare campaign. Here he is today pursuing it again, trying to personalise it to individual electorates, but it is the same scare campaign.                 I understand that as the Leader of the Opposition pursues his scare campaign he is making people anxious. I would say to those people who have heard his words and who have become anxious from those words: remember the scare campaigns past that came to nothing. I have pointed out one today about Kakadu - a scare campaign by the Liberal and National parties that came to nothing. I was in this parliament as the shadow minister responsible for our workplace relations campaigning during the days of Work Choices. Day after day they came into this place, including the Leader of the Opposition, saying that if one word of the Work Choices act were changed - just one word - then jobs in this country would go backwards, there would be more unemployment, growth would go backwards, we would end the mining industry and there would be no more investment. Let us look at the track record compared with those words.                     The track record of that Work Choices scare campaign is now before all of us: 750,000 jobs created during a global financial crisis, half a million more to be created in the next two years and a boom in mining. Of course local members raise with me the situation of the steel industry. If the Leader of the Opposition was trying to tell anything like the truth, he would know that the truth for the Australian steel industry is that it is under pressure because of the high Australian dollar. The steel industry recorded losses last year and is looking at recording losses this year.                     This is because of circumstances for the industry. The Leader of the Opposition cannot say that financial results from last year were somehow impacted by the government's plans to price carbon. Yes, it is a tough time in steel; yes, businesses have been losing money; yes, of course there is pressure from the high Australian dollar; and, yes, I listen to the views of the local members who represent the steel industry in this place when we talk about how we can support the steel industry.                 I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that his gross irresponsibility is to pretend that those real issues for steel are something to do with carbon pricing. It is actually contemptuous of the workers in steel and contemptuous of the Australian steel industry. I am sure that the people who represent steel in this place will be going back to their electorates to make that perfectly clear. He could not care less; it is just fodder for his fear campaign.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. The simple answer is: no, I will not rule out the capitals. I will tell you the reason. The member has asked a very valid question about Perth Airport. What they have to understand, if they are serious about developing regions, is the importance of the linkage to the capital. They need to understand that Perth Airport is fundamental to the economic development of the West. It was the WA government that nominated Perth Airport for the Infrastructure Australia Fund. We have a funding partnership with the government of WA to address that point.                 But just think of the regions that are around here. If we are really going to diversify the economic base - and I believe that is what this budget is all about: a patchwork economy in transition, with the patches being the regions - we have to understand there is no point urging regions to diversify their economic base, whether it is adding value to food, the mining and resource sector or the renewable energy sector and all of the things that go with it, if you cannot get the distribution change right. If what we want is to get diversification to compete on a global market, we have to get efficiency through the key hubs, and a lot of those hubs happen to be capital cities.                  So I urge the member, when he looks at the question of regional development - and this is the discussion we are having with the WA government -                      I will come to that in a minute. When we look at the question of the development of the partnership with the WA government, in the state from which the member for O'Connor comes, and the discussions I have had with Brendan Grylls about place based approaches, we clearly understand the importance of those connections to the capital hubs as well as the key regional hubs. It is for that reason that I will not rule metropolitan cities out of receiving funds for projects under the Regional Development Australia Fund. We have made the key point that our focus is going to be on better opportunity for the regions so that they can make their patches work better.                 As for the interjections that come from the other side about funding something at Circular Quay, I will remind the House that, when they were in office running their regional rorts program, they even funded the lifesaving club in Bondi for the then member for Wentworth. If you call that regional development, you have to be kidding yourself.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. We do accept that there is an important role that scientists play in informing the Australian community and policymakers about the right kinds of decisions that need to be made in this parliament to deal with dangerous climate change. We recognise that we have a great scientific tradition in this country. We have had great scientists like Professor McFarlane Burnet or Peter Doherty, who won the Nobel Prize. They themselves are evidence for us of the contribution that scientists can make. We also know that in our electorates, for example at the University of New South Wales in my electorate of Kingsford Smith, there are scientists who provide us with researched and considered policy advice about what we ought to be doing as a country to deal with the very great challenges we face.                 Today in parliament I was very pleased to give the blazers to 23 of our youngest best and brightest - the young Australian Maths and Science Olympiad team. They are going to compete against the best and brightest around the world. They will be the scientists of the future who will help us to deal with the challenges of the future.                  It was with some alarm that I read the reports in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald of remarks by Dr Peter Phelps, a whip in the Liberal government of New South Wales, about scientists. I say this because I think that we are at a junction point where, if the parliament does not express its confidence in the work that scientists do and the role that they play, in the public arena that confidence can be reduced. Dr Phelps got to his feet and said:                 I comment in this place on the latest adventures in the great global warming swindle that is gripping our nation and most of the formerly civilised world.                 He went on to say:                 At the heart of many scientists _ lies the heart of a totalitarian planner. One can see them now, beavering away, alone,  unknown in their laboratories.                 Regrettably, he then went on to associate the work that these scientists do with the rise of Nazism. This is the most serious and rancid charge that can be brought by anyone in a house of parliament in this country. I do note that the government whip we are referring to has associations with members in this House. This is someone who has worked as an adviser for the member for Mackellar, worked as an adviser for Senator Ronaldson and was the chief of staff, as it were, for the former member for Eden-Monaro.                     The fact is that scientists have a valuable and important role to play in our society, and that is accepted and understood in all sections of the Australian community. But here we have someone who is the government whip in the parliament of New South Wales making the most grave associations that can be imagined about our science community. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are the leader of the Liberal coalition in this country, you should call on both the Premier of New South Wales and this member to repudiate those comments. Those opposite might make light about these assertions, but we know that the extremism of the Liberal Party is coming to the centre, and as it comes to the centre it will infect the body politic. We will be committed to supporting scientists and recognising the valuable role that they play, and it is time that the Leader of the Opposition got on board.

  Yet again here we have the Leader of the Opposition winding up for his fear campaign. He is listing individual businesses, and then he is going to say to the workers at those businesses that there is some threat to their jobs. It is absolutely disgraceful, particularly as it comes from the man who just used a reference to Holden. This is the man who slept through the economic stimulus package, and if you had ever been to Holden, as I have, and had ever talked to anybody from Holden, as I have, then you would know that the way in which this government worked with Holden during the global financial crisis was absolutely pivotal to Holden retaining its manufacturing here in this country. The Leader of the Opposition is a man who could not even be bothered voting on the economic stimulus package, so little interested was he in the fortunes of the people -                      Of course I receive representations from members across the government about matters of concern to their constituents every day of the week, and I certainly received representations about things like supporting Holden during the global financial crisis, when we were working as hard as we possibly could to save jobs and the Leader of the Opposition was literally asleep.                 We all know that the Leader of the Opposition is naming these businesses so he can then go and scare people who work in them. What I would say to the people who work in those businesses is: let us have a look at the track record. The Leader of the Opposition is a senior member of the government that said time after time that if we did not keep Work Choices then unemployment would skyrocket, industrial disputes would skyrocket, economic growth would plunge, we would not be competitive with the rest of the world and it would be the end of the mining industry. But every scare campaign point that they made about Work Choices has been proved by the benefit of experience since we got rid of Work Choices to be absolutely and completely wrong in every way. Jobs are being created, there is unemployment with a figure four in front of it, growth is being maintained, the resource sector has billions and billions of dollars of investment in the pipeline and industrial disputes are still on a trend down - every piece of the scare campaign about Work Choices was wrong. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition yet again engaged in a scare campaign. What working people should recognise is that if he has been so wrong on those occasions what is the likelihood that he is right now? None. So this scare campaign should be rejected for what it is - an attempt to cause anxiety, but not because the Leader of the Opposition is really interested in anybody's job. He has never been interested in anybody's job. He would have been active during the global financial crisis if he was genuinely interested in jobs. He would have opposed Work Choices if he was genuinely interested in job security. No, this is about chiselling out a bit of political interest against the national interest. He does not care who he hurts or who he scares in the meantime. This is a scare campaign that is really all about his political profit. There is not one bone in his body that is concerned in any way about the prospects of the working people in those businesses he has named. Of course, this is the man who gave them Work Choices. They are not going to believe he is concerned now.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her interest in the economy. We know our economy has taken a very significant hit from this summer's natural disasters, but we know that it has not been knocked off its long-term course. The good news is that mines are reopening and affected communities are getting back on their feet, as is our economy. We can see that in the data today. Australia recorded another trade surplus in April and thermal coal volumes out of Queensland have bounced back after recent flooding. Coal export values rose 1.4 per cent in April and they are now up almost 16 per cent over the past two months. Iron ore and metal exports rose 3.8 per cent in April and they are now up 23 per cent over the past two months. We saw the retail sales figures today and they are up by a strong 1.1 per cent in April - that is the biggest monthly increase in 17 months. So I think we can all be proud of what Australians have done. The business community has been working together with the unions and the wider community, and we have really pulled together in the face of adversity.                 The way in which everyone pulled together was very much evident in Queensland during the floods. Of course, that is what we did during the global recession. That is what we did in the worst economic conditions in 75 years and Australia emerged from that as virtually the only advanced economy to avoid a recession. That has been very important because it has been that strength which has stood us in such good stead. We are still working in Queensland to rebuild that state, including restoring and recovering over 6,600 kilometres of the state road network and over 4,400 kilometres of the Queensland rail network.                 Our focus has to be on getting the fundamentals right and bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 so that we do not compound the price pressures which will flow from the very strong investment pipeline. It also means that we have to make the investment in a bigger workforce and a better trained workforce. We have to continue to invest in critical infrastructure and, of course, we have to put a price on carbon if we are going to lock-in our future prosperity.                 Now, all of these things could have been very different if those opposite had been in charge during this period. They did not recognise the threat of the global recession. The shadow Treasurer described it as a hiccup - the worst event in the global economy since the Great Depression was just a hiccup! We heard the shadow Treasurer just yesterday say that the impact of the floods in Queensland and more widely was simply a cough in the mining boom. They have not a clue about the human dimensions of these events and no concern for the fate of all of those communities. We on this side of the House understand the importance of rebuilding and the importance of investing, but those on that side of the House have no policy to come back to surplus, no policy for jobs and no policy to tackle climate change. It is little wonder that all of the colleagues of the shadow Treasurer do not think he is up to the job.

  We have just heard yet another demonstration of the economic incompetence of all of those opposite. He wants to somehow pretend that the South Australian economy is not connected to the national economy. We have been in this House day after day, and we have seen baseless scare campaign after baseless scare campaign, but that question takes the cake. We had a contraction in the national economy of 1.2 per cent in the national accounts yesterday and that has hurt right around the country. Of course there are regional differences and we do have a patchwork economy, but anybody who knows about the national accounts will know that when you look at the state-by-state breakdowns they are volatile and you cannot just see them one quarter by one quarter. You cannot look at them like that, and nobody who is serious about economics even tries to look at them like that. But, we are absolutely serious on this side of the House about supporting the economy nationally and supporting it right around our country. And it was not the only state that went backwards on the quarterly figures. The fact is, we had a really hard hit and those on that side of the House want to ignore the fact it happened at all.                 In his budget reply the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this House for 30 minutes and did not mention the single biggest economic event in our economy this year - and, in fact, as it turns out, in 30 years.                     Within his analysis of the challenges he could not find -                      So those on that side of the House are in complete denial about the dramatic impact on our economy of the natural disasters that occurred earlier this year. The biggest natural disasters in Australia's history. The biggest economic effect in Australia's history. They produced a negative figure for our economy of 1.2 per cent in the quarter, and he wants to somehow pretend that it did not impact in South Australia or any other state. This is truly bizarre. They do not understand the basic economics of what is happening in our economy. How could they possibly run the country?

  I thank the member for Hunter and Chief Government Whip for that question. Indeed, this week has seen some substantial progress on the rollout of fast, affordable, universal broadband. We believe that the NBN is the single most important piece of infrastructure that we could deliver for the 21st century economy. It is important in terms of securing our future prosperity. It will change the way that we work and it will change the way that we live.                 Just this week the minister released the bold and visionary Digital Economy Strategy. This shows how the NBN will position Australia among the best countries in the world for broadband connection. We announced $60 million in new programs to help communities, small businesses and teachers maximise opportunities from the NBN. We announced that NBN Co. has reached agreement for the first large-scale deployment of fibre-optic cable for the NBN covering almost 40 per cent of construction activity planned for the next two years. Also, we confirmed another agreement worth up to $1.1 billion to deploy next-generation fixed wireless broadband to regional and rural areas so that commercial fixed wireless services can start mid next year, with the full rollout finished by 2015.                 I was also asked about how this has been received and the importance of e-communication to members of parliament and members of the general community. You would think that with all of these positive programs the opposition would have something to say. But we are now at June and we still have not had a question on these issues by the shadow minister in this House. Not one for all of 2011.                 There are explanations why the shadow minister has a bit of an aversion when it comes to emails, given his experience in the past, because we know that last week the member for Leichhardt sent an email to all of his colleagues - it was nothing personal - chastising the member for Wentworth for not -                      I certainly am, Mr Speaker, because as Leader of the House I was asked directly about the importance of e-communication to members of parliament. I understand the embarrassment of those opposite with regard to these issues. They say of course that it was not personal. Well, the member for Calare missed a division just this morning, so I am sure there will be an email out there bagging him, as well, just like the member for Wentworth got an email about this issue.                 But so divided are those opposite that they had to issue a press release saying that the shadow minister was having dinner with the shadow Treasurer on Tuesday night. They are so divided that they cannot bring themselves to engage in a debate about the National Broadband Network. You cannot say that the National Broadband Network is a significant piece of infrastructure in this country and then have nothing to say for it. But we know that the member for Wentworth was given the job of wrecking the NBN. And I note that the Leader of the Opposition was out at a wreckers earlier today. How appropriate that the wrecker was at a wreckers earlier today.

  At the core of this government's agenda is a productivity agenda, and during 12 years in office those opposite did not have a productivity agenda. We on this side of the House have a productivity agenda. Our productivity agenda is one in which we invest in the skills and the education of all of our people. That has been at the core of our agenda from day one, but because there has been a structural decline in our productivity over a long period of time, principally during the period in office of those opposite, it will take some time to deal with.                 You do not retrain a workforce in a year. You do not retrain a workforce in two years. You do not lift the quality of an educational system in one or two years. You do not lift the quality of higher education in two or three years. A real fair dinkum productivity agenda takes time and those opposite did not have a productivity agenda over 12 long years in office. They left us with an infrastructure deficit and a deficit when it came to investment in education and training.                 They may well go to the recent national accounts, but there is one thing that does show out through the recent national accounts and that is very simply that we did see a big hit to output in the recent national accounts. Why did we see that? Because a lot of people in places like Queensland were still in employment but there was no output. That is why you will see a blip in the productivity figures in this set of national accounts.                 As we have seen, those opposite do not even understand what happened during the floods and have absolutely no idea of the magnitude of destruction and what it caused in many of the regional towns around Queensland. I know that some members over there understand it and some do not. So you do see a fall in the recent national accounts when it comes to productivity, particularly during this period, but we on this side of the House have a long-term productivity agenda. Those on that side of the House have no such thing and that is why they are so unqualified for high office.

  I thank the member for her question. The Gillard government is completing the overhaul of the fuel excise statement. We seek to ensure that there is a consistent and neutral tax regime for all fuels used by vehicles. We on this side of the House believe that all road users should pay their fair share and we also believe in getting our budget into surplus by 2012-13.                     We intend to set excise rates for fuels capable of being used by internal combustion engines. We are putting into place, including the excise system, gaseous alternative fuels. Today, we have outlined a 50 per cent discount on the fuel energy content for the excise to be set for LPG and other gaseous fuels and we have outlined a five-year transition path.                 The transition path has been longer than five years because the first people to propose including LPG and gaseous fuels in the excise system were none other those in the opposition when they were in government. In the 2003 budget, then Treasurer Costello said it was appropriate to include LPG in the fuel tax system. So this has been a process which has been underway since 13 May 2003 and we are determined to finish the job.                 I also note for the interest of the House that, due to the superb advocacy of regional Labor MPs and crossbench MPs, we will exempt ethanol and biofuel for 10 years. These reforms will ensure a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality for fuels. I do not mean to make the Leader of the Opposition yawn. He has had one talk with Senator Nick Minchin on this topic and, in fact, when we looked at what we were doing in this process we found this has been in the forward estimates since 2003. I have to report to the House that the government cannot claim credit for this policy. We should share the credit. We are finishing the job but we did not start the job. I quote Peter Costello's media release -                      I do not know why the member for Higgins is interrupting - she probably wrote this - but Peter Costello said:                 The reforms will establish a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels.                 But this policy, which has been here since 2003, does not just stop there. There is more. Indeed, I go to the grand old man of the Liberal Party, none other than John Winston Howard. He released a press release on these very same matters on which I address the House today, but he released it on 16 December 2003. History is truly inconvenient to those opposite. He said:                 Today I announce an overhaul of the fuel excise system.                 How sad it is they no longer listen to their former leader. The then Prime Minister Howard said:                  These reforms -                    he is referring to excise and including LPG; John Howard said this, friends -                  will result in a more consistent and neutral tax regime for fuels used in vehicles.                 It does not stop there. The country cousin of the Liberals, John Anderson - he was a real leader of the National Party - put out a press release on the same day back in 2003 and he said: 'Excise decision boosts regional Australia'. Come on, Nats! Get on board with the regions. In fact, as I looked through the newspaper clippings I came to the Age of 27 May. Nick Minchin also said: 'The Liberal Party will never get into government by opposing good policy. We should stand up and support the sorts of policies which are good policy.' I congratulate the member for Higgins and Senator Ryan for standing up for good policy.

  To the statement or whatever it was that the member for Mackellar just came and spoke at the dispatch box about, can I say this: the Treasurer is doing a fantastic job selling a budget that is about jobs and opportunity for the nation.                     Of course we are seeing this reaction by the Liberal Party, because they do not care about jobs, they do not care about a strong economy and they do not care about opportunity.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was, of course, very conscious when I used the word 'jobs' that the opposition would jeer. They just do not care. I knew when I used the word 'opportunity' the opposition would jeer. They just do not care. And I knew when I used the words 'strong economy' the opposition would jeer, because they do not understand the importance of a strong economy to this nation's future. So that is exactly what I expected them to do, because in the modern age - and it does pain me to say it because it has not been true of the Liberal and National parties in the past - the only role that they have is to try and wreck, destroy and create fear. They have no policies or plans for the nation's future.                 Let's just start with the budget and a strong economy. Nothing matters to working families more than keeping the economy strong. The transition our economy is in now requires bringing the budget back to surplus. The Treasurer, working with other members of the economic team, has taken the decisions to get that done. Meanwhile, over there on the opposition front bench, we have had no budget reply and no plan to return the budget to surplus, because they do not have the intellectual capacity or desire to do something in the nation's interest. This week we have had to watch the absolute shambles of the shadow Treasurer blaming his poor budget reply on the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Goldstein.                     Thank you, very much, Mr Speaker. I am relating my response very directly to what the member for Mackellar asked. The member for Mackellar should note that in order to act as the leadership of this nation you have to be able to make the tough decisions to keep the economy strong. We have done that in the recent budget. The Treasurer did that, leading the economic team to deliver the budget back to surplus. If anybody in the opposition - anybody - has a plan to return the budget to surplus we have not seen it yet. In the greatest display of economic incompetence that this parliament has ever had to witness, we have seen no budget reply from any member of the opposition.                 At the core of the budget are jobs and opportunity. We know that the opposition do not care about jobs. They would have got all the big decisions to support Australian jobs wrong. That is what the budget is about. And it is about opportunity. We know that the opposition do not care anything about opportunity. In government their track record on spreading opportunity was woeful and in opposition all they stand for is cuts to education, apprenticeships, schools and universities - you name it, they want to cut it.                 We will keep pursuing this vision. I will do it; the Deputy Prime Minister will do it. Of course we will seek advice from those who have served the Australian nation well. I would have thought, if there were a modicum of interest in the nation's future from those opposite, they would be happy to see that someone of the capacity of Ken Henry was still available for public service in the interests of the nation. But cheap politics is all they know.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question, particularly because he has had such longstanding interest in electoral matters and donations and the influence that they may or may not have on public policy in this House.                 It is vitally important that, when it comes to public health, the government and the parliament listen to public health experts and not to big tobacco companies. Of course, that might be hard when your party relies on millions of dollars coming from tobacco companies to run election campaigns. In fact, as we now know, 97 per cent of British American Tobacco's worldwide donations go to the Australian Liberal and National parties. That is why the coalition has found it so hard to grapple with our plain packaging measures.                 I saw online today something that members on our side of the House, in particular, may not have seen. That is that the Menzies House online journal has exposed the coalition members who argued in the party room against plain packaging. There are some likely and some unlikely members of that group. Among the likely members were the member for Mitchell and the member for Hume. Perhaps a little more unlikely is the member for Paterson. I have a bit of a soft spot for the member for Paterson - sorry, I have to admit that. But he was against this measure.                     It is true. The Prime Minister thinks I am a bit unwell now. Someone I have less of a soft spot for is the member for Mackellar, who said that she is against the banning of tobacco advertising. But the person who takes the cake is Senator Minchin, who said that it was cheaper just to let smokers die.                 These links between big tobacco and the Liberal Party run very deep. Of course, Mr Morris, who is a serial employee of tobacco companies, having worked for British American Tobacco and now as a lobbyist for Philip Morris, is exerting his influence amongst members of the Liberal Party. The only way we can butt out the influence of tobacco companies in this parliament is to make sure that every party stops taking donations from tobacco. I see that the member for McMillan announced in the paper today that he is confident that the Leader of the Opposition will ban tobacco donations while he is the leader.                     Today the member for McMillan has gone even further, announcing that this will happen in conjunction with the leader. The member for Moore has suggested that he stands ready to move a motion at the Liberal Party federal council to ban donations. I need to quote this, of course. The member for Moore said:                 I'd be happy to do it, but I would try to get someone more senior to do it. The leader would be ideal _                 It would be nice for leaders to lead on something like this. Of course, Mr Abbott could move this motion. He could butt out the influence of tobacco companies on public debate in this parliament right here and right now if he wanted to, but he would have to have the guts to do it.

  They are simply making it up, yet again. They are trying to peddle fear. They are making it up because they are so acutely embarrassed by the fact that they have all been exposed as climate change deniers. That is why we are seeing this fear campaign. We are seeing a fear campaign because they do not believe that climate change is a problem for our country. Their leader is now exposed. He has not got the character, he has not got the conviction and he has not got the toughness to actually provide a policy alternative in this House. So what do we see?                     I was directly relating my material to the question. What we have here is a scare campaign because those opposite are so embarrassed by the fact that the Liberal Party and National Party in this House are now run and dominated by climate change deniers. The consequence of that is that they are not up to the task of putting in place the policies our country needs to secure our prosperity for the future.                 What we have is an opposition leader who is simply a hollow man, and he is backed up by a shadow Treasurer who is simply the same. We have a shadow Treasurer over there who once believed in the science of climate change, but no longer. He is so bereft of any conviction that he has to put out a message on Twitter asking people what he should think. That is the lack of conviction of the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition. They have all become climate change deniers.                 I notice that the member for Wentworth is sitting there embarrassed at the performance of all of those on the front bench and of the members behind him because he belled the cat on their so-called direct action policy.                     I am bringing my answer to a conclusion -                      This is the same scare campaign that we saw during the global financial crisis. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say then. Mr Hockey said:                 _ 300,000 Australians are going to lose their jobs in its first term.                 That is what he said about the government during the global financial crisis. Well, what happened? We now have another example of a scare campaign. All this is about is that they no longer believe in the science of climate change and are not up to the task of putting forward an alternative policy for Australia.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that very concerted work has been in train following the decision of the government, through the cabinet meeting last week, to suspend live exports to Indonesia. Indeed, that work continued at a pace throughout the long weekend and many public servants, many representatives of the cattle industry and, of course, the minister himself were directly engaged in that work over the weekend.                 As I advised the Leader of the Opposition in more informal discussion before parliament formally started, of course, the government is working through issues associated with animal welfare for animals that had already been moved or were mustered on properties awaiting export before the suspension came into effect. We are strongly engaged with the MLA, the industry representative group. The minister has written to the MLA in relation to the making available of $5 million for a hardship fund. We are engaged in inspections and work in Indonesia and there is a very, very quick focus on that. As the Leader of the Opposition's question reflects and as, I think, is common knowledge, not all abattoirs in Indonesia are at the same standards and, of course, we want to work through as expeditiously as possible on inspections so that we can be assured that abattoirs are adopting the world standard about slaughter of animals, and we are encouraging the use of stunning.                 The government has been working through these things methodically and quickly, as I believe my office indicated to the Leader of the Opposition earlier today. We are very happy for the responsible shadow minister, who I understand to be the Leader of the National Party - I assumed it was the Leader of the National Party but, of course, it is a matter for the opposition who the responsible shadow minister is - to get an intensive briefing from the minister. If, following that intensive briefing, there are further questions that the opposition wishes to pursue, then I am, of course, happy to talk about those matters directly with the Leader of the Opposition. I do think it would assist the Leader of the Opposition, through his shadow minister, to get a comprehensive briefing on all actions that have been taken to date and are being taken as we speak.

  I would like to thank the member for Parramatta for her question. As the House is aware, the government is seeking to introduce a carbon price to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. The carbon price will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the companies that are the largest emitters in our economy. However, of course, some industries will pass on the carbon price related costs to consumers, and that is precisely why the government has been upfront with the Australian people that there will be a modest cost impact on households. It is also why the government has consistently made clear that we will be providing fair and generous household assistance and that helping pensioners and low- and middle-income earners will be a priority for the government. On this point specifically, the government has committed that more than 50 per cent of the carbon price revenue -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The government has committed that more than 50 per cent of the carbon price revenue will be used to assist households, that millions of households will be better off under the carbon price and that the assistance will be permanent. As the Prime Minister has indicated, the government is exploring a number of options for delivering that assistance, including through tax cuts. In addition, I can inform the House that all 3.4 million maximum-rate and part-rate pensioners will receive assistance. Under the government's plan, pensioners will receive assistance over and above normal indexation increases from the outset of the carbon price scheme. Therefore, right from the start of the carbon price scheme, literally millions of pensioners will see a real increase in their pension.                 The greatest threat to that increase is the coalition, which has made crystal clear that, upon the introduction of a carbon price, the coalition will remove the assistance to households and remove the increase in pensions. The coalition's policy is to remove the assistance and, in doing so, leave millions of Australians worse off. Whether it is a pension rise or whether it is a tax cut, the Leader of the Opposition has made it absolutely clear that he will claw it back. Unsurprisingly, we see in the papers today that some on the coalition side of politics are horrified that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take money away from households, wants to take money away from pensioners.                  What is worse, it is going to be, from the coalition, a triple hit on families: first, the coalition is going to hit them to fund its paid parental leave scheme; second, the coalition is going to increase taxes on average households by $720 to pay for the 'subsidies for polluters' scheme; and, third, the coalition is going to claw back the assistance the government will have provided to pensioners and households. It is Mr Abbott's great big new pension clawback that we are confronting here. The difference between the government and the coalition could not be more clear: the government will provide assistance to pensioners and householders, and the coalition will take it all away.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I certainly thank him for the reference to the electorate of Capricornia, because, as the Leader of the Opposition may well know, I was very recently in that electorate visiting with the local member there, who does a fantastic job in this place representing that community in this parliament. I want to adopt her words - I am certainly going to give her the credit for these words. As she moves around her community, and people have heard on the radio or seen in the newspapers or seen on the TV screens -                      the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign and scare campaign about the future of the resources industry -                       she actually meets that fear campaign with a very simple line: she says to people, 'Believe your eyes.' Believe your eyes because right throughout that electorate you can see new development. Believe your eyes because that new development will of course be continuing. Believe your eyes because that electorate, like resources based electorates around the country, has a great future with the development of the resources industry.                  These apocryphal statements from the Leader of the Opposition remind me that this is not the first time we have heard fear campaigns about mining. We have had fear campaigns in the past. There was the fear campaign run when Bob Hawke took a brave decision to protect Kakadu and we were told that the mining industry would be closed. What is the truth since?                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am simply reminding us that fear campaigns in the past have been simply that. When we have seen fear campaigns about mining in the past, we have seen mining growth afterwards. That was true of the fear campaign following Kakadu when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister. It was true of the fear campaign run by the coalition about native title. Mining has grown since. It is true of the fear campaign we saw last year by the coalition about the minerals resource rent tax, when now, of course, they are there saying, 'It's okay to put royalties up but mining taxation is fine as long as it is decided upon by a state Liberal government.' Despite all of that fear campaigning, we have seen jobs and investment in mining rise. Of course, the responsible minister was on radio discussing these matters this morning, and I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to his words - and I think these are very wise ones: 'Yes, there are going to be a few gaseous mines challenged, but there is also going to be a huge expansion in this industry that is actually going to create jobs over time.' Let us go through those words again: 'create jobs over time'.                  So, for people who work in mining, what they should be reassured about in the future is that there will be more jobs in mining. For communities that directly rely on mining, what they should be reassured about for the future is that there will be more jobs and more investment in resources. For the Australian economy overall, what people can be reassured about is that there is a huge pipeline of investment into our resources sector. This is a very special time in the Australian economy and it falls to us to make sure that that new prosperity is shared as new opportunities for all Australians. The fear campaign of the Leader of the Opposition will be exposed as just that. The resources industry has a very bright future and people who work in it, like the people in the member for Capricornia's seat, know that from their own experience.

  I thank the member for his question, because the report has been received very well. The report is important in terms of the carbon debate. The report shows the importance of concerted action around the globe. And, of course, the report points to the importance of a carbon price. The commission examined climate change policies in seven out of our top 10 trading partners, including the United States and China. It contains two very important messages. Every single country is putting in place a suite of policies to reduce emissions and to transform their economies. This is understood among our trading partners. There is something like 1,000 policies in place across those countries. So it is overwhelmingly clear that global action is taking place. The second point that it made is very, very important. It says that a carbon price is the most important, cost-effective way to cut pollution. The report says:                  The consistent finding from this study is that much lower cost abatement could be achieved through broad, explicitly carbon-pricing approaches _                 What this report shows is that Australia is not in danger of acting alone. In fact, we are in danger of falling behind. We know, as a result of this report, if we want our businesses to be competitive in the 21st century, we have got to have a clean energy future. Acting on climate change through a carbon price is imperative. That is why business organisations like BCA, AiG and many others are all supporting a market based mechanism. It is why Liberals like the member for Wentworth have supported a market based mechanism. It is why a former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, supported a market based mechanism. It is why Dr Hewson has supported a market based mechanism. It used to be supported as well by the shadow Treasurer.                  The other importance of a market based mechanism is that it does supply the revenue which can be used to assist households and industry to make the transition. The government has made it very clear that we will provide generous assistance to make that transition. It shows us the really clear contrast between the approach of the government with a market based price and the policies of those opposite, which are simply policies of subsidies for polluters. What this report makes very clear is how ineffective a policy of subsidies for polluters is.                     Those on the other side of the House have a policy of subsidies for polluters. They are going to tax our taxpayers to give subsidies to polluters. Of course, in that arrangement there is no revenue to assist pensioners and no revenue to assist households out there that are doing it tough, no revenue whatsoever. That is why there is such unhappiness on that side of the House about their great big pension clawback that they have planned. If they want to come in and take away the generous assistance to pensioners and the generous assistance to households, this absolutely shows how out of touch they are with average families and with pensioners. We on this side of the House will stand up for pensioners and will stand up for average families. Those on that side of the House are standing up for the big polluters.

  What I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that with a carbon price we will see strong economic growth, strong income growth and strong jobs growth. What is clear from the Productivity Commission report and what is clear from modelling that has been conducted by Stern and Garnaut and was conducted for us through the CPRS is that economic growth with a carbon price remains strong, that jobs growth with a carbon price remains strong and that income growth with a carbon price remains strong.                     Because I am a Labor Treasurer, my most fundamental concern is for jobs. It is for job security, it is for more jobs.                      I know that those on that side of the House are not concerned about jobs. What they are concerned about is running a scare campaign. But a price on carbon is important because it drives investment in clean energy. To be a prosperous economy in the 21st century we have to be driven by clean energy and that requires a price on carbon. It does mean as a nation we have to make a significant transition. It does mean that there will be assistance for some industries which are trade exposed and energy intensive. We are absolutely committed to working with those industries because we are concerned about jobs - jobs in the near term, jobs in the medium term and jobs in the long term - because only we on this side of the House have the guts to take the hard decisions to protect our future prosperity.                 Those on that side of the House are running away, running away from the fundamental decisions that need to be taken to support jobs and to create wealth in our economy. They are pretending that they have a policy in this area. Their policy of subsidies for polluters will tax taxpayers and hand the money to industry but it will not necessarily provide any of the assistance for the workers of this country that we are determined to provide. We are absolutely concerned about jobs and we welcome a debate about the future of jobs in this country, because, when we have in the past put in place the big structural reforms, we have done that so we can support jobs, not just more jobs but jobs with higher wages, so a higher living standard for all Australians. That is what reform is about.                 The Liberal Party once used to stand for fundamental reform. They do not any longer. They are now split between two camps. You have the Abbott camp, which is the deniers and they take any opportunity to -                      And we have the Turnbull camp -                      which actually believes in doing something.                     Mr Speaker, the question was about jobs and what we need to do as a community to create jobs and to support jobs. We have made it very clear that we will be supporting energy intensive, trade exposed industries to make the transition. Why are we doing that? Because we want more jobs. We want better jobs and we want a brighter future for all Australians in a sustainable economy.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. He has asked me about the issuing of certificates of no impediment where an Australian citizen is getting married overseas. Of course, what a certificate of no impediment means is that there is no impediment to the recognition of that marriage under Australian law. Given that under Australian law through the Marriage Act a marriage is between a man and a woman, it would not be proper to issue a certificate of no impediment because in truth we do not have the mechanism under current law to recognise a same-sex marriage overseas. I understand that the question of same-sex marriage is a controversial one in the community. I have made my views very well known and the position of the government is also very well known. But I am under no illusion that members in this place and members of the Australian community more broadly have different views on the question of same-sex marriage. As is the way of things in our great Australian democracy, I am sure we will continue to debate that.                 With the certificates of no impediment, it would only be proper to issue those if Australian law changed. Of course, my view and the view of the government is that there should be no change to Australian law in the terms of the Marriage Act. However, the government does have a proud track record of amending Commonwealth legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. There are, by recollection, more than 80 pieces of legislation in which such discrimination has been removed. Such discrimination did impact directly upon the lives of people, for example with superannuation benefits where the benefits could transfer from one member of a couple to another. Those kinds of discrimination and impediment have been dealt with by the government. The Labor policy is to note that state jurisdictions can move to registers and recognitions of relationships and a number of jurisdictions have done so. Indeed the member for Denison represents in this place a state that has moved in that direction. I understand that there will probably be a continuing community debate. I think there will be some intensity in that debate about same-sex marriage, but it would not be appropriate to take the course that the member for Denison asks me to with Australian law and the Marriage Act defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. The member for Canberra may be aware that today I took the opportunity to meet with some plumbers and electricians who work right here in Canberra, right here in the ACT. They came to Parliament House to give me a letter and to give me a very simple message - that is, they want to see us price carbon and they want to see us develop the low-emissions economy of the future. David Golack, the ACT General Manager of the Axis Plumbing Group, who came as well, said to me: 'There are going to be jobs created by the carbon price. There won't only be jobs created for tradespeople; there will also be a considerable knock-on effect for the people who train the tradespeople as well as the people who maintain compliance. We can see further work and job opportunities created as a result of a carbon price based on the green technology opportunities. There are tremendous opportunities ahead.' Those were his words as an employer of plumbers and an employer of apprentices.                 The group was joined by Peter Tighe and Earl Setches from the electrical and plumbing divisions of the CEPU, representing around 80,000 plumbers and electricians. I note that, somewhat curiously, the opposition today appears to be dreadfully interested in the statements of union officials about carbon pricing. This is an opposition that in government never used the word 'union' unless it was in a sentence saying, 'How can we smash the union?' Remember the dogs and balaclavas of Peter Reith, who is now interestingly enough doing the Liberal Party review. One can only imagine the dogs-for-all policy that is going to come out of that. The only time they were interested in the word 'worker' was when they were putting it in a sentence to say, 'How can Work Choices rip pay off a worker?' But today they are pretending an interest in the words of unions, so let us listen to some from Peter Tighe and Earl Setches representing around 80,000 plumbers and electricians: 'Climate change is real and we are well placed to know that because in our industry we are providing the tools to meet the challenges. The costs of carbon pollution in this country have already been felt through water shortages, environmental degradation and pollution. A price on carbon will mean a further boom for jobs and more apprentices.' Those are their words.                 Australia has to act on carbon pollution because we cannot afford to be left behind the standards of the world. The world is moving to create a clean energy future. We cannot afford to be left behind. On that topic so often misrepresented by the Leader of the Opposition, today I was very pleased to launch, with the minister for climate change, a new set of fact sheets which deal comprehensively with how the world is acting. I know the Leader of the Opposition does not like those inconvenient things called facts but they are now in three clear fact sheets for him. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as we continue to talk about the facts, the science of climate change and the facts of pricing carbon, he is threatening Australians with a triple whammy. He wants to put a price on their fruit and vegies at Coles and Woolworths to fund his paid parental leave scheme, he wants to jack up their taxes in order to fund his ridiculous carbon pollution plans and he wants to claw back from Australian pensioners and Australian families the money we will give them in assistance, cutting the amount of money they have in their hands to meet their bills. We will get on with the job of doing the right thing to tackle climate change and to create the clean energy economy of the future.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Welcome back is what I say to him after his recent visit to Nauru. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, and I said it some time ago, is that we of course welcome nations in our region becoming signatories to the refugee convention. That is a good thing. We welcome nations doing that. At an earlier point in time when Nauru indicated it might be interested I said we would be more than happy to make available officials to assist in the technical cooperation to get it done. If Nauru does want to get involved in the refugee convention, that is a good thing.                 But I would point the Leader of the Opposition to words from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who has said today:                 UNHCR would welcome approaches from any state contemplating becoming a party to the refugee convention, but UNHCR's Canberra office is not aware of any formal steps by Nauru in this respect _                 If they do take such formal steps, that is a good thing. But, even if they do take such formal steps, that is not a substitute. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting a detention facility should go there. That is not a substitute for the regional approach we are taking to combating the scourge of people smuggling.                 We want to work through a regional approach. That is what the Bali framework was about. Under the auspices of that Bali framework we are negotiating a transfer agreement with Malaysia. The key difference here is that through the transfer agreement with Malaysia we would say to people smugglers - as we are saying now - and to the asylum seekers that they seek to get on their boats: 'If you pay your money and risk your life, you will not end up in Australia. You will end up in Malaysia.' Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan, which is a fundamentally weaker plan, what would happen is that people smugglers would be able to say to asylum seekers, 'Sure, you will have to go to Nauru, but you will end up in Australia.' The majority of people found to be refugees when the Nauru centre was last in operation ended up in Australia. That is the truth of it.                 We have a choice here between a regional solution and a one-out plan. We have a choice here between a solution that sends the message to people smugglers, 'If you ply your trade and try to bring people to Australia they will not end up in Australia,' and the Leader of the Opposition's weaker position -                      which is that they will end up in Australia after some time on Nauru. That is the difference between the two positions. Ours is a more effective approach to taking out of the hands of people smugglers that very product that they seek to sell to asylum seekers. The Leader of the Opposition's approach is to say that they have the ability to end up in Australia via a detour to Nauru. That is the difference, and we will keep pursuing the agreement with Malaysia.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. A carbon price is the cheapest and fairest way of reducing Australia's carbon pollution. A market mechanism will cut pollution in our economy at the least cost. There is widespread recognition of that and widespread support for that approach. Recently 13 prominent economists have said a market mechanism is the most efficient way. Industry associations, including the Business Council, have advocated that a market mechanism is the most efficient way of tackling climate change. Leaders from various religious faiths were in parliament a couple of weeks ago and advocated action on climate change. Former Liberal leaders from Malcolm Fraser through to Dr John Hewson through to the member for Wentworth all agree that a market based mechanism is the best way to tackle climate change. Finally, as the Treasurer averred to earlier, the Productivity Commission made it crystal clear in a report released last week that carbon pricing would deliver through a market mechanism any given reduction in pollution at the least cost.                 We were also recently reminded that none other than the opposition leader has also supported a market mechanism in various forms, either a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, at various points in time. But he subsequently sought to disown his own comments. Last week a journalist asked the Leader of the Opposition the following:                 Mr Abbott in 2009, the interview that was aired on Monday night, you said that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not do it with just a simple tax. How has your position on that changed now?                 The Leader of the Opposition responded as follows:                 I was asked if, if you wanted to put a price on carbon - and I didn't think we should put a price on carbon then _                 And the Leader of the Opposition says he does not now. The only trouble with that is that the Leader of the Opposition is on the record on multiple occasions in the past supporting a carbon price. Here are a few examples. In December 2008, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say in his Daily Telegraph blog:                 An emissions trading scheme probably is the best way to put a price on carbon _                 In July 2009, the Leader of the Opposition wrote the following:                 Still, a new tax would be the intelligent skeptic's way to deal with minimising emissions _                 One would not know who he was referring to as an intelligent sceptic. Again, in November 2009, he said on radio 2UE -                    The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                     Mr Speaker, we are on board with that proposition I think.                     Again, in November 2009, the Leader of the Opposition said on radio 2UE, 'You can't have a climate change policy without supporting an ETS at this time.'                 Not only is the Leader of the Opposition intent on spreading misinformation about the government's policy; he is now also spreading misinformation about his own - misrepresenting his own position, which is on the record from the past. We know how the Leader of the Opposition views himself on this issue: he is a self-confessed weathervane on climate change policy. His position has been a muddle for a period of time, but there are some things that are perfectly clear.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that of course I visited Malaysia several times in recent months and of course I can confirm that the arrangement between the prime ministers that was announced - that asylum seekers transferred from Australia to Malaysia will be treated with dignity and respect and in accordance with human rights standards - will be operationalised. I can also confirm that this is an arrangement which has been developed in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I can confirm that because it is the case.                     As I said, this arrangement, which has been developed in conjunction with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been consulted at every step of the way, will ensure that appropriate standards of care are in place. That is very important, because there are two alternative propositions before the House. I note the magical mystery tour by the honourable member, with the Leader of the Opposition, to Nauru at the weekend and I notice that some members opposite, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, have been trying to claim that the Nauru solution has the endorsement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on 27 May in relation to Nauru that it was auspiced under the United Nations. Senator Birmingham this week claimed that the Nauru centre was 'overseen and approved' by the UNHCR. Well, the UNHCR had a very funny way of showing it because it said this when the Nauru centre was closed:                 UNHCR had strong concerns about the Pacific solution _                 _ in our view, today's closure of the centre at Nauru signals the end of a difficult chapter in Australia's treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.                 It is easier to be more accurate when you are plagiarising than when you make it up as you go. This week, in response to claims from the opposition, the UNHCR said:                 UNHCR was not involved and, indeed, distanced itself from any role in overseeing or managing the processing facilities on Nauru under the Pacific Solution.                 I look forward to informing the House and further reporting to the House on the protections in place in relation to the arrangements with Malaysia. I am sure the honourable member for Cook will similarly update the House on his discussions with President Ahmadinejad and the protections that are in place with his transfer agreement with Iran.

  I thank the member for her question. I am asked about support for an action plan to deal with dangerous climate change. The fact is that in a country which has a great scientific tradition, producing leaders across a range of disciplines, scientists have the opportunity to provide input to the important public debates that we have about policy. One of the most important of those debates is the debate around the best way to tackle dangerous climate change. Despite what the opposition would have us believe, the facts around climate change are clear - global warming is a reality; it is being caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide; and the consequences of not acting are severe.                 I want to highlight an open letter from some 46 members of Australia's scientific community outlining the case for urgent action and condemning those who wish to muddy the waters by relying on unsupported and unscientific views of climate change sceptics. That letter is titled 'Climate change is real'. The signatories to the letter, some of our leading scientists representing a range of scientific fields in Australia's leading universities, are together calling for an end -                      These scientists call for an end to what they describe as the phoney public debate, and for an acceptance that 'climate change is real, we are causing it, and it is happening now'. The letter goes on to say:                 A vast number of scientists, engineers and visionary businessmen are boldly designing a future based on low-impact energy pathways _ a future in which substantial health gains can be achieved by eliminating fossil-fuel pollution _                 That is a vision that this government shares and supports. We know that by putting a price on carbon that will be paid by those who emit the most pollution, by providing Australian families with the opportunity to adjust to that and also by supporting low-emission technologies into the future, we will be taking the most effective measures that we can to deal with dangerous climate change. It is not only science that is speaking; it is business as well. We have leading business figures consistently saying yes to a price on carbon. When Gail Kelly, one of Australia's leading businesswomen, was asked whether she said yes to a price on carbon, she answered, 'Yes'. Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas, said:                 We can understand the logic on the carbon tax and why the government regards it as a necessity _                 In an open letter to the Prime Minister last month, AGL, BP Solar, Conergy, Siemens and Snowy Hydro, amongst others, said:                 A price on carbon _ is widely recognised as being the most efficient and effective way of reducing emissions to meet this target.                      The fact is that science and business are speaking together. The fact is the Liberals might not believe in climate change but they do believe in clawing back the support that will go to pensioners in this country as a consequence of our taking action on climate change. This is what is happening - the opposition leader, in a great tragedy of public debate in this country, refuses to acknowledge the legitimate point put by scientists that the most effective step we can take is to put a price on carbon and is willing to claw back the assistance that we will provide to pensioners at large.

  I thank the member for his question. As the member would be aware, we are in advanced discussions with Malaysia. Rather than, as we have seen from the opposition in the past, the member for Stirling going round and making things up, at the appropriate point he will be able himself to see all of the conditions applying to the transfer agreement with Malaysia. I would remind the member that the purpose of the transfer agreement with Malaysia is to break the people smugglers' business model.                      It is only by working through our region in a regional way through an agreement like the agreement we are discussing with Malaysia that we can break that model - as opposed to what the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesperson are recommending, which is a one-out action, not being part of a regional solution, not being connected to UNHCR and having the ultimate destination as Australia.                     We are determined to work through to a more effective approach to deal with people-smuggling.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Of course, I have always believed that we need to put a price on carbon and we will. I am reinforced in my belief about the need to put a price on carbon by the fact that so many people agree with me. Here on the Labor side we agree with pricing carbon. Many, many Australians, including eminent Australians who have come out today, are having their voices heard on pricing carbon. We have had Australians attend rallies about pricing carbon. I have had support from many different quarters on this. I would thank, for example, the member for Flinders -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about my views on pricing carbon, and I am reaffirming to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that I have always believed we needed to price carbon in order to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change. Of course, I am reinforced in this belief by the widespread community support for it. I am reinforced in this belief by support from unusual sources including the member for Flinders who has supported pricing carbon by saying:                 Perhaps the most important domestic policy was the decision of the Howard Government that Australia will implement a national carbon trading system.                 Or the support I have received from the member for North Sydney, and I thank him for it. He said:                 _ inevitably we'll have a price on carbon _ we'll have to.                 Or the support I have received from the member for Aston who said: 'The government's role should be to create the market environment that will lead to the outcomes sought either through putting a price on CO2 or other mechanisms.' Or the member for Moore; I thank him for his support. He said: 'If we don't price carbon both sides of politics will be guilty of putting up stupid feel good programs that are not cost effective.' Or the member for Wentworth; I thank him for his support for pricing carbon. He said:                 My views on climate change, the need for a carbon price, the fact that market-based mechanisms are the most efficient ways of cutting emissions, my views are the same today as they were when I was part of John Howard's Cabinet.                 And those views were held by the Howard government. I have to say, I even thank the Leader of the Opposition for his periodic support for pricing carbon because, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has been known to go out and advocate a carbon tax from time to time. He most particularly did so on 29 July 2009 when he said:                 If you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax?                 He went on to extol the merits of a carbon tax. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has had so many positions on pricing carbon that it led the member for Wentworth, in desperation, to describe him as a political weathervane. He needed to go out that day and check the political winds in order to work out whether or not he believed climate change was real or whether we should price carbon. As opposed to the weathervane politics that we see through the Leader of the Opposition -                      I am determined and the government is determined to get on with the job of pricing carbon. It is in the national interest and we will pursue that national interest. We will allow the Leader of the Opposition to get on with his stupid oppositional political games, working out what he believes in by checking the political winds. We will do the right thing for the nation.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Taking action on climate change now is very important for future generations. To mitigate the risk to our environment, our economy, and our society of the long-term effects of climate change, we have got to start the hard work of cutting pollution and driving investment in clean energy. As Australia is one of the most emissions intensive economies in the world, the task for us is more challenging than most other countries. That is why the government is pursuing a carbon price, because it is the lowest cost way for us to cut our pollution and, therefore, it is the lowest cost way of tackling climate change for Australian families and Australian industries.                 The revenue from a carbon price can also be used to provide assistance to households and to support jobs in the most affected industries. Those measures to assist families and support jobs are a key feature of the government's approach - an approach that is well known to the opposition. But that does not deter the Leader of the Opposition from his fear campaign, a campaign full of exaggeration, misinformation and misrepresentation.                 It is instructive to look at how extreme and shrill some of the Leader of the Opposition's statements have become. He stated, in the full knowledge of the government's commitment to assist pensioners and low- and middle-income households and that the price impacts will be modest, that 'the hit on Australians' cost of living is almost unimaginable'. He knows the government is committed to providing assistance to pensioners and low- and middle-income households, he knows the impact will be modest, but he misrepresents the position consistently.                 He has claimed, in the full knowledge that the government will be providing assistance to support jobs in the most affected industries, that whole manufacturing industries will be wiped off the map, that towns will be wiped off the map.                   The member for Gippsland                    then left the chamber.                     The Leader of the Opposition knows that across the coal industry the price per tonne of coal is modest indeed. At an example of $20 per tonne carbon price, the impact on the price per tonne of coal mined for methane emissions is around $1.60 per tonne. This does not prevent the Leader of the Opposition going to the Minerals Council of Australia meeting a week or two ago and claiming it would be the death and destruction of the coal industry - ridiculous hyperbole, increasingly shrill.                 It does not matter that the Productivity Commission does a report identifying 1,000 policies in the economies of seven of our trading partners; he still goes out and claims that Australia will be going it alone against the rest of the world - increasingly ridiculous claims. As we heard yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition in the past has strongly advocated that a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme is the best way to go. He said, 'If you want to put a price on carbon why not do it with a simple tax?' As a self-described weathervane, misrepresenting yourself as well as everyone else is now just a tool of the trade.

  I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I did see those statements by Jennie George. I believe that they were published yesterday. Of course, Jennie George was a great member of this place and someone who had devoted her life to representing working people, starting her life in the teachers union and then moving to the ACTU. When you look at Jennie George's letter, she was pointing to the circumstances of the steel industry. I certainly understand that the steel industry is under a great deal of pressure. It is under a great deal of pressure because of the transformation that we are seeing in the Australian economy. It is a transformation - with mineral prices and the resources industry where they are now and the growth that that industry is experiencing, the terms of trade that we see now, our dollar at a very high level and that level being sustained - that is putting pressure on industries like the steel industry. The pressure is on their shoulders right now; that pressure was on their shoulders last year. This is pressure on the steel industry as a result of the economic transformation in our economy. Of course we are concerned about these circumstances and have been having discussions and working with the steel industry on its future.                     I also understand, as we move to pricing carbon, that we will need to keep working with the steel industry. We want to see people having jobs in steel, and we will keep working productively with the steel industry as we design the carbon pricing scheme. The member for Gilmore has tried through the phrasing of her question to get some sense of division into it. If the member for Gilmore is concerned about questions of division she may want to direct her attention to another report yesterday, a report of a senior Liberal in the Sydney Morning Herald who said:                 You can't take money away from pensioners, it would kill us.                 The member for Gilmore might like to express her view on clawing money back from Australian pensioners -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member for Gilmore has asked me a question about the steel industry and job security and carbon pricing. At the end of the day, when we deal with carbon pricing and we deal with jobs for Australian workers, we have to come back to first principles about what will create the most prosperous clean energy economy we can have in the future. We on this side of the parliament believe as we create a clean energy economy that polluters should pay, not Australian families. We believe that money should go to support Australian families; you believe in taking it away from Australian families. We believe in protecting Australian jobs and seeing a future of prosperity with a clean energy economy; the Liberal Party has never believed in protecting Australian jobs. You cannot have concern about job security and be a supporter of Work Choices.                  The choices here are simple - we want to cut carbon pollution; you would see it rise. We want polluters to pay; you would see families pay. We want to give money to Australian families; you want to take it from them. We want to protect Australian jobs; you have never shown the slightest concern for job security. The member for Gilmore might want to reflect on that when she considers the future for Australian workers.

  I thank my friend and colleague the member for Blair for his question. I can advise him that there would be every prospect of countries that do proceed with carbon pricing retaliating against Australian exporters if we sought to have a free ride into their markets at the expense of their industries. Any delay would create a new excuse for protectionism to take hold in our export markets, which would be very damaging to our exporters. A recently released Productivity Commission report finds that Australia's top five trading partners - China, Japan, the United States, Korea and India - have implemented carbon pricing in one form or another at the national, state or city level. Far from going it alone, it is clear that Australia is around the middle of the pack in our efforts to put a price on carbon.                  I am asked by the member for Blair about support for a carbon price. We have seen in the newspapers today support for pricing carbon from leading Australians including Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, Fiona Stanley and Patrick McGorry - I understand that the coalition accepts that Patrick McGorry is a great Australian, as are Dr Fiona Stanley and Ian Kiernan, amongst others. There is another contributor to this debate about putting a price on carbon, and that other contributor has had this to say, sensibly:                 ... a new tax would be the intelligent sceptic's way to deal with minimising emissions ...                     Dr EMERSON:                     Who said that? That is a good question. Who said a new tax would be an intelligent sceptic's way to deal with minimising emissions? I do not think it could be the member for Wentworth because he is not a sceptic and he is intelligent. I do not think it could be the member for Flinders because he is not a sceptic and he is intelligent. I do not think it could be the member for Dickson because he is a sceptic - well, I will move on.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I am responding to that part of the question which asked, 'Will the minister inform the House of recent support for a carbon tax and what is the government's response?' There has been recent support for a carbon tax by an intelligent sceptic. We know he is a sceptic because he said, 'I'm not sure about carbon dioxide being the villain that it is made out to be; the science is not settled.' So who is this self-professed intelligent sceptic? None other than the Leader of the Opposition. Come on, join us! The opposition leader should join us because he is an intelligent sceptic and he is on the record. It is written down so it is the gospel truth, not in the heat of the moment, and it must be true. What words is he speaking? He is speaking the words of a cheapjack opportunist. From this intelligent sceptic we have another commitment - that is, he will claw back any pension increases. His frontbench is right:                 You can't take money away from pensioners, it would kill us.                 On 1 July 2012 it will be the opportunist day of reckoning when the Leader of the Opposition seeks to take money back from pensioners. We will implement a carbon tax. We will put a price on carbon because it is the right thing to do for Australia and it is the right thing to do for the environment. The intelligent sceptic over there ought to get on board.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. He has once again disappointed the Leader of the House, but one of these days I am sure he will make the Leader of the House's day by asking him a question on infrastructure. In answer to the Leader of the National Party's question, we are determined to work with coal as we are determined to work with business generally in order to get the design of carbon pricing right. We will be working to ensure that we are protecting Australian jobs. We are cutting carbon pollution. We are assisting Australian families. We are funding programs that get us ready for the clean energy economy of the future and that tackle climate change.                 The Leader of the National Party asks me on these debates about pricing carbon, 'Who takes what position in these debates?' I say to the Leader of the National Party that perhaps he might want to explain to me who the senior Liberal was who said:                 You can't take money away from pensioners, it would kill us.                 The Leader of the National Party says that he is interested in Australian jobs and the future of the coal industry -                      I understand that members of the opposition frontbench will do anything to distract Australians from the very simple truth behind this carbon pricing debate. And the very simple truth behind this carbon pricing debate is that I believe climate change is real; the Leader of the Opposition does not. I believe we have to cut carbon pollution; the Leader of the Opposition has plans to see carbon pollution rise. I believe big polluters should pay; the Leader of the Opposition wants to take funds from Australian families and give them to big polluters. I believe Australian families and pensioners should be assisted; the Leader of the Opposition wants to claw that assistance away from pensioners and Australian families - take money away from people who are already challenged by cost-of-living pressures. I want to protect Australian jobs, which is why the government have a proud record of supporting Australian employment, including during the global financial crisis and continuing with that support to the present day with 750,000 jobs created so far and half a million more to be created in the two years to come. The Leader of the Opposition literally slept through the key measures to support Australian jobs during the days of the global financial crisis. He literally could not be bothered getting out of bed to protect the Australian jobs. Through their interjections and bellowing, through their belief that if you shout loud enough someone will believe you, I understand that the Leader of the Opposition just wants to distract from all of this. But the truth could not be clearer. We will put a price on carbon pollution. We will put it on the big polluters. We will provide assistance to Australian families. We will protect Australian jobs. And we will tackle climate change.

  I thank the member for his question. I am regretting that I am not in possession of his well-known sign with the '10' on it to judge contributions to the parliament because I think I would be holding it up in view of that question. But, yes, I am very well aware of the parliamentary report that he speaks of. I am very well aware that he led the inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin. I am very well aware of the hard work that went in from all members of the committee across all political parties in the parliament to look at what is a very important issue for the nation. I thank all of them for the work that they have done in compiling this report.                  As the member for New England would be aware, the recommendations are being taken very seriously by the government and more broadly. As the member for New England would be aware, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is seriously considering the work that has been put together by the committee. The government are seriously considering the work. The government's response to the interim findings was to act on a number of issues to which the committee drew attention - for example, moving to address the taxation issues that were inhibiting infrastructure investment, introducing smaller rolling tenders for water buyback to allow a more modest presence in the water market, beginning consultation with stakeholders around a new more flexible approach to support rationalisation of irrigation areas and committing $10 million for the states and the community to conduct feasibility assessments into environmental works and measures that can help to bridge the gap. These were important findings and in our interim response we have addressed those important findings.                  The government will now seriously consider the rest of the committee's recommendations and work, and respond in due course. But I am pleased to see that, at this stage, the member has led a bipartisan approach to what is a pressing issue facing the nation. Permanent and sustainable reform has eluded past governments; I am determined that it will not elude this parliament and this government. This is the time to ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin has the policies for the future that will see a healthy river and sustainable communities, and growing and food security. We will be working with the member for New England and broadly with the committee members and parliamentary members on achieving just that.                     I was referring to a document about the committee's findings. Sections of the document are confidential.                 The established practices of the House are to inquire of a minister whether they were reading from a document. They are then asked whether the document was confidential or not. The fact that we truncated that process seems to have upset people. We will just have to wear that at this stage. The member for Chisholm has the call.

  As the parliament meets today there are workers who are rallying in New South Wales against a workplace relations assault by the Liberal Party. They are teachers, they are nurses, they are firefighters - they are workers who keep the public services alive in New South Wales. And from the reaction to this question it is clear that the Liberal and National parties in this parliament hold such working people in complete contempt - teachers, nurses, firefighters. They hold them and their workplace relations rights in complete contempt. Of course, that contemptuous attitude towards the rights of working people is something that is very familiar to the Australian community, because it was shown to the Australian people by the Liberal Party in office when it brought Work Choices to this country. I, as the relevant minister, and the Labor government were determined to get rid of Work Choices because it was a cost-of-living dagger to the heart of working Australian families: hardworking people whose job security was attacked, hardworking people whose basic pay and conditions were attacked and hardworking people who had their job security lessened by the removal of unfair dismissal rights.                  We have heard a bit today from the Liberal Party about the question of job security for working people. Their track record in government was they could not care less; they wanted working people to be sacked more easily. Let us remind ourselves what Work Choices did to Australian working people through Australian workplace agreements.                     I move:                 That the member for Cowper be excused from the service of the House.                  Question put.                 The House divided. [14:57]                 (The Speaker - Mr Harry Jenkins)                 Question agreed to.                     I was responding to a question by the member for Chisholm. The member for Chisholm asked me about industrial relations arrangements and about Work Choices and I was reminding the House that under Work Choices over two-thirds of Australian workplace agreements removed penalty rates, 31 per cent took away rest breaks, nearly half took away overtime loadings and 63 per cent removed incentive based payments and bonuses. That is, they took away the kinds of payments that working people rely on to do things like pay the mortgage and pay the bills.                  Today in New South Wales we are seeing the return of Work Choices. It is back to take it or leave it. It is back to no negotiation, no bargaining, no independent umpire. In fact, it is back as if 100 years of Labor reform of workplace relations had not happened. These changes are targeted at Australians who are very hard working and who deserve to be treated with respect - like teachers, like nurses, like firefighters. As this action happens today and as we see this conduct by the New South Wales Liberal government, it reminds Australians that, whatever the Liberal party says to you before an election, after the election it is back to workplace relations reform and back to Work Choices. This is a living example for Australians -                      The clear example we have today is of the deep love and affection of the Liberal Party of Australia for Work Choices.                     It is unacceptable to working Australians, it is unacceptable to the people of New South Wales and it is unacceptable to this Labor government. It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition has always across his political life been such a strong supporter of workplace relations reform and taking away basic pay and entitlements from working Australians. Unless he dissociates himself from Barry O'Farrell it will be on display again.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question about jobs. As I said in this House yesterday, nothing is more fundamental to those of us on this side of the House than supporting jobs. We know that it is possible to have a substantial reduction in carbon pollution and still have strong employment growth. We know that because all the credible analysis shows that that is the case: the credible analysis that has come through Stern, through Garnaut and through the Treasury. It tells us that we as a nation can make substantial reductions in carbon pollution and support strong employment outcomes.                 I would have to go away and check the quote that the shadow Treasurer used, but I know that the member for Throsby is a very strong supporter of jobs, just like everybody behind me here. When jobs were threatened in the global recession we were there for Australians. Those opposite were not. I will never forget the then Leader of the Opposition saying that stimulus would not create a single job. But stimulus saved Australia and saved a whole lot of small businesses right around this country. We put in place investment.                 What drives everybody on this side of the House is jobs. And what drives everybody on this side of the House is making sure we put in place the correct economic settings so that we are a competitive economy for the future. We on this side of the House understand the need to take the tough decisions to set us up for the future, to make sure we do generate the jobs for the future in a clean energy economy.                     No first-world, first-grade economy can maintain that position without investing in clean energy. We on this side of the House understand that. We on this side of the House also understand that there will be a need for transitional assistance in energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries, and we have made that commitment very clear. But those on the other side of the House simply have a 'subsidise polluters' policy that will put up taxes for all Australians. They have no plans to either assist industry or to assist households. The hypocrisy of their coming into this House and pretending they care about jobs. I well remember the scare campaign that was waged by the shadow Treasurer -                      It is a question about jobs. During the global financial crisis the shadow Treasurer said there would be 300,000 jobs lost in Australia. They went right around the country talking down our economy -                      just as they are talking down our economy today. But because we on this side of the House understand the importance of jobs and because we understand the importance of future prosperity we will put in place the assistance for the types of industries that are affected.                     Because we understand the importance of jobs. Those opposite do not understand the importance of jobs. They stood for Work Choices - less security for Australian workers. They do not stand for jobs. We on this side of the House stand here proudly supporting jobs, future prosperity and a clean energy future for the jobs of the future.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question because he, like so many on this side of the House, has been a fighter for the rights of people at work, unlike those on the other side who would dismantle those rights. I am asked the question about what we have done by way of action to protect those rights. The most important thing we did on coming to office was to abolish Work Choices. In its place we established Fair Work Australia. Fair Work Australia was based around the fundamental principles of the right to collective bargaining, the requirement for the parties to bargain in good faith, and for there to be an ability to go to an independent umpire if there was an issue to be resolved.                     How has this benefited the Australian economy? I think it is important, given the last question in which the other side asked about job losses, because that is exactly what they said would happen when we introduced Fair Work Australia: jobs would be lost, industrial disputes would go up, inflation would go through the roof. What has been the evidence of that in the time since we abolished Work Choices and established Fair Work Australia? There have been 740,000 jobs created; industrial disputes are now lower than when you left office; inflation is still under control, despite an economy growing stronger than the rest of the world; and there has been significant wages growth. Why would you want to get rid of a system like that?                 But I am asked about the threats to it, Mr Speaker. Well, I will tell you what the threats are. The threats are that the Liberal Party gets re-elected to office. What the Liberal Party did before the last election was say - and there we have the Leader of the Opposition; we remember him when he said it - 'No return to Work Choices; it's dead, buried, cremated.' We saw Senator Abetz for three days in the campaign when he admitted that there would be tweaking to the industrial relations system. We all know what 'tweaking' is because it was defined. It is the backdoor method to regulating the wages system. We never saw Senator Abetz in the rest of the campaign. He was shut up.                 If anyone wants to know what tweaking means, they need only look at what the New South Wales government is doing in relation to public servants. They are going to introduce legislation that declares by regulation the conditions of employment for nurses, teachers, firefighters and state public servants; they are doing this by regulation. In effect, what they are doing is stripping away the two fundamentals that we created. They are stripping away the entitlement to good-faith bargaining and they are stripping away access to the independent umpire. The reason they are doing it is that it is in the Liberal DNA. They cannot help themselves. They have never understood the importance of getting encouragement and participation in the workplace to lift productivity to underpin the prosperity of this nation. We on this side of the House do understand that, and that is why we will fight for the rights of workers to ensure that they benefit but the nation benefits as well. The only threat to it is the election of a Liberal government. Don't make that choice.

  I do thank the member for Hume for that very important question, because it is the case that there have been in recent years very substantial increases in electricity prices. What has driven that increase in electricity prices has been a lack of investment in the distribution and the network. And, of course, the expert who told us all of that is the shadow minister over there. What he said just before the last election would happen has in fact happened, because there has been very substantial underinvestment in the electricity distribution system, and the consequence of that, unfortunately, is price rises across a number of states. The regulator has said in recent times that there will be further increases and that they have absolutely nothing to do with a carbon price. They come from that lack of investment and the need for continued investment in the system.                 Those opposite can go out there and run their scare campaigns and pretend that it is somehow the fault of the government. It simply does not wash. There is a very substantial problem and we do need to get more investment into this sector. There is no doubt about that because we need the energy security that a strong economy requires, and that is going to happen. What we do know - and what those over there are running a scare campaign on and in denial about - is that if there is not a carbon price then prices will go up even higher because there will not be the investment that is required. This is what the Australian Energy Market Commission itself said. The member for Hume referred to what they were saying, and they have said this: 'Financing risk associated with uncertainty around the carbon price will contribute to future price rises.'                 So the member has performed an own goal here. That is what they have said about the future of prices. That is why we do need to put a price on carbon to drive the investment in electricity. But what we will do, and what those opposite will not do, is assist families affected by those price increases. What they are going to do is tax families, pay polluters and not give anybody any assistance when it comes to their electricity bill. That is the hypocrisy of those opposite - they give no assistance to anyone who is affected by price increases and frustrate a price on carbon, the effect of which is to further increase electricity prices. The hypocrisy of those opposite is just incredible.                 We know they are split into a couple of camps. We have the member for Wentworth, who actually believes in a market price on carbon and believes in climate change. That is camp No. 1. We have camp No.2 from the Leader of the Opposition. He is a complete denier and, of course, a sceptic. But we now have another camp. We have the shadow Treasurer. He is in the turncoat camp. This is what he has had to say about a price on carbon -                      I am arguing the case for a carbon price which is the least costly, most efficient way of pricing carbon and the best way to ensure that we have a prosperous economy. That is what I am arguing and that was once argued by the shadow Treasurer. Only last year he said:                 I was acting industry minister in 2002 when Peter Costello, David Kemp and I argued _ in the Howard cabinet that we should have an ETS.                     That is what he said only a year ago.                     Mr Speaker, we are seeing a scare campaign from those opposite. The fact is that we on this side of the House will put the national interest before political interest.

  I thank the member for Newcastle for that question. This is an issue that I am sure both sides of parliament agree on. Too many Australians either are born with hearing loss or develop hearing loss during the course of their lives. About 160,000 Australians are unable to work because of their condition and the economic cost of this is estimated to be around $11 billion a year. With an ageing population and increasing exposure to damaging noise levels in our everyday lives that problem is expected to increase. It is with great pleasure that I report to the House today about a new invention, another terrific Australian invention in this area.                  Australia has been at the forefront of research and development in this area for many years, and all Australians are proud of the Cochlear implant that is an Australian invention. We are recognised around the world for the Cochlear implant. It has brought the gift of sound into the lives of many tens of thousands of Australian children. It is done at an increasingly early age because we know that the development of language skills is stronger and much better if we are able to get children hearing from a much earlier age. The neural pathways are laid down in the brain and children learn to speak and to hear much better.                  I am very pleased to inform the House today about another very important advance in this area made by Australian researchers to improve the use of Cochlear implants and to judge at a much earlier age whether babies need a hearing aid, whether it is properly fitted and working or whether they perhaps need a Cochlear implant. This new invention produced by Australian Hearing in their laboratories with the help of the HEARing Cooperative Research Centre is trademarked as HEARLab.                 HEARLab is about the size of a briefcase and it works by putting little sensors on the skull of a baby. By applying those sensors to the baby's cranium, scientists are able to measure whether the sounds that are being played through the machine are registering in the baby's mind. It is very important because when you are fitting a hearing aid you cannot ask a baby: 'Can you hear that? Is it loud enough? Are you missing some sounds or are you picking them all up?' It is a terrific Australian advance to have this device, which registers whether the baby is picking up those sounds and, if the baby is not picking up those sounds, means being able to amend the hearing aid so the baby can hear or to recognise that a Cochlear implant would be more appropriate for that child. Knowing that from an early age allows us to treat a hearing impaired baby properly. It means that the baby will learn to differentiate sounds much earlier, learn to hear better and learn to speak much better than if we wait even six months or even a year or two. It is an absolutely fundamental breakthrough that will not just be terrific for Australian babies but also be applied to other people who cannot tell an audiologist whether their hearing aid is working appropriately - for example, someone who has been the victim of a stroke, who will need help with their hearing aid but cannot express whether what they are hearing is registering properly. It builds on the terrific extra resources that will be available for early intervention for children with a hearing impairment that were previously announced by this government. I think all members are proud of this new Australian invention that will make a huge difference to the lives of Australian babies and babies around the world.

  I thank the member for his question. We know from the Productivity Commission report that putting a price on carbon is the least cost, most effective way to put that price in place. Of course, those opposite have an entirely different approach. They want to give subsidies to polluters, jacking up taxes for everybody and providing no assistance to households whatsoever.                 These types of questions will continue as the opposition runs its baseless scare campaign, as it will all the way through, but this government will not be deterred from putting in place a price on carbon. A price on carbon is absolutely essential for future growth in our economy. We know from the modelling that we can substantially reduce carbon pollution and still have strong economic growth, still have strong income growth and still have strong jobs growth. We know that the cost of not acting is far higher than the cost of acting. Those opposite are proposing that we delay for longer, and all that will mean is that harsher action will be required, with an impact on businesses later on.                 We as an economy have to make the transition. If we wish to be a first-rate, First World economy that generates prosperity and that generates jobs, then we have to invest in and drive a clean energy economy. We need to send the signal for investment into clean energy. I know that is not understood by those opposite. It used to be understood by some, but it is not understood by the deniers that are now running the modern Liberal Party and the turncoats that have joined them - the turncoat over there, the shadow Treasurer. I did not get to give the rest of the quote from the shadow Treasurer before, but this is what the shadow Treasurer had to say only last year -                    The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                     I was arguing the case for a carbon price, something that was believed in by some of those opposite only a short time ago. The shadow Treasurer had this to say only last year:                   I believe the market mechanism is the best way to price a commodity. I am a true believer in markets.                 That was only last year, to Lenore Taylor and David Uren. That is what the shadow Treasurer said then, but he has done a lot more. He said this on ABC Radio National on 6 March:                   We were the initiators of an emissions trading scheme. We went to the last election promising to introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2011-12. We put the fundamentals in place.                     That is why I describe him as a turncoat. He used to have some principles and he no longer has them.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question. As a South Australian he is all too aware of the challenges that have been faced by the Murray-Darling for so long. We have a river system that was run as though it would respect state boundaries. You cannot have a situation where an environmental asset and an asset that has such a value to communities up and down the basin is managed in a way that pretends that state boundaries matter. You cannot have one set of rules in the north of the basin and presume a different set of rules in the south will work. That was understood by former Prime Minister John Howard. It was even understood by the member for Wentworth. The states are now working in a more cooperative way. In fact the only example that we can now find of where there is one set of messages in the north of the basin and another set of messages in the south is the way the coalition are choosing to manage this issue.                 We heard earlier in question time today about an inquiry that was well received, an inquiry chaired by the member for New England, in which all sides of politics on the committee were able to agree in a unanimous report. Members might not be aware of the inquiry that was originally called for by Senator Barnaby Joyce in the Senate. So proud were the opposition of the outcomes of that, it was released with great fanfare at four o'clock on Friday afternoon last week. When it was first called for Senator Joyce said:                 It's very important now, while I have an inquiry examining the Water Act, that changes to the Water Act take place so as to change the outcome.                 Make no mistake, the reason Senator Joyce wanted to call for the Water Act to be opened up was to stop the reform. It was as simple as that. He knew full well that the moment you opened up the Water Act the Murray-Darling Basin Authority could not continue with its current work and it would have to pause the reform. That was why they wanted to open up the act. It is an act that was well drafted by the member for Wentworth when he held this portfolio. It is an act that plenty of members of the coalition have said that they were quite proud of and quite happy with. But Senator Joyce continues to go up and down irrigation communities calling for the Water Act to be opened up.                 We now have South Australian members of parliament who have decided that they disagree, and disagree strongly, with what Senator Joyce is saying to the irrigation communities. They have decided to send their messages out in a way that Senator Joyce will never find. They have decided to use Twitter and by using Twitter, of course using internet technology rather than carrier pigeon, Barnaby will never know. We had Senator Birmingham tweeting: 'In response to the inquiry I suspect it will be of little consequence. What matters more is what is in the draft Basin Plan.'                 But I think nothing beats the rejection of Senator Joyce and the coalition dominated inquiry in the Senate, and nothing beats the response that was put forward by the member for Mayo, who was briefly in the chamber earlier today. The member for Mayo said: 'It's a Senate committee report. If a tree falls in the forest ...' That was his tweet. The tweet from the member for Mayo was saying, 'Well, we can effectively ignore.' What the coalition have to realise on this is that the days of being able to run one set of messages in the north of the basin and a different set of messages at the South Australian end all come to an end when we vote in this chamber.                 At the beginning of next year there will be a Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It will have been given to us by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, it will have gone to the ministerial council and it will come to this chamber for a vote. We will finally find out whether or not the coalition is willing to see basin reform once and for all.

  I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will pursue policies in the national interest. It is in this nation's interests and in the interests of our region to have a regional solution to people smuggling and to be breaking the people smugglers' business model, and to that end we will send clearly to the people smugglers and to the people who risk their lives in boats and pay their money to people smugglers the message that they should not get on that boat, they should not pay their money, because if they do they are at risk of being transferred to Malaysia and ending up at the back of the queue. That is the strongest possible message that we can send as a disincentive to people to pay people smugglers and risk their lives.                  We are determined to work through a regional solution. That is why we went to Bali and worked with nations in our region for the Bali framework. The Bali framework of course auspices nations to work on bilateral arrangements like transfer agreements, and that is what we have been doing with Malaysia.                  I know the Leader of the Opposition after his recent visit to Nauru is advocating a detention facility on Nauru. In my view this is a weaker solution to the problem of people smuggling. It is a solution that is one-out, not part of a regional process. It would be sending a message to asylum seekers that they can still get to Australia but there will be some delay, because that is what happened when Nauru was last in operation - the majority of people found to be refugees were resettled here in Australia. I am determined that we send a tougher message than that, a stronger message than that, and we will.

  I thank the Chief Government Whip, who represents the Hunter region in this parliament, for his question. As many members of parliament would know and as Australians around the nation have been seeing through the pictures on their TV screens and the reports in the newspapers, there are communities in the Hunter region and on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales that have been seriously affected by floods. Yesterday afternoon the New South Wales government declared natural disaster zones in the local government areas of Bellingen, Clarence Valley, Kempsey and the Upper Hunter. New South Wales authorities estimate that over 3,000 people are currently affected by evacuation orders. The townships of Manning Point, Harrington and Crowdy Head are isolated, and that isolation is expected to last three to four days, with a further 850 people affected. The SES have been doing the great work that they do when we face natural disasters. They have received almost 1,500 requests for assistance since Sunday. They have been very busy indeed, and we thank them for their work.                 Sixteen schools and a number of roads are closed. I understand conditions are expected to worsen over the coming period. Of course, the federal government, working with the New South Wales government, through our emergency management personnel, who do such a great job, is closely monitoring the situation. The government is providing assistance to individuals, businesses and primary producers who have been affected by the severe weather. Together with state authorities, we are acting quickly to provide that assistance. Individuals and families whose homes and essential household items have been damaged or destroyed will be able to apply for personal hardship and distress grants to help them with emergency food and clothing and to restore housing. We want people to be able to get that assistance very quickly.                 We are making available concessional interest rate loans of up to $130,000 for small businesses and primary producers and up to $25,000 for voluntary, non-profit organisations to ensure that they can get back up and running. Transport freight subsidies of up to 50 per cent will assist hard-hit primary producers with moving livestock and fodder. Funding will also be provided to restore and replace essential public assets such as roads, bridges and schools in affected areas. As always, we stand ready to provide further assistance should it be necessary.                 The people in these regions in New South Wales are the most recent Australians to be hit by natural disaster during the course of this year. This is a year in which Australians around the nation and most particularly in Queensland have suffered the full force of nature's might. We have clear arrangements for working with state governments and local governments in such emergency situations, and those arrangements are working to provide emergency relief right now. My thanks go to all of the hardworking Australians, including volunteers, who are helping their fellow Australians during this time of need. I am sure we all well and truly wish for the weather to give us some respite and that the communities affected are back up on their feet as quickly as possible.

  I did not bring every Australian history book with me to parliament but what I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that yes - and I would have assumed he also noted this - I can confirm that since the election last year the government have been functioning in a circumstance of minority government. In the circumstances where we function in the House of Representatives as a minority government, I view it as likely from time to time that motions will be carried by the House of Representatives expressing a view about issues. That is appropriate for parliamentarians to do and they will do it. But anybody who knows anything about the Westminster system and the way in which government works in this country also knows that it falls to executive government to make important policy choices and decisions on behalf of the nation - and I have.                 I have made an important policy decision on behalf of the nation. That policy decision is that we should do everything we can to break the people smugglers' business model. We can best do that - indeed, we can truly only do that - by working for a regional solution with countries in our region. We are doing so. We did that through the Bali framework earlier this year. Now under the auspices of that framework we are in advanced negotiations with Malaysia about a transfer agreement which would send the hardest possible message we can to people smugglers and asylum seekers to not get on a boat. I am determined to send the toughest message we can that people should not get on boats. I do not want to see people smugglers profit. I do not want to see people risk their lives at sea.                     On a point of order, Mr Speaker: my question was not about the government's policy; it was about whether the government was going to defy the express will of this parliament. I ask the Prime Minister to be directly relevant to the question.                     I am determined that we will pursue the agreement with Malaysia. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I am finding his sense of high dudgeon very interesting indeed. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition could not come into this parliament with a motion to support his Nauru solution, because that motion would fail in this House of Representatives and would be very likely to fail in the Senate too. So I am presuming what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is that no-one should take any further action to deal with people smuggling. If that is the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition - that no-one should take any further action to deal with people smuggling - I respectfully disagree. We will be taking the toughest possible further action to deal with people smuggling. I will allow the Leader of the Opposition to be stuck in a welter of inaction if that is where he would prefer to be.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. The government plans to introduce a carbon price because it will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy in the future. Importantly, it will do so at least cost to our economy, to businesses and to households. On this point, this morning the Prime Minister and I received letters from an international group, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change. That group comprises 72 members with assets under management of about $8.8 trillion -                      something the coalition seems to believe to be trivial. The group advises its members on investment risks and opportunities with respect to climate change. In their correspondence, the group had this to say:                  Evidence from leading economists including Sir Nicholas Stern and your own Professor Ross Garnaut, have clearly articulated the potential costs of inaction and the economic case for reducing emissions to avoid dangerous climate change. As whole of economy investors, this is evidence we must respond to.                 The correspondence goes on to advocate that a market mechanism which prices carbon is the least cost way to cut pollution levels. Support for a market mechanism is consistent with the views of senior market economists, with leading business groups and with the findings, a week ago, of the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission said:                 _ the consistent finding from this study is that much lower-cost abatement could be achieved through broad, explicit carbon pricing approaches, irrespective of the policy settings in competitor economies.                 That is a clear and unequivocal finding that a market mechanism is the cheapest, lowest cost and most efficient way for us to be reducing our pollution levels and driving investment in clean energy.                 From a different part of the debate, today the chief executive officer of the Victorian Council of Social Services, Cath Smith, said:                 It is time for Australia to adopt a price on carbon. It is clear that this is the most effective, efficient and fair option on the table to both tackle climate change and put the onus onto our biggest polluters and energy users to change their behaviour, while delivering compensation to people most at risk of disadvantage.                 The conclusion from all of the commentary is very clear - that a carbon price is the fairest, the cheapest and the most effective way to cut our pollution at the least cost to our economy.                 The issue of 'least cost to the economy' translates to 'least cost to households' and 'least cost across the economy to businesses'. A carbon price also generates revenue to support households as well as businesses. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he supports a subsidy-for-polluters policy paid for out of taxpayers' money. The Leader of the Opposition has also made it absolutely clear that he would remove any assistance provided by government to pensioners and to households - that is, he is going to claw back the pension increases, he is going to claw back increases in family assistance and he is going to claw back any other options to deliver that assistance - in the form of tax cuts, for example. You should recognise that households deserve the assistance the government is indicating it will provide and that you must not claw it back from them.

  I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she may want to refer to some of the books that describe our system of government. That will give her the answer to her question. Executive government takes policy decisions and we have. In respect of parliamentary consideration of matters involving asylum seeker and refugee policy, I think it is very important that, in answering the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, we are very clear about the parliamentary processes to date. The opposition brought to the parliament a motion to endorse its Nauru solution. It was not carried by the parliament, and indeed the opposition needed to pair out the members for Pearce and McMillan because it was unable to get two of its own members to walk into the parliament and support its motion. So its motion failed and it was not supported by two members of the opposition. The members for Pearce and Macmillan did not want to support it and so they were the subject of pairs. The Nauru solution, or so-called solution, as put by the opposition -                      I could not have been asked a broader question about democratic processes and I am answering that question. I am describing what happened with the Nauru motion because I am seriously going to ask the Leader of the Opposition: is he putting to this parliament and to the Australian people that if he were Prime Minister and his Nauru motion failed to get the support of this House, as it has, he would not proceed with his so-called Nauru solution? If that is the position of the Leader of the Opposition then I presume today he is saying to the Australian people that he has no policy and no plan on how to deal with people smuggling, because this House of parliament has rejected a motion containing his so-called Nauru solution. So now, arising out of today's questions in question time, we can clarify for the Australian people that the Leader of the Opposition proposes to do absolutely nothing about people smuggling.                     I am determined, on the other hand, to send the strongest possible message to people smugglers and to asylum seekers not to get on boats. And we will continue to pursue that policy and that agreement with Malaysia, as I take it now that we are the only political party in this parliament with a positive plan to take further action against people smuggling.

  I see that the Leader of the Opposition is continuing to pursue the stunt he started yesterday. National leadership requires you to deliver policies for the nation's future that are of some complexity. Certainly, carbon pricing is a complex policy, but it is in the nation's interest and I will pursue that policy. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, he is not only incapable of generating an idea for the nation's future, he is not only incapable of delivering a complex reform; he has actually proved incapable, over the last 24 hours, of pulling a stunt. He cannot even competently pull a stunt. He was out there saying he was going to have a simultaneous vote in the House of Representatives and the Senate at 10 am yesterday. No-one obviously told him that that was not possible because parliament was not sitting at that time; the House was not sitting. He did not go to his shadow cabinet, because presumably there may have been someone there with the wit to say that this was a particularly dumb stunt. Perhaps more important than any other point, this would cost taxpayers $80 million and the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he would not abide by the result in any event - $80 million to be wasted and he would not even abide by the result. I think Australians would be more concerned -                      And why is the Leader of the Opposition running away from the obligations of national leadership, which require us to put policies before the Australian people and to change the nation so that we are best prepared for the nation's future? That is, the obligation of national leadership requires us to tackle climate change in the cheapest way possible, and that is by pricing carbon.  This stunt which the Leader of the Opposition is pursuing today is an $80 million stunt, where he has said he would not even abide by the result. I believe Australians would be particularly disturbed to hear that what the Leader of the Opposition would prefer to do with $80 million - he does not want to put it into schools; he does not want to put it into hospitals; he does not want to put it into policies to assist older Australians - is put it into a political  stunt because, as usual, he is all about his political interests, not about the national interest. Once again, what we seeing on display in the parliament today is all opposition, no leader.

  I thank the member for Banks for his very good question to me as Leader of the House.                     He is aware that we have passed some 137 pieces of legislation through this House since the Prime Minister formed government after the August election last year. At the same time as we have done that, we have put in place, via parliamentary reform, opportunities for private members to move motions and move bills before the House and have them considered in an orderly way and have them voted upon in an orderly way by this parliament. Everyone is aware of what the processes are before this parliament - everyone except, it would appear, the Leader of the Opposition.                 I was indeed surprised to read in yesterday's Daily Telegraph that a bill would be introduced at 10 am yesterday here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate for a plebiscite - that we would move away from the parliament determining what legislation should be carried and we would move towards a plebiscite. I was particularly surprised -                      It goes to the debate of issues, which is the same as the question and the supplementary question asked by the Leader of the Opposition.                  We know that the Leader of the Opposition did not consult his frontbench on the stunt that he suggested yesterday. Indeed, he would have been the only person in the parliament if he had been here at 10 am yesterday. The fact is that this bill is just another stunt. It still has not been introduced into the Senate and there has been no debate about it in the House of Representatives, because so lacking in detail are the opposition that they could not even get their act together to put the bill on notice last Thursday.                 We know that true conservatives have rejected this approach. True conservatives, who have respect for parliamentary institutions, have rejected it. Indeed, John Howard - and the Leader of the Opposition has described himself as the 'political love child' of John Howard and the raiser of the point of order, Bronwyn Bishop - had this to say:                 _ in any one year you could have 40 or 50 contentious issues and the only way that democracy can work in an orderly fashion is to have the sort of electoral process we have. _ I don't think you can run it any other way.                 Rejected. The idea is rejected by some of those opposite and it is rejected by the member for New England, who said that it was just another political stunt. It is rejected by Senator Fielding, who said today, 'It is a political stunt.' But that is all we see day after day after day in this parliament - no respect for parliamentary institutions. The Leader of the Opposition has robbed parliament of some 124 questions by his suspensions of standing orders, and in about half an hour we will probably have yet another suspension of standing orders. But, as the Leader of the Opposition put it himself on 21 June 2006:                 Disrupting the House is not a sign of a disciplined opposition; disrupting the House is a sign of a desperate opposition.                 Well, he got that right, because what we are living through is the longest dummy spit in Australian political history.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I understand that in communities around the country there is of course concern and anxiety as our nation faces this big reform. That is to be expected. There has been concern and anxiety before major reforms in the past in this nation - for example, floating the dollar, reducing tariffs. These big reforms do cause anxiety but they are also the author of today's prosperity. The member who asked me the question represents in this parliament a tremendously vibrant place on the nation's map with the benefits of the resources boom showing in the communities that he represents, and those waves of contemporary prosperity have been built on the basis of reforms past.                 The best thing that the member for Dawson can do, and the best thing that this national parliament can do, for the people that he represents is to seize and address the challenges of the future, like climate change. The most efficient way of tackling climate change is to price carbon. To reject that is to reject the economic advice from all over this nation and around the world. The best way is to get big polluters to pay so that they reduce the amount of carbon pollution they produce and we then use that revenue to assist families in Dawson, to protect jobs and to tackle climate change.                     I say to the member for Dawson, who asked the question: the best way of cutting carbon pollution is to price carbon. The member for Dawson may want to talk to his constituents about whether they would prefer a scheme where they, the families of Dawson, pay and the money is used to give to big polluters. Before the member for Dawson too forcefully endorses the stunt of the Leader of the Opposition, he may want to go and speak to families in his electorate as to whether they think $80 million would be best spent on a political stunt or $80 million would be best spent on schools and hospitals and assistance for older Australians.                 I am sure the member for Dawson will be interested to have those conversations in his community. I doubt he will get too many people who say to him, 'I am very happy to see $80 million wasted on a political stunt,' which the Leader of the Opposition himself has said he would pay no regard to in any event. This is a political stunt, pure and simple, and shrill catcalling in favour of it does not change the character of it. It is a shrill political stunt - nothing more, nothing less.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question and for her concern about tackling climate change here in this parliament on behalf of her constituents. Yesterday Prime Minister Key from New Zealand came to Canberra and he proved something that can often be forgotten in this House of Representatives, which is that it is possible to be a conservative and to have policies and plans for your nation's future. It is actually possible to do that. We do not see any evidence of that on the opposition frontbench. The Prime Minister of New Zealand came to Canberra yesterday and demonstrated that it is possible to be a conservative and to have plans for the future. It is possible to be a conservative and to be up to tackling the challenge of climate change. New Zealand is tackling the challenge of climate change by pricing carbon.                     As fond as we are of our family in New Zealand, I do not believe that self-respecting Australians want to see New Zealand up to doing something that we do not do.                     I believe that we are confident and creative people. We are very fond of our New Zealand friends, but we are up to doing the same measures that they have done to deal with climate change and that means pricing carbon. I do not want to see our nation stand idle while the world passes us by and deals with a clean energy future. I certainly do not want to see New Zealand get in front of us, which is why we need to move to price carbon. Pricing carbon will accelerate our embrace of a clean energy future. What will that mean? On the weekend, I had the opportunity with the relevant minister, Minister Ferguson, to see what that would mean in the electorate of Newcastle and beyond. We saw, for example, the solar thermal technology at the CSIRO in Newcastle using the power of the sun to generate the energy we need for the future. The government were very pleased and very proud to be able to announce that we will support major solar developments in Queensland near Chinchilla and in New South Wales in Moree, new solar developments that will get us the clean energy of the future. Pricing carbon is all about accelerating these clean energy developments.                 It ultimately comes down to a choice. It is a choice that needs to be made by leaders on behalf of the nation, the kind of policy choice that leaders need to confront. Do you believe climate change is real? I do, and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Do you believe that we need to cut carbon pollution? I do, and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Do you believe we should do that in the most efficient way that we can? I do, and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Do you believe that big polluters should bear the price? I do, and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Do you believe we should assist Australian families? I do, and the Leader of the Opposition does not.                     The Leader of the Opposition stands for taking money from Australian families and giving it to big polluters. That is the difference.

  I am a little bit surprised to get this question from the shadow minister who has asked it, given that he was responsible for working with the now Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Penny Wong, to negotiate the bipartisan agreement on pricing carbon that was before this parliament during the last parliamentary term - a man who dedicated hour after hour after hour to working on a scheme to price carbon. We thank him for those efforts. The fact that now he has been asked to come to the dispatch box and ask this question just shows the hypocrisy of the opposition when it comes to pricing carbon, because of course we know that across the opposition there are people who believe, as we do, that climate change is real and that the most efficient way of dealing with climate change is to price carbon. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition used to believe that very, very firmly himself until he decided that it was in his political interest to run the protest campaign that he is running now - all opposition and no leader.                 The answer to the shadow minister's question is - and I refer to his wise words before the election - that he knows, as I do, that there are upwards pressures on electricity prices arising from things like underinvestment in distribution.                     He very, very clearly talked about those upwards pressures before the last election and indicated that electricity prices would rise no matter who formed the government after the election. I thank him for that honesty.                 On the question of carbon pricing, of course we are going to get big polluters to pay and we are going to use more than half that revenue to assist Australian families. At the same time, the shadow minister who asked the question is now backing - as a result of having to leave behind his former position because of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition - a rip-off of Australian families to take that money out of family budgets and to give it to big polluters. I will leave him with that position. We will put a price on big polluters and assist families.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. The member for Melbourne is asking me about an equal pay case being conducted before Fair Work Australia. I take this opportunity to remind the House that the only reason that that pay case is possible is that we got rid of Work Choices and we introduced, for the first time ever at the federal level, an equal pay principle which would enable the industrial umpire to fairly weigh the value of women's work. We know, of course, that it was women who suffered the most grievously under Work Choices, being forced in disproportionate numbers to take Australian workplace agreements that cut their pay and conditions. The Leader of the Opposition rejoiced in that day after day - in women having pay and conditions cut. We put in the equal pay principle in its current form so that occupations predoÂ­minantly occupied by women could, if they believe their wages to be undervalued, approach the industrial umpire and have that matter dealt with. The member for Melbourne is right: that matter is being dealt with by Fair Work Australia on behalf of some very hardworking and important people who work in our community services and social services area and who tend to be predominantly women. Before the last election we negotiated an agreement with their union, the Australian Services Union, so that we would work with them and particularly work on phase-in agreements for any pay rises flowing from this decision so that as a government we could responsibly manage the budget whilst appropriately recognising the value of the work of these working people, who are predominantly women.                  At the stage that the case is at now, we have formed a community sector wages group that is a consultative forum between the government and the representatives of these workers, the Australian Services Union. It is chaired on behalf of the government by the relevant parliamentary secretary, Senator Collins, who is the Parliamentary Secretary for Workplace Relations. It met on 6 June and we will continue to work through that group, and of course under the auspices of the industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, to ensure that we see a proper decision-making process, we see wage justice for the working women involved and we also see phase-in arrangements which mean that the government can properly manage its budget and support the services that these workers work in.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Since the government established the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the government has undertaken extensive consultation with various community representatives, roundtables and working groups with the business community dealing with the issue of jobs and the competitiveness in the trade-exposed parts of the economy and with energy security. Working groups and roundtables have met many times on those issues. Similarly groups involving non-government organisations dealing with matters as broad as energy efficiency, household assistance and environmental issues have also met many different times. The Climate Commission has been established and conducted a number of community fora so far, as says Professor Garnaut, and the government has consulted numerous other community organisations and represÂ­entatives. Many people have expressed views - prominent economists, religious leaders, business representatives, all supportive of carbon pricing through a market mechanism. And of course the Productivity Commission has done an extensive inquiry. So the government has engaged in extensive consultation. It has been widespread and it has been genuine.                  This stands in stark contrast to the approach that has been taken and is represented by the conduct of the coalition. All we see from the Leader of the Opposition are stunts. The latest one is the proposition for a plebiscite. There is no genuine consultation or commitment to consult genuinely with anyone on the other side of the chamber, not even members of his own front bench, as we understand it. Almost as soon as this stunt was announced in the News Ltd papers, on the front page of the tabloids, the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he would ignore the outcome, he would not accept the outcome. He puts up the stunt in the News Ltd tabloids and immediately disowns a potential outcome, saying he will not pay any regard to it. The Leader of the Opposition is so addicted to misrepresentation that he now continues to misrepresent his own position. He says he wants to listen to people and then says he does not care what the result is, he would not even do that.                  They cannot even get the basic details right. As the Leader of the House said a short while ago, the News Ltd papers were announcing that at 10 am yesterday this bill was going to be introduced. They just forgot one small detail - parliament was not sitting at 10 am. Nothing emerged. The House was not going to sit till 2.30. It is nothing but a stunt at taxpayers' expense that is being proposed by the Leader of the Opposition.                 There might be another reason that the Leader of the Opposition is attracted to this sort of approach. At various times, as we know, the Leader of the Opposition has advocated a carbon tax, then disowned a carbon tax; he has advocated an emissions trading scheme, then disowned an emissions trading scheme; he has advocated a market mechanism, then disowned a market mechanism. He has said he respects the science and then he says that the science is absolute crap. To cover all of the positions that the Leader of the Opposition has articulated, the plebiscite would have to be multiple choice. It would have to be a ballot paper the size of the Senate ballot paper to try and cover off all the silly positions that the Leader of the Opposition has had from time to time. In fact, what would be interesting would be to see the result of a ballot on the other side of the House, because we know there are plenty over there who agree with us, who want to tackle climate change and know our proposition is the best way to do it.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I know she was delighted last Saturday to attend, with the member for Newcastle, the opening of CSIRO's solar tower research facility by the Prime Minister. This facility, partly funded by a foundation grant of $5 million from the government funded Australian Solar Institute, represents a world-class research facility. It is in fact the largest solar-thermal research facility in the country and will ensure that Australia remains at the cutting edge of solar thermal technology. But the question goes to the all-important Solar Flagships Program, a $1.5 billion commitment as part of the Commonwealth government's Clean Energy Initiative of $5 billion. Last Saturday the Prime Minister was pleased to be able to announce the successful applicants under the first round of this key focus on solar technology, a $1.5 billion program. This announcement -                       and I am pleased that the member for Flinders is taking note - provides a record $770.5 million commitment to solar-thermal and solar photovoltaic technology in Australia. The two projects, one in New South Wales and one in Queensland, will be Australia's largest solar power stations, totalling 400 megawatts. They have a capacity to actually power more than 115,000 homes per annum. But, importantly, they have enabled us as a government to leverage more than $2 billion as a commitment to solar technology development in Australia. The project at Moree in New South Wales, in partnership with the New South Wales government, will receive funding of $306.5 million in a BP-led consortium to develop a 150 megawatt solar PV plant. This plant is nearly twice the size of any PV power plant operating in the world today. It is clearly cutting-edge, leading technology.                 I now turn to the Solar Dawn project in Chinchilla, in Queensland, a partnership with the Queensland government. This represents a 250-megawatt solar-thermal gas hybrid power plant and, if operating today, this would be the largest solar power plant on a single site in the world. Importantly, this represents the use of Areva technology. It is about bringing home Australian technology, invented by Dr Mills. We actually lost the technology overseas because of the failure of the Howard government to actually commit to real investment by firms in renewable energy technology development in Australia.                  All projects went through a rigorous assessment initiative by the Solar Flagships Council. Importantly, they are demonstÂ­rations of real value for money and our capacity to take forward our requirement to invest in renewable energy technology in Australia. This was reflected in an analysis, undertaken by Boston Consulting Group, which compared round 1 of our Solar Flagships Program with a Spanish feed-in tariff model. They have concluded that the government will spend between $1 billion and $1.6 billion less in present value terms than if we had offered the support on the basis of the Spanish feed-in tariff model. Clearly, the competitive tension that we actually built into this flagship program has enabled us to produce cutting-edge technology for development and best value for the Australian community. These projects are on track to actually produce on-grid energy, effective from December 2015. I commend this major clean energy initiative to the Australian community.

  I thank the member for his question, because this is an important reform for the Australian economy. It is an important reform so that we can continue to generate jobs for the future. It is an important reform to make sure that we increase our prosperity in future years. What we do know from all of the reports that we have received and, indeed, from the practice in New Zealand is that we can introduce a price on carbon pollution and do it in such a way whereby the economy continues to grow, incomes continue to grow and jobs continue to grow. Those on that side of the House are just intent on running a baseless scare campaign about a price on carbon pollution. Because they are such a policy-free zone, they do not have the wit to come to grips with or grasp the importance of such a substantial reform like this.                  There was a time in our political life where those on that side of the House did front up and did support some big reforms which were essential to our prosperity, including the big reforms of the eighties and the nineties - the floating of the dollar, the bringing down of the tariff wall and enterprise bargaining. Although I note that they most certainly did not support one of the most fundamental reforms, which was superannuation reform. They said that would bring down the house, burning. During the global financial crisis we saw how important that reform was to financial stability within our economy. We know that this can be done and done in a way whereby our economy continues to grow. We also know that it does bring challenges and we also know that business is under pressure. We understand that many businesses are under pressure from the high Australian dollar, for example. But we understand that if we make this reform we will continue to generate jobs. We also understand the fact that the cost of not acting is far higher than the cost of acting. Those opposite would want to delay action in this area and therefore ensure a much harsher adjustment down the track. We are doing the sensible thing that so many other countries around the world are doing and that, indeed, they are doing in New Zealand. We heard it yesterday. I have never seen a more disgraceful performance in this House than we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.                     There are numerous opportunities for small business in a clean energy economy. That point was made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and not just at his press conference yesterday. We understand that we can make this adjustment and generate the jobs of the future. The New Zealand Prime Minister was here yesterday to be welcomed to this parliament by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. In his welcome, the Leader of the Opposition proved that he is unfit for high office, because he chose to politicise that event in a way that was absolutely damaging. He is not fit for high office, and he is not up to the task of putting in place the fundamental reforms we need to support employment in our economy.

  I thank the member for this very important question. At the end of last year the government announced a fundamental banking reform package. Central to that package was the banning of mortgage exit fees from 1 July this year. It is important to get rid of mortgage exit fees so that customers have the capacity to walk down the road if they want to get a better deal.                 What do mortgage exit fees do? They lock families into loans with higher interest rates, in particular. They lock families into loan arrangements that can cost them a lot of money. We hear from those opposite a lot about the cost of living, so I was indeed gobsmacked and surprised to find that the shadow Treasurer has decided he wants to bring back unfair mortgage exit fees. Indeed, as we speak, the Liberal and National parties in the Senate are arguing for a return of unfair mortgage exit fees. This is how Choice has described the problem of mortgage exit fees:                 Business models based around trapping consumers in uncompetitive deals through complex and costly fees have no place in a reformed banking sector.                   Choice goes on to say:                 This is about giving power back to the most important people in Australia's banking sector - consumers.                 I can tell you that consumers do not count with the Liberal and National parties. The Liberal and National parties want families to bear the burden of unfair mortgage exit fees as high as $7,000 and then claim they understand the challenge of the cost of living. It is just incredible that they are moving in the Senate, as we speak, to bring back unfair mortgage exit fees. Shame on them. How could they come to this position? It might be different if they had a whole lot of other policies - if we could nominate five or six concrete policies they had. The only policy they have is to bring back unfair mortgage exit fees.                 We on this side of the House understand how important it is to get the fundamentals of the economy right, to make sure we bring our budget back to surplus and to make sure we look after people in the banking system. To this end, the minutes of the recent meeting of the RBA board included a very interesting comment:                   According to the Australian Government Budget for 2011/12, fiscal policy was expected to exert significant contractionary impulse on aggregate demand over the next two years.                 The Reserve Bank is endorsing the fiscal stance of this government, which is central to creating jobs and giving financial security to Australian families. And who is trying to wreck all of that? Those opposite, who want to wreck the surplus. We on this side of the House stand for responsible economic management, and they stand for wrecking the surplus and for irresponsible economic policy.

  I thank the member for Aston for his question. This is simply part of the continuing scare campaign being run by those opposite because they do not have the wit to put forward an alternative policy for this country. They do not have an alternative economic policy and they most certainly do not have a policy to deal with dangerous climate change. He raises the question of a plebiscite. I can tell you that there is certainly one 'yes' vote in this parliament for such a plebiscite, and that is from the member for Wentworth. We know that they on that side of the House are bitterly divided over climate change. We have the position of the Leader of the Opposition. He is a climate change sceptic. And we have the position of the member for Wentworth, who actually believes in the science and believes in a market based price.                     I am talking about climate change. I am talking about its importance to jobs. I am talking about its importance to future prosperity. It is very important that this very big challenge is one that is dealt with in this parliament. I was making the point that those on that side of the House are not up to the challenge of dealing with this very important issue and in fact are bitterly divided between the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth. Then of course there is the position of the shadow Treasurer.                     My answer to that question is very simple. There is only one way we can guarantee future prosperity. That is by putting a price on carbon pollution. If we do not act, the cost of not acting will be far higher. We have to move to a clean energy future.                     The second part of the question was about a plebiscite. I was referring to the fact that they are so divided on that side of the House that they did not even take the proposal for a plebiscite to their shadow cabinet. That is what I was asked about. That demonstrates how unqualified they are to deal with the very big challenges that we must deal with in this country to support prosperity and jobs.

  I am afraid from his question that the Leader of the Opposition is betraying how little he knows about this important area of economic reform. What I was required to do in my capacity as the relevant minister was to work with state and territory colleagues around the country to enter an agreement which would enable parliaments around the country to enact model laws and then enable those model laws to be followed up with the required codes and regulations, which would mean that wherever you were in the country, wherever you worked, as a working person you would have the benefits of the same protections and standards and that, as an employer, you would not have to engage with different regimes in different parts of the country.                  The quote that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to is my quote about what happened at the ministerial council the day that we struck this historic agreement. That was a very important moment of microeconomic reform, 30 years in the seeking, which was then delivered through that agreement between ministers, and that agreement is being actioned. The only problem, of course, with actioning that agreement has been the issues of the Liberal government in Western Australia, which wanted in part to stand outside the system. I say to the Leader of the Opposition -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. We continue to work through with the government of Western Australia, and I was very pleased to see their cooperative attitude.                 In coming to this parliament and playing politics with this matter, what the Leader of the Opposition is really betraying is that he does not care anything about the future of our country and the strength of our economy. First and foremost, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he really thinks these major microeconomic reforms are so easy, why wasn't it achieved under the Howard government? In 11 long years, this microeconomic reform was never achieved under the Howard government. COAG after COAG, then Prime Minister John Howard would go and sit down with his counterparts and enter agreements saying that he was going to get it done, and it never got done. It took this Labor government to strike this agreement after more than a decade of neglect by those opposite.                 If those opposite are in any doubt about the power of this agenda - this agenda we continue to pursue for a seamless national economy - then I suggest they put down their politics of protest for two or three minutes and actually go and talk to some of Australia's leading businesspeople who have been here in the parliament for the Business Council of Australia meeting. What they will find is not underestimation of the signifiÂ­cance of this reform; they will find deep understanding of the significance of this reform. They will also, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to ask them, wonder with him why this reform was not progressed under the Howard government. So to the Leader of the Opposition I would say: when you have a track record of no achievement, it seems a little bit odd to be criticising those who have achieved.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know she is interested in the future of this country and in the future of her constituents and their ability to have opportunity and prosperity.                      I understand that those from the opposition are not at all interested in these questions, but the member for Robertson rightly is. She asked me about the government's policies and plans to keep our economy strong. Mr Speaker, let me assure you and the House that there is nothing more important to this government than keeping the economy strong so Australians have the benefits and dignity of work.                 To keep our economy strong in this phase of our economic development we need to bring the budget back to surplus, which is why the recent budget delivered the fastest fiscal consolidation in 40 years.                      I am proud of that budget and proud of that achievement.                      It stands in stark contrast to the black holes and failure to account of those opposite.                     If you are going to keep your economy strong, you need to be able to address those problems that come from time to time - those things that Mother Nature throws at you. Our nation had a very difficult summer. To keep our economy strong for the long term, we need to rebuild. I am proud that we were able to work through to structure a progressive flood levy to fund the rebuilding. I am also pleased that we were able to find the tough cutbacks necessary to rebuild Queensland and the nation. We are making progress, with 6,600 kilometres of roads repaired, 411 affected schools reopened and significant commitments to the Bruce Highway and to the Warrego and Landsborough highways so that they can be rebuilt after the flooding.                 In addition, the government is determined that the nation builds for the future. As Prime Minister, I am not going to put this nation's future in the too-hard basket. That means that we do have to step up and deal with the challenge of climate change by getting polluters to pay, and we will do that. It means that we have to roll out the technology of the future - the National Broadband Network - which is why I am pleased that we were able to commence development not only in Tasmania but on the mainland, and to achieve the microeconomic reform of the structural separation of Telstra, something that eluded the Howard government year after year.                 We want to be investing in what Australian families need. Of course they need jobs, but they also need great quality education services. Along with our schools reforms, childcare reforms and university reforms, I am pleased we were able to deliver the $3 billion skills package in the recent budget. I am pleased that we have been able to strike a breakthrough health agreement to ensure that there are more doctors, more nurses, more local control and less waste. I am also pleased that we have been able to work with Australian families to slightly alleviate the cost-of-living pressures they face, with new money for families of teenagers and with school uniforms being added to the Education Tax Refund program to take a little bit of the pressure off.                 As Prime Minister, I am determined that we will keep the economy strong and that we will keep spreading the benefits of opportunity and prosperity to Australians. We are driven by getting results for the Australian nation, unlike those opposite, who are always diverted by the politics and the cheap political stunts.

  The first thing I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that Australia's relationships with the region are in excellent shape. Over the course of the last several years we have had to deal with certain legacy problems from those opposite. I draw the attention of honourable members to, for example, the relationship with Indonesia. I remember, as a member of this place within the last decade, an Indonesian government that would not pick up the phone to Prime Minister Howard, an Indonesian government that just opened the doors when it came to the flow of people through the Indonesia archipelago and a whole range of other measures by the then President of Indonesia because the state of the relationship with Australia was so poor.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks more broadly about our engagements with the region. On the question of the negotiations in which the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is currently engaged, we have together contributed processes such as the Bali process, which for the first time brings about a regional framework agreement and for the first time incorporates international legal standards into the way in which we operate assessment centres and undertake processing within our neighbourhood. On top of that, it provides specifically for the existence of assessment centres in the region, the first of 13 regions around the world to arrive at such an agreement. That has been made possible because we have an excellent fabric of relationships upon which to build such arrangements.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also spoke about the relationship with East Timor. The relationship with East Timor is in first-class working order. If anyone bothered to survey the detail of that in terms of Australia's ongoing engagement on the ground in Dili and the overall development program within East Timor, they would understand what is being invested in roads, what is being invested in hospitals, what is being invested in schools and the fact that we stand solidly by the people of East Timor in the long-term economic development of that country.                 I also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on her question about Papua New Guinea, that Australia proudly stands as the single largest source of external development assistance to the people of Papua New Guinea. That is why we are making a difference with HIV-AIDS infections in Papua New Guinea. That is why the overall primary school attendance ratio within Papua New Guinea has gone up 10 per cent in the last 18 months. That is why we are building roads across Papua New Guinea in partnership with the government of the country. That is why I, together with other government ministers, continue to be in direct engagement with our South Pacific counterparts.                 If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition also paid attention to today's reports she would have noticed that changes have now been made to the cabinet of Papua New Guinea. There is now a new foreign minister and a new finance minister. Because there has been a recent period of instability within the PNG government, it has been difficult to engage directly without being directly intrusive in the internal political affairs of that country. I look forward to visiting PNG at the earliest opportunity, having already spent a considerable amount of time on the phone and in the flesh with the current and continuing Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare. That relationship, together with the others I just referred to, is in first-class working order, having cleaned up some of the wreckage left behind by those opposite.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question because we on this side of the House welcomed the passage through the House last night of the appropriation bills. These bills will deliver on our commitment to bring the budget back in the black and will ensure that we see more Australians in work than ever before. There is nothing that we on this side of the House are prouder of than the fact that so many Australians are in work. Over the past year we have had a very strong job creation record and we are expecting the creation of a further half a million jobs over the next couple of years.                 Returning the budget to surplus is vital so that we do not compound the price pressures which will come with the investment boom. We must bring our budget back to surplus so we can have strong, sustainable growth for the long term. You cannot return the budget to surplus unless you constrain spending growth and put in place savings, which is why we have restricted real spending growth to one per cent on average. That compares to 3.7 per cent under those opposite at the height of mining boom mark 1. I was somewhat surprised to see a couple of days ago the shadow Treasurer attack the spending spree that the previous government went on at the height of mining boom mark 1 because that was a spending spree which put pressure on inflation and saw interest rates go up 10 times in a row. There is a stark contrast between the approach of those previously in government and what we are doing. We are putting in place very substantial savings. In this budget, there is $22 billion worth of savings. That is absolutely essential to strong economic management and maintaining strong growth, particularly job creation growth.                 The record of the government here was recognised by the Reserve Bank in their minutes published a couple of days ago where they made the point that fiscal policy will deliver a significant contraction of demand over the next couple of years. But this can only be done if our savings pass the parliament. Those opposite are currently blocking something like $6 billion worth of savings, having already opposed in this House something like $7 billion worth of savings, including one measure to do with alternative fuels which was a measure of the previous government. The fact is that you cannot keep saying that you support a return to surplus while trying to block the savings which will actually deliver the surplus. What they would be doing with this approach if they were in power is delivering deficits right across the forward estimates. They are still trying to wreck the surplus and all of the consequences of that for jobs.                 All of the stunts and all of the three-word slogans are not a substitute for an economic policy. We on this side of the House have a strong economic policy which supports strong job growth. For those on that side of the House, when it comes to economic policy, the cupboard is simply bare. We find this is the case when it comes to the reform of our banking sector. This government is committed to a stable and competitive banking sector, which is why we were absolutely stunned by the effort of the shadow Treasurer and those opposite to bring back mortgage exit fees. They claim to be concerned about the cost of living, but in their attempt to bring back unfair mortgage exit fees they are pushing up the cost of living for thousands of Australians. This measure is terribly important to get rid of unfair mortgage exit fees. In the Senate they were trying to also -

   I thank the member for McEwen for his question. The Gillard government is delivering on a regional framework to both break the people smugglers' business model and improve protection outcomes for genuine refugees across the region. As part of this, of course, we have reached an agreement with Malaysia that will see 800 asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia while Australia resettles 4,000 refugees over the next four years. This will see Australia's humanitarian intake increase to its highest level since Labor was last in office, in 1996. That is something this side of the House is very proud of. That is an essential part of our framework: resettling more refugees who have been waiting for resettlement mandated by the United Nations convention on refugees. The opposition says that this is unfair. The opposition says that we are resettling too many refugees from Malaysia and that is unfair. We disagree. We say that it would be unfair not to. I am asked about the role that visits to Malaysia have played in this process. It is the case that in the nine months I have been Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I have been to Malaysia four times to discuss, with not only ministerial counterparts but Malaysian line agencies, models which could improve our system of breaking the people smugglers' business model. I have been discussing with the UNHCR and the IOM in Malaysia protections that can be put in place for the 800 people we are transferring to Malaysia.                 I saw on the weekend that the member for Cook has announced he will go to Malaysia as well. I thought: 'Maybe this is a good thing. Maybe this shows he is reconsidering his position. Maybe if he goes to Malaysia he might change his mind about the government resettling 4,000 people from Malaysia over the next four years. He might think that is a good idea. He might see, if there are appropriate protections in place, that the transfer of people from Australia to Malaysia is a good thing. This might be a genuine fact-finding mission.' But, alas, it will shock the House to learn that that is not the case. This is not a genuine fact-finding mission. It is a stunt. He has said that, no matter what he sees in Malaysia, it will not change his mind. I have said that this is a stunt that will go down in the Guinness Book of World Records. It is hard to think of a bigger stunt than going to another country to attack this government and that government, except perhaps for calling a plebiscite which is not going to change your mind either. That might be bigger. That is an argument the House might want to have.                 This is such a negative opposition that it is not good enough to stay in Australia and attack this government; they go to another country and attack their government as well. That is how negative this opposition has become. This underlines the hypocrisy of the opposition. This hypocrisy goes to several levels. We know that the member for Cook has suggested a transfer arrangement, not with Malaysia - in fairness - but with Iran. We know that. But there has been an interesting development. Some honourable members would have seen the member for Cook on Lateline last night. For those who did not, I feel obliged to inform the House that he has backtracked on the agreement with Iran and said:                 It wouldn't be a bilateral deal involving Australia or even one that Australia would advance.                 When in November he said:                 In my view, Australia's participation in a regional solution for Afghanistan should seek to trade off Australia taking more refugees _                 He went on to say that this would deal with asylum claims through illegal entry to Australia. It sounds like a deal that Australia would be involved in to me, but maybe I am wrong about that or maybe he is backtracking because he has not been able to negotiate protections with President Ahmadinejad, or maybe he is about to announce a fact-finding mission to Tehran. We wait to see with interest.

  I thank the member for his question. I will make the point again that we can grow strongly and we can at the same time substantially reduce carbon pollution. We can do that and we must do that if we are going to be a prosperous economy into the future. All of the modelling, all of the evidence and all of the reports that we have received show a number of things. They show that economic growth will remain strong. They also show that incomes growth will remain strong. They also show that jobs growth will remain strong. They show all of those things and they also show that the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. They show that we can be a prosperous, growing economy where industries like the sugar industry do well.                 We have heard a lot from a number of the members from regional Queensland - whether it is Mackay, Rockhampton, up around North Queensland or further up to Cairns - about growth. We know that we have a very strongly growing resource sector in that state, with very strong investment. We know that a carbon price will in no way endanger those industries. Those industries will be strong. Those industries will continue to grow and they will continue to grow because many of the investors in those industries have already factored a carbon price into their investments. We know all of those things.                 What we have from those on the other side of the House is a continuing scare campaign. They know that other countries are moving to reduce their carbon pollution. They know that we are a great trading nation and that, if we do not take action in this area into the future, many of our great export industries could be in danger of trade sanctions from other countries. So, whether it is the sugar industry or whether it is the coal industry, everybody has a stake in putting in place a price on carbon so we can grow responsibly and reduce our carbon pollution.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. He, like me, is proud to be part of the Labor Party, which is committed to protecting workers' rights. That is why the first act of this government when it came in was to remove Work Choices and implement Fair Work Australia, an initiative that was steered by the current Prime Minister in exhaustive negotiations with all of the parties to get the balance back into the system that the other side had stripped away. It was built around the principle of recognising the importance of collective bargaining, of requiring the parties to bargain in good faith and ensuring that, where differences could not be resolved, they would go to an independent umpire. Not only did this reintroduce fairness to the system; it also underpinned the prosperity that this nation has experienced over the last three years, with increased jobs - some 740,000, as the Treasurer has talked about, with half a million more in prospect. We have seen a fall in industrial disputes and we have seen economic growth and wages growth.                 I am also asked if there are any threats to the system. Yes, there are. They have already begun in New South Wales, hardly a couple of months into the term of a new coalition government. Last Thursday, legislation was passed in the New South Wales parliament that will enable the government to direct by regulation the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission - in other words, stripping out the role of the independent umpire. The first regulation that appeared under this legislation was gazetted on Monday, and it has put a cap on the wages of state employees. This has undermined the very principles that we have fought for, and it had nothing to do with what they promised during the election campaign because Premier O'Farrell said, 'We are committed to retaining the current system.' How many times do we hear it said on the other side that they are not committed to returning to Work Choices?                 The threat does not stop with the New South Wales parliament. Last Wednesday, in this parliament, the member for Kooyong entered this debate. His contribution to this debate, after going through a litany of criticism about what was wrong with Work Choices, was to say that it is now time to 'speak out for change'. He then gave Michelle Grattan a backgrounder indicating that he was part of the push to try and get the Leader of the Opposition to return to Work Choices, to give them more flexibility. But, if there was any doubt about what the intention of this new ginger group is on industrial relations, it turns out that the member for Kooyong is also a supporter of the return to the presidency of the Liberal Party in Victoria of one Peter Reith. Remember Peter Reith - the man of the rottweilers, the man of the balaclavas?                     The member for Kooyong, in endorsing Mr Reith, talked about Mr Reith's reformist credentials, but his reforms were to introduce Work Choices. That is what they want to return to. They are not reformers. In terms of Work Choices, the coalition has form. They will return to Work Choices and we will oppose it.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question - and obviously he is joined by some friends down that end of the parliament! Can I take the opportunity to acknowledge some friends in the gallery from Modbury High. The member for Makin I think is particularly pleased to see them here.                 But if I could now directly respond to the member for Kennedy's question. The member for Kennedy has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions privately, and I know that he is very concerned about it and it has been something that he has pursued across a lifetime of political work, not only here in this parliament but in the Queensland state parliament beforehand. I know that when he was Queensland state Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he introduced far-reaching land reforms to try and assist with this question of title. Even today these leases that he created when he was the relevant minister are known as 'Katter leases', and I think that is a great tribute to him. It was one of the first attempts to harness the land to enable economic development for Aboriginal people, and I know he is proud of it.                 As the member for Kennedy is aware, the Queensland government has legislated land tenure changes on Indigenous land and is developing the necessary land administration systems in remote Indigenous communities to enable long-term leasing. In Queensland the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Islander Land Act 1991 were amended in 2008 to allow long-term leasing of up to 99 years of community title land for private residential and commercial purposes. No 99-year leases have been entered into as yet, as the necessary survey work needs to be done.                 The Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management has released a discussion paper about the way we can potentially enhance the utility of these leases for commercial and private residential purposes. And the proposed amendments also provide measures for regularising these estates with the balance of Indigenous lands to facilitate further economic development.                 So I understand that, from the point of view of the member for Kennedy, progress in this matter has been painfully slow, because he did such good work when he was in the Queensland parliament. I know that he is aware that there is a need here to work with community ownership structures but to give sufficient security to private individuals such that they are able to have homes, and have a connection to their homes in the same way Australians generally want that connection with the place they call home, and to have the ability to develop viable businesses that can then be sold so that the labour that you put into your business not only supports you in an income sense but also builds up capital for you when you want to realise that capital. So we are working through that with the Queensland government; we will continue to do so. I can understand the member for Kennedy's frustration that he would like to see quicker progress, but progress is occurring.

  I thank the member for Calwell for her question and for her long campaigning for paid parental leave, not just in her own electorate but across the country. When the government's paid parental leave scheme started on 1 January this year Australia finally caught up with the rest of the developed world. It has been a very, very long time coming. Australian families have waited decades for this historic reform. And of course it is a fundamental reform that was delivered by this Labor government, a reform that so many people in our community campaigned for and is now operating.                 Since the scheme began 65,000 new and expecting parents have claimed parental leave. Right now more than 30,000 new parents are receiving the government's paid parental leave, so there are 30,000 families benefiting. The good news is that Australian businesses are also playing their part. Employers have been able to register since 1 January and also start providing government funded paid parental leave to their long-term employees. We now have more than 8,000 employers already registered and 400 employers playing their part, providing government funded paid parental leave to their employees. The employer role will be fully implemented from 1 July, so very soon we will have the full implementation of this part of the paid parental leave scheme - and I would encourage all employers to register and get ready for the benefits that will flow as they are able to provide paid parental leave to their long-term employees. I think we know, and employers who are already using the scheme know, it does provide great benefits to their employees. We know that women return to work after taking time off for their babies, and they are much more likely to do that if they receive paid parental leave.                 We have also made sure that the scheme that we are establishing is as easy as possible for businesses. Business will get the money upfront. We will make sure that they get their money upfront from the government and that they are able to pay their employees using their usual pay cycle. They will not have to have any special accounts or any special reports. One of the things that the Minister for Human Services and I did yesterday was release a toolkit for employers so that they have more information available for them and they know what they can do from 1 July.                 By contrast, of course, what we see from those opposite, from the Leader of the Opposition, is a policy that costs $4.5 billion a year and needs a new tax from the Leader of the Opposition to pay for it.                     It is this Labor government that is delivering for mums and dads. We are making sure that they have paid parental leave.

  We know that a market price is the best way, the least-cost way, of reducing carbon pollution. We also know that in doing that our economy does have to make a transition, because we have to reduce emissions and we have to do it particularly when it involves some of those institutions, such as power stations, which are emitting very large amounts of carbon pollution. Those on that side of the House, in name anyway, share something in common with the government - that is, they have a commitment to reduce emissions by up to five per cent. So everybody in this House knows that we will have to reduce our emissions, particularly from those power stations which are least efficient. That is well known by everybody on both sides of the House, and we should stop the hypocrisy that is coming from that side of the House, which somehow pretends that there will not be some actions taken in this area.                  What this government is committed to, however, is ensuring the energy security of our nation. We are absolutely committed to that. We are absolutely committed to assisting our energy-intensive trade-exposed industries in that transition. So we have said very clearly about the revenue which will be raised from a price on carbon that it will go to households but also to industry. We have made that very clear because we, unlike many on that side of the House, understand and believe in the science of climate change and we cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore this challenge. So with us you will get a clear plan for the future which will assist households and a clear plan for the future which will assist industry. That stands in stark -                    The member for Brisbane then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question because -                      unlike those members opposite, she and those on this side of the House -                    The member for Aston then left the chamber.                     I thank the member for Chisholm for her question, because she is interested, like members on this side of the House, in the reforms that have delivered benefits to patients across the country. But, although the member for Chisholm is interested, unfortunately the opposition health spokesperson has not asked a question about all of our health investments for nearly two years.                      Two years is so long ago that the member for Dickson was actually looking for a condominium down in Surfers Paradise that long ago but now -                      So our health reforms, which have been asked about multiple times from our side of the House, are already delivering hundreds of beds across the country, hundreds of extra doctors across the country and new mental health investments across the country, and there has not been a single question from the opposition health spokesperson to me about billions and billions of dollars of investments. Why is that?                     Our investments, billions of dollars of investments, in health reform are delivering to patients across the country just as we speak. There are now 900 GPs in training this year, when the Leader of the Opposition put a cap in place such that only 600 GPs could train each year. There are more than 1,300 new beds being opened up across the country, including 300 in New South Wales that have already been delivered, 400 that are starting to be opened in Victoria, 150 extra mental health beds and equivalents that are opening up in South Australia and mental health investments in Queensland. And I have not had a single question from the health spokesperson opposite about any one of these investments. Why is that? Why have there been no questions? Because the Leader of the Opposition, as the health minister, did not fix these problems. It has been our government, with a deal that was reached by the Prime Minister in April this year that has enabled us to deliver these reforms. Look at some other investments: the specialists that are being funded to be trained, particularly in rural and regional Australia, where I know that our crossbench members are particularly interested - 518 specialists, more than half of whom are now working in rural and regional areas. That is a ninefold increase from when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. I have not had a single question about these investments. Why? Because these investments matter to patients, these investments matter to consumers, and the Liberal Party are more interested in their petty politics than they are interested in delivering to patients across the country.

  In answer to the shadow minister's question, I believed it was appropriate to provide information to the Australian community about the approach we were taking. When I was in a position to release a joint statement with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, I did. I believe that provided advice to the Australian community about the government's approach. Of course we are continuing to pursue discussions with Malaysia, as the shadow minister is aware. Those discussions are in an advanced state. I trust that when the shadow minister travels to Malaysia soon he does not conduct himself in a manner that is inappropriate for a member of parliament when overseas.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I commend the work she has done representing her electorate during a spate of natural disasters and those on both sides of the House who have done an excellent job in that respect. The winter has given us a reprieve, I suppose, from the cyclone season and from bushfires, but regrettably not so with respect to floods. Just this week, we declared four additional local government areas as being flood affected. They were in the mid-North Coast and the Hunter regions of New South Wales, making a total of 18 local government areas entitled to assistance.                 Natural disasters are of course just that: a natural part of our environmental history. But so is the ability of the Australian people to respond and to bounce back from those disasters. Communities all around Australia are rebuilding and indeed rebuilding so that they are even stronger and more resilient. The federal government are assisting in that respect. For instance, in Queensland we have made an advanced payment of some $2Â½ billion for the reconstruction effort. So far much is occurring: 6,627 kilometres of roads have been repaired of the 9,170 kilometres damaged; 4,421 of rail repaired of a total of 4,748; 411 schools have been re-opened and 11 ports; and, in the member for Capricornia's electorate, with the Queensland government we have given $900,000 to the Rockhampton Regional Council to undertake emergency repairs on the runway at the airport.                 In the longer term, we are contributing $144 million to repairs of the Bruce Highway near Cardwell; in south-west Queensland, $192 million to repairs to the Warrego and Landsborough highways; $84 million to Cunninghams Gap; and, in the Mackay and Whitsundays regions, we are contributing some $300 million to repairs to the regional roads. That project alone is going to result in 1,050 jobs repairing some 257 kilometres of roadways. Other communities around Australia are also being assisted. The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government announced low-cost loans for those areas affected by the recent Victorian floods for businesses, primary producers and not-for-profit organisations. In Western Australia, the Gascoyne region was also affected by floods. We have undertaken repairs to the North Western Coastal Highway, and also main roads have been reopened around the Gascoyne Junction. Assistance has also been provided under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements to New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania.                 Around Australia we are in a situation where we are now transitioning from disaster recovery to long-term reconstruction. To have achieved so much in such a relatively short period of time is quite remarkable. That is a tribute to governments of all persuasions around the country working in partnerships and with non-government organisations. Wherever possible we are focusing on betterment - that is, ensuring that any repair and reconstruction work is at a higher standard. This is going to make our country in turn more resilient and in the future more capable of preventing, responding to and recovering from natural disasters that are a natural part of our environment.

  In relation to the member's question I would say the following: as she would be aware from the statements I have made and the minister for immigration has made in this place and also in the media, we are going to agree with Malaysia that the human rights of asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia are respected.                 On the question of Nauru as an alternative to Malaysia, I want to send the strongest possible message to people smugglers. I want to break the very business model for the business that they ply. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister and the member who asked the question want to send a much weaker message to people smugglers. I will leave them with the weaker policy. The government will pursue the stronger policy. The stronger policy is a transfer agreement. The stronger policy is being able to say to people smugglers and to asylum seekers, 'If you risk your life at sea, if you pay your money to a people smuggler, you end up at the back of the queue in Malaysia.' The message that the opposition wants to send is, 'If you risk your life at sea, if you pay a people smuggler, you will go to Nauru for a period of time and then end up in Australia.' That is why it is a weaker message. So we will pursue the stronger approach to border protection. We will leave the member who asked the question and the Leader of the Opposition with the much weaker approach.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The fact is that this government has already delivered more education reform than the Howard government managed in over a decade and since coming into office it has proceeded to rebuild, from the Commonwealth, school education after a decade of ignorance and neglect from those opposite. We have almost doubled the investment in education to some $64.9 billion. Australian students are now studying in new libraries and classrooms as a consequence of a $16 billion investment in school infrastructure - 24,000 projects at 9,500 schools across Australia. We have introduced Australia's first national curriculum: English, maths, science and history from kindergarten to year 12, with geography, languages and arts to follow. We have introduced Australia's first national teacher standards. For the first time teachers will be identified on the basis of quality in a national system. We are introducing Australia's first national bonus pay system for the best and brightest of those teachers with $425 million to make sure that teachers are recognised and rewarded. And we are investing some $480 million to empower local schools. We know that local communities and school principals have an idea about what will work best and we trust them to make those decisions.                 We are rewarding schools that make the most difference to our students through the $165 million Reward for School Improvement program. Of course, there is $2.5 billion available in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, identifying our most disadvantaged students, including our Indigenous students, so that they can improve in key areas of literacy and numeracy. This is investment by this government that is transforming schools and changing lives. If you add the 430,000 computers and the $2.5 billion in the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, you will get a strong and clear idea of the level of investment and commitment to education that this government has.                 I happened to notice a quote from somebody who probably has a bit of a feel for education, who said -                    The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                     The fact that the member for Sturt has responsibility for education in this House on behalf of the opposition and has now been ejected from the parliament tells us everything we need to know about the opposition's commitment to education. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, this is a quote from someone who knows: 'We have the My School website, which certainly has its advantages. We have national curriculum coming on. We have national partnerships in literacy. We have national partnerships in teacher performance. We have national teacher registration coming. We have the national BER program.' The author of that quote was the Minister for Education in the Victorian coalition government, Martin Dixon. Need I say any more? Well, I will.                 The fact is they on that side of the House do not like hearing about these achievements. They want to cut $2.8 billion out of the education budget. The fact is that for over a decade they managed 3,000 flagpoles; we are supporting some 3,000 libraries. Our commitment to education recognises that it is the great enabler. This government will continue to produce the commitment, the policies and the support to make sure that every school is a great school. That is right at the heart of this government's agenda.

  Are there any risks! I thank the member for Bass for his question. I can advise the House that the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement was negotiated almost 30 years ago by the Fraser and Muldoon governments. Subsequent additions to the CER agreement have more fully integrated our two economies, moving us towards a single regional market. The fact is that the CER agreement is a gold-standard agreement. An investment agreement that was reached just earlier this year between the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand will further deepen our economic integration.                 I was asked about putting a price on carbon and a carbon market. We do know that the government of New Zealand has put a price on carbon and is establishing a domestic carbon market. In Australia, the government is determined to put a price on carbon and establish a domestic carbon market. In the spirit of the CER agreement there is in fact great potential to establish an Australia-New Zealand carbon market, and what a good thing that would be.                 To do its work in reducing carbon emissions at the least cost, any such market would need to be stable. I am asked about the risks to such a market. The truth is that the opposition leader would destroy that stability by abandoning an emissions trading scheme. He says: 'Yes, that is right. Believe me, I would abandon an emissions trading scheme.' Well, let us turn to his statements. In the middle of July 2009 the now opposition leader was urging the then opposition leader, the member for Wentworth - wait for it - to support the Labor government's emissions trading scheme. He wrote in an opinion piece:                 Opposition tends to be a permanent debating society because even the most final decisions can sometimes be revisited in office.                 So what he is saying is, 'Even though I write it down - it is the gospel truth and it is carefully scripted - don't believe what I say and don't believe what I write down in opposition, because anything can be changed in government.' He is not a Leader of the Opposition, he is a captain of a permanent debating society, and the case he always prosecutes is, 'No, no, no, no and no.'                 When the opposition leader says that what he says in opposition will not necessarily carry over into government, we have had evidence of that. Remember the Medicare safety net? He would not change that; it was an iron-clad, rolled-gold, rock-solid promise. Well, he changed it all right. Now he is saying that he will not touch the mining tax. He will get rid of the mining tax. But the truth is that if he were to win government I would not be too happy if I were Andrew Forrest or the others because the mining tax will stay. And what has he really been saying about Work Choices? 'It is dead, buried and cremated.' We know that the opposition leader, even if it is written down gospel truth, would bring back Work Choices and create a new threat to the living standards of every working man and woman in this country.

  To the Leader of the Opposition let me say: I understand that families around the country feel the pressures of the world we live in and particularly the cost-of-living pressures on their shoulders. I understand that very, very keenly. That is why we want to work with families on those cost-of-living pressures and why we want to work with them to improve the services that they rely on and to improve their prospects in the future. There is nothing more important to the prospects of Australian families than keeping the economy strong and making sure that people have the benefits and dignity of work, which is why I am so pleased that we were able to manage the economy so that Australia came out of the global financial crisis stronger than any other developed country in the world and that over the next two years we will create half a million jobs.                 I am also pleased that we are able to continue our work with families to assist them with cost-of-living pressures. We have of course provided tax cuts for three years. We created the education tax refund to help with the costs of getting kids to school. We have added to that in the recent budget by enabling families to recover some of the money they spend on kids' uniforms. We have worked with families to alleviate the burden of childcare fees, increasing the childcare tax rebate to 50 per cent and, in the recent budget, moving to a fortnightly payment arrangement so that people do not need to be so far out of pocket before they see some money come back from the government. We have also assisted the lowest income Australians, those eligible for the low-income tax offset, by bringing forward some of the payments that they would have otherwise not been eligible for. This move in the recent budget means that they will better see the rewards of work.                     For the information of the House, I was referring to a measure in the last budget. I really find it quite offensive that members of the opposition are so cavalier about the needs of low-income Australians that they do not understand a major measure in the last budget involving the low-income tax offset and enabling people to see more money earlier so that they can better see the rewards of work.                 We have increased the family tax benefit for the parents of teenagers, a benefit that is worth more than $4,000 a year to families on the maximum rate. Families also rely on services. I want them to have the best of health services, which is why earlier this year I entered an agreement with premiers and chief ministers around the country which means more doctors, more nurses, more local control and less red tape. We will finalise the details of that agreement at the forthcoming COAG.                 People in this parliament are aware of my passion for extending opportunity. We have built on our earlier education reforms with a $3 billion skills package in the recent budget. I am very proud that that will enable people to get that all-important training place and get a better job and a better prospect in life. We have also delivered in the context of the recent budget new welfare measures to better enforce opportunity and responsibility around our country. We have done all of that, and we are bringing the budget back to surplus exactly as promised to alleviate inflationary pressures in our economy. I am very happy for the Leader of the Opposition to keep talking about what the government has done in the face of his relentless negativity and just saying no.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. It is a good thing Brendan Nelson is in the gallery, given the work he did with me when we attended the NATO summit at the end of last year. As Australians would have seen today, President Obama has made an important annÂ­ouncement about the international effort in Afghanistan. To use President Obama's words as he talked about the clear progress that is being made in Afghanistan, 'We are now working from a position of strength.' Those were President Obama's words. His message was that the transition strategy is on track towards achieving the goal set by President Karzai in Afghanistan that the Afghan state be able to assume responsibility for its own security by the end of 2014.                 Australia shares President Obama's assessment that progress is being made and that the transition strategy is on track. As I have had cause in the past to report to the House, we believe that we have reversed the momentum of the insurgency that our troops face. We are training Afghan security forces and they are becoming more capable and more able to operate on their own. We have hit al-Qaeda hard. President Obama talked today about the hardest hit of all with the death of bin Laden. And we are helping the Afghan authorities to improve the lives of the people of Afghanistan.                 I understand that many Australians today will have listened to President Obama's words, particularly his words about drawing down American troops in Afghanistan. They may be thinking to themselves, 'If President Obama is drawing down troops, what does that mean for Australia and what does that mean for our mission?' I think it is very important we get a sense of scale and context here. The Americans put in 30,000 additional troops in a surge to take their troop involvement to around 100,000. We have around 1,500 troops involved in Afghanistan. President Obama outlined a draw-down strategy for the troops involved in the surge. Then he charted the course forward on transition. He has said that he is looking for a draw down, and one will occur by the end of this year and then continue throughout 2012. Then he is looking beyond transition in 2014 to what he refers to as an enduring partÂ­nership as the international community continues to support the Afghan government. To those who may be concerned that America is drawing down, I say to them that the context is of far higher troop involvement and the quite rapid surge, with the draw down now to come.                 The advice that I have had from the Chief of the Defence Force as recently as this morning is that our current troop presence remains appropriate for our mission. I am also advised that we do not expect that there will be any significant implications for the US-Australian joint efforts in Oruzgan from the draw down of the surge. We are on course in Afghanistan. It is hard work. It is dangerous work. It is work that on too many occasions has required us to mark moments of condolence in the House. But we are on course and we will be staying that course. With President Obama's statement today we have a further insight into his thinking and the strategy ahead as Afghanistan begins to transition to local security leadership.

  We see a continuation of the opposition's strategy. We see it on display every day. I have referred to the Leader of the Opposition in the past as coming into this place with a mouth full of insults and no ideas for the nation's future, and we are seeing a continuation of that strategy today. Whilst the opposition engage in their politics of stunt and carry-on, which we have seen across this parliamentary week as much as we have seen across other parliamentary weeks, we will leave them with these debates that they think are interesting in this parliamentary chamber.                  What really drives me and drives this government is matters beyond this chamber that make a difference to the lives of Australian families. I do not take too many questions from the opposition about jobs. I do not take too many questions from the opposition about health. I do not take too many questions from the opposition about education and getting a future for Australia's children. I do not take too many questions from the opposition about broadband and having the infrastructure of the future. I do not take too many questions from the opposition about bringing the budget back to surplus.                      As I was saying, I do not take too many questions from the opposition about bringing the budget to surplus. I certainly do not take any questions from the member for Mackellar about the circumstances of older Australians. And I have certainly never heard an explanation from her as to why it took this government, this Labor government, to deliver a historic pension increase and why she was a member of a government that never delivered a historic pension rise. I certainly do not hear from the member -                      I have certainly never taken a question from the member for Mackellar about superannuation earnings and decent retirement incomes for working Australians - something of course we are committed to; lifting superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent and using some of the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax to do what government need to do to make that policy change possible. I would have thought, representing older Australians in this place, she might have a care and concern about retirement incomes. But, of course, we do not ever see the opposition ask questions about things that require thinking and policies and plans and budgeting and having a vision for the nation's future. We never hear them ask questions about those things because they do not do any thinking, they do not have any positive plans, they have never done any budgeting and they do not have any vision for the nation's future. Instead, day after day, they go out with relentless negativity that ultimately costs Australian families. If you are in the business of smashing the budget surplus, you are costing Australian families. If you are in the business, as the opposition is, of voting against positive changes in health and education, then your negativity is costing Australians families.                      If you are in the business of ripping the National Broadband Network out of the ground, then your relentless negativity is costing Australian families. At some point the Leader of the Opposition will need to rethink this strategy of relentless negativity. Whilst he does so, we will get on with the job.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question - a woman with considÂ­erable expertise when it comes to these questions, an expertise she has been able to share with us in our discussions within the government about the National Broadband Network. Can I say to the parliament I do not think anything could better symbolise the difference between a government focused on the future and understanding what this nation needs for the future and political parties like the Liberal Party and the National Party trapped in the past.                  We are determined to deliver the National Broadband Network, and it is being rolled out as we speak, as we stand here, around mainland Australia. I am very pleased that I had the opportunity to turn the NBN on in mainland Australia, in Armidale, earlier this year. What does the National Broadband Network mean? It means for Australian businesses greater productivity and competitiveness. It means for Australians better health care. It literally means that a mother with a sick baby in her home at night can get face-to-face health care through the power of the National Broadband Network. It means that Australian school kids and adults who are learning skills, whether it be at a trade centre or in a university, can have the best of education brought to them from around the world. It means ending for all time the burdens that regional Australia has lived with because of the tyranny of distance and because of the differential costs in telecommunications.                  We are determined to roll out the National Broadband Network because we understand this vision of the future. Today we took another major step forward. Of course, we have taken the step forward of turning it on in mainland Australia. We have taken the step forward of getting the structural separation of Telstra - something that eluded the Howard government as a microeconomic reform. I do thank the member for Wentworth for acknowledging the signifiÂ­cance of the microeconomic reform we have achieved, with the words:                  It was honestly a failure of imagination on our part in government. We should have worked out a way to enable Telstra to be separated in a way that preserved and enhanced shareholder value.                 Lack of imagination on that side; a vision for the future over here - we got it done. The reform that eluded the Howard governÂ­ment - we have got it done. Today we have taken another big step forward with the agreements with Telstra and Optus, which mean that the copper network will be decommissioned, that the customer base of Telstra will move to the National Broadband Network, and we will get the savings and efficiencies that come with rolling out broadband through the infrastructure that already exists. That means faster rollout. It means less overhead cabling. This is unambiguously good news for Australians who are waiting for broadband. It is unambiguously good news if you care about the competitiveness of our nation against other economies around the world. It is unambiguously good news if you care about Australians getting the health and education services of the future. It is unambiguously good news if you care about regional Australia. This is the telecommunications structure and infrastructure our nation needs today and I am very pleased that today we were able to deliver this big step forward in getting faster broadband, more choice and cheaper prices to Australians around the nation.

 To the member's question I would say that I understand that the opposition have forgotten about Australian families - forgotten about their jobs, forgotten about the health services they need, forgotten about the education services they need, forgotten about the infrastructure they need and forgotten about everything that supports Australian families. That is why they have no plans to bring the budget back to surplus to help deal with inflationary pressures, no plans in health, no plans in education. They want to rip the NBN out of the ground. They have no plans at all to alleviate cost-of-living pressures. You cannot deliver to Australian families if you cannot make the budget add up. So I understand that the opposition have forgotten Australian families - absolutely right; correct.                     I was simply making the point about the families that the opposition has forgotten. The member who asked the question has forgotten ever to ask about the $23 million cancer centre delivered in her electorate by this government. If she was remembering the needs of Australian families she might have used her opportunity today to ask a question about that.                 In answer to the member's question on asylum seeker policy, I say to the member that the answer is as simple as this: the opposition has tied itself in so many political knots in this area that it stands today in this House supporting a weaker policy. We stand supporting a stronger policy. We are determined to break the business model of people smugglers. You are determined not to do that. I will stick with our strong border protection policy. You can try and justify your weak one.

  I thank the member for his question. Whilst it may not -                    The member for Hume then left the chamber.                     In answer to the member's question, whilst it may not have been in the form that the member was anticipating, I believe that we are now in the situation where we do regularly and very publicly provide the strategic outlook for Afghanistan to the Australian people by having a parliamentary debate. That is something that we had last year. It is something that we are committed to annually and I believe that that is the appropriate and most formal time for me as Prime Minister to update the Australian nation on the strategic outlook in Afghanistan.                 Of course, in between those very formal occasions in the parliament, the Minister for Defence keeps updating the parliament, and consequently the Australian public, on our view of the strategic outlook. Our view of the strategic outlook is that we are on course to transition. We always indicated that Oruzgan province, where we work, would not be amongst the first areas to transition, but that progress is being made. The insurgency is being countered and we are acquitting our training mission, and these are the preconditions to move into leadership by Afghan local forces of the security environment.                 I hope that when we come to update the House on Afghanistan through my formal statement later this year we will be in a position to provide more particular guidance about what transition in Oruzgan province means. As I have indicated to the parliament before, it will not be a transition day for the whole province but a more finely calibrated place-by-place transition. I would hope we would be in a position to provide more information to the parliament and to the Australian public through that important statement and the ensuing debate on Afghanistan, where I anticipate people will put a variety of views, as is absolutely appropriate in this place, on something as important to the nation as Afghanistan.                 On the question of continued engagement in other work and activities in Afghanistan, I know through his dissenting report the member took a particular interest in governance, in aid and in what makes a nation in Afghanistan. As the member is aware, we are engaged in governance and aid work and I have said publicly, and I am happy to reiterate, we will stay engaged in Afghanistan beyond 2014 in assisting the Afghan people. President Obama has spoken today about the enduring need for that partnership between the international community and the people of Afghanistan. I am always happy to look again at a parliamentary report, and the member has invited me to do so, but I believe we have achieved his broad aims in that we now have a much more regular and detailed way for the Australian nation to consider the strategy in Afghanistan through the regular parliamentary statements and debates.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Despite recent natural disasters, which did have a very substantial impact on growth in the March quarter, our economy remains in good nick and continues to be one of the best performing developed economies in the developed world. Australian GDP is significantly higher now than it was before the global financial crisis, and that is in very stark contrast with many other developed economies. Of course, we do have an unemployment rate with a 4 in front of it. That also stands in very stark contrast to what is happening in many other developed economies. Our peak net debt is less than one-tenth of the average of major advanced economies. We are bringing our budget back to the black in 2012-13.                 But I guess the source of greatest pride for this government is the number of jobs that have been created in our economy in the past 12 months - 250,000 jobs in the past 12 months, well over 700,000 jobs in our term of office. Everybody on this side of the House is very proud of that record of job creation because it delivers a record of security for Australian families. Of course, that is why workforce and labour force participation was central to our most recent budget - to make sure that we can maximise the opportunities that will flow from the Asian century and from the resources boom, because we do have record terms of trade and we have a massive investment pipeline, which is very important to future job growth. Because we understand that fact, we also understand how important it is to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13 and we understand how important it is to make savings - something not understood by those on that side of the House.                 We also understand how important it is to reform tax, how important it is to get the resource rent tax in place so we can boost national savings and invest in infrastructure. We understand the importance of reform. We understand the importance of putting a price on carbon to our future prosperity. Of course, today you have no better example of a major reform which will lift our productivity and ensure our future prosperity than the announcements that we made today regarding the NBN. Those deals with Telstra and with Optus put us in a position where we can deliver superfast broadband to every corner of our country. This is very important not just to those who live in the city but to those who live in our great regions, because getting away from and giving up horse and buggy telecommunications and moving to superfast broadband is absolutely essential to lifting productivity and our future prosperity.                 So what we are about is getting the economic fundamentals right, making sure we put in place the essential reforms, bringing our budget back to surplus, putting in place superfast broadband and reforming education and training. All of these things are the core of prosperity. Of course, from that side of the House all we see is stunts and slogans. From this side of the House, we are getting the fundamentals right for all Australians.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the question. The answer is very straightforward and it goes to the Bali process. The Bali process is the first regional agreement - out of 13 regions across the world - which demonstrates that you can achieve an outcome in partnership with countries in your region. The Deputy High CommissÂ­ioner for Refugees told both the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and me, when we met on this in Bali a couple of months ago, that all regions of the world are striving towards a comparable agreement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked what achievements have been registered. Firstly, through the process of that Bali framework agreement, we have, for the first time, the support of the international agencies - that is, the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. Secondly, we have within the agreement, also explicitly for the first time, the embrace of the possibility of regional assessment centres. Thirdly, we have the buy-in of more than 30 regional states, if they exercise this option, to cooperate with one another to make it work. In the previous several years of the operation of the Bali process, which was initiated by Alexander Downer as Minister for Foreign Affairs, no such regional framework agreement was ever achieved. That is the advance and we are proud of it.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. She knows how important the National Broadband Network is, particularly for communities in regional Australia. The fact is that today's annÂ­ouncement is good news for Australian consumers and good news for shareholders. The definitive agreement between NBN Co. and Telstra is a binding commitment by Telstra to decommission its copper network and HFC network capability and transfer its customers to NBN. The definitive agreement with Optus will ensure that Optus decomÂ­missions its HFC network and transfers its customers to the NBN. These agreements pave the way for structural separation, building on the work on the legislation that was carried through this chamber.                     The Nats opposite say, 'Communist government.' 'Communist government,' says the Leader of the National Party. There has been a bit of rhetoric recently about extremist parties and a bit of sloganeering around. That might be one of the reasons why those opposite are so opposed to modern telecommunications. If they logged on to the internet, they would be able to see one of their heroes, Lord Monckton -                       Indeed it is related to the question, Mr Speaker, because what the NBN will allow is not just the downloading but the uploading of material - uploading of material at faster speeds and at higher quality. It will improve education, for example. It will be even better, once the NBN reaches full speed, for watching Lord Monckton's speech at the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies convention on 30 June 2011 in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition is of course opening that particular convention in spite of the fact that, if you look on the internet and use modern communications, you can see that Lord Monckton has branded Professor Garnaut a Nazi. But they think that is okay over there.                     Indeed I am doing so, Mr Speaker. Those opposite say this is about communism. Those opposite took a public monopoly, turned it into a private monopoly and called it reform. That was their policy objective. This is what the member for Bradfield described their failure as:                 _ the equivalent of Qantas owning all the airports. The result: competition is weak.                  This is what the member for Wentworth said about the failure of the former government's 20 different plans:                 It was honestly a failure of imagination on our part in government.                 That is what he had to say and he was right. He is right about the mad monk, he is right about Lord Monckton and he is right about this.                     Labor is doing the job properly. We are providing for real -                      I withdraw.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. Labor is doing the job properly: real structural separation, real change and a better deal for regional Australia, for health services and for education. In their own words, they seek to demolish the NBN. What today shows is how out of touch they are with the people currently delivering telecommunications and those who would deliver it in the future.

  In respect of the member's question I would say that it is, unfortunately, simplistic - I wish it could work some other way - to say that the issue of live animal exports and appropriate treatment in abattoirs in Indonesia, following the very graphic and very disturbing footage that Australians saw of the treatment of animals there, can be solved by inspecting an abattoir and saying that standards are okay in that abattoir because -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is a good reminder that you cannot claim to take this issue seriously and then not try to absorb the facts. The facts are that inspecting standards in an abattoir is a vital part of getting the trade back up and running, absolutely - but it is only one part. The other part we have to have in place is the ability to track cattle as they leave Australia and go into Indonesia. The trade does not work on the basis that you move seamlessly from a part of Australia into an Indonesian abattoir. Animals go via feedlots; consÂ­equently, we need a tracking system that works from Australia, through the journey, into the feedlots and into the abattoirs where animals are ultimately dealt with. ConÂ­sequently, we can then ensure that Australian cattle are ending up in the abattoirs where the standards are appropriate.                 I note that the Leader of the National Party has been talking about tracking systems in recent days. He has been extolling the virtues of the National Livestock Identification System -                      If you allow me to finish my sentence, you might actually learn something. I think there is a piece of information that the opposition clearly do not have which is absolutely vital to understanding this problem and resolving it. I suggest to the opposition that they might follow this piece of information. As the Leader of the National Party has been talking about, there is a National Livestock Identification System. The Leader of the National Party knows a bit about that. As a former agriculture minister, he is obviously familiar with it. The system was impÂ­lemented between 2003 and 2004. When the Leader of the National Party was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry he agreed to exempt from that system northern cattle for live export - that is, the cattle that we are talking about and that need to be traced into Indonesia were exempted from the livestock tracking system that the Leader of the National Party is extolling the virtues of. So to get the trade back up and running, given that the cattle we are talking about have not been in that livestock tracking system, we need the two parts. We need the tracking and we need the inspection as to standards, and we are working on both.                 I understand that there are many people who are anxiously waiting for this live animal trade to get back up and running and I am very sympathetic to the circumstances of those who are anxiously waiting, which is why we will be working with them to get this reform done. Australians do not want to see animals treated in the way we saw them treated on the Four Corners show. We will get the system up and running so that we know there are standards and we know where Australian animals are.

Every scientific academy in the world, as well as the World Meteorological Organisation, NASA and the CSIRO - to name just a few - accepts the climate science and recognises that climate change is a real threat to our prosperity and our security. The government respects the science, and that is why we are committed to putting a price on carbon, because it is the most efficient, least-cost way of driving down pollution in our economy and driving investment in clean energy. Too often the public debate on climate change is not informed by rigorous scientific evidence and careful policy analysis. Sometimes it is informed by nothing more than conspiracy theories, alarmism and fear. We have heard that Lord Monckton, who is a well-known climate change denier, is visiting Australia to address a mining conference in Perth. He has recently described Professor Garnaut, an eminent economist advising the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, as a neo-Nazi for saying that the scientific consensus should be respected. This is the same Lord Monckton who has previously stated that climate change is a global communist conspiracy hatched in the UN for the purposes of establishing world government. It is the same Lord Monckton who, along with Alan Jones, David Flint and Andrew Bolt - all fellow travellers of the Leader of the Opposition - has been a participant in the so-called Galileo Movement, a climate change deniers movement. It is the same Lord Monckton who the Leader of the Opposition met the day after releasing his subsidies-for-polluters policy in February 2010. On that occasion the Leader of the Opposition had this to say about his meeting with Lord Monckton:                 I think that you actually come up with better policy if you're prepared to have a discussion not just with people who say yes sir, yes sir, three bags full, sir.                 Lord Monckton has clearly been a key adviser on the coalition subsidies-for-polluters policy, and this is the same Lord Monckton that the Leader of the Opposition will share a platform with at the upcoming mining conference. That conference will probably be subjected to the same demeaning performance that the Leader of the Opposition put on here for the Minerals Council, begging for a TV advertising campaign to be run against carbon pricing and giving commitments that he would bring back Work Choices. This is the same Lord Monckton who the member for Wentworth this morning described as 'a rather sick, vaudeville character who makes more and more outlandish charges in order to get attention for himself'. At least, in part, that statement might be evocative of some of the performances of the Leader of the Opposition and his scare campaigns about carbon pricing. The truth of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition associates himself with extremists - when he addresses rallies, with Pauline Hanson, with the League of Rights, with Lord Monckton - and it is unbefitting of a political leader in this country to hold these views and to have these associations.

  I thank the member for Higgins for her question; I know she is frustrated by the Liberal Party's current political strategy and by the absence of its asking for any ideas. I know she is a member who thinks she could contribute to a policy debate, if the Liberal Party ever had one - and that is a difficulty she faces. I understand that there is cost-of-living pressure on the shoulders of Australians, and that is why we have worked to ease that pressure. First and foremost, as the economy continues to strengthen and moves to running at full capacity, the best thing we can do as a government to ease inflationary pressures and the cost-of-living pressures that come with moving to full capacity is to bring the budget back to surplus, as promised - and we will. The opposition stands for an $11 billion black hole, bigger deficits and bigger debt.                  On the direct cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, we have moved to increase the family tax benefit for parents with teenagers, to pay the childcare tax rebate fortnightly, to assist with the cost of school uniforms and to bring forward the low income tax offset so people get the benefits of more money as a reward for work. Building on other measures that the government has put in place in the recent budget, we have moved to introduce additional measures to assist families. I understand it is still tough and there are cost-of-living pressures, but we are working with Australian families on those cost-of-living pressures.                 On the reforms that the member refers to, I believe it was in the interests of Australian families to rebuild the nation after the summer of floods, and I believe the best way of making sure we paid as we went was to engage in tough budget savings and to have a progressive flood levy which asked upper income earners to pay more. Around half of the flood levy will be paid by people who earn $200,000 a year or more. I believe it is appropriate to ask them for that contribution.                  The member referred to carbon pricing. I stand for helping Australian families; she stands for subsidising big polluters. In a choice between families and polluters, we support families; the Leader of the Opposition and the member who asked the question support polluters. When it comes to the mining tax, which the member also raised with me, we stand for the superannuation earnings of Australians; they stand for big mining companies. We stand for infrastructure for mining communities; they stand for big profits for mining companies. We stand for company tax cuts around the nation; they stand for big profits for mining companies. We stand for small business; they stand for big profits from mining companies. There is a theme emerging here, which is: if required in this place to make a policy choice between helping out the little guy, helping out Australian families and helping out big polluters, big business and big tobacco, the opposition is always on the side of big business, big polluters and big tobacco. We are on the side of Australian families, and we will continue to be.

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. This year's budget delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health reform a priority for this term of government. The budget delivers the largest mental health package ever, with $2.2 billion in new measures.                     The package recognises the diverse impact that mental illness has across the life span. It will build resilient kids. It will support teenagers experiencing mental illness at such an important time in their life. It will improve access to primary care, particularly for hard-to-reach groups in the community. And it will provide intensive and integrated support for those Australians who live with severe and chronic mental illness.                 We are moving quickly to implement these reforms. From 1 July, just next week, a number of new measures will start to flow. I will name just a few. Divisions of general practice will start to receive funds to provide crisis counselling within 24 hours for people at risk of suicide referred by their GP or an emergency department. Divisions will also receive a substantial increase in their base level funding for psychological services targeted at people on low incomes and in regional and rural locations.                 Funding has already started to flow to support up to 1,700 primary schools, expanding the KidsMatter program that helps kids in primary schools build coping skills and build resilience at such a critical age. Lifeline and Beyondblue will also receive additional funding - Lifeline to be able to increase its call capacity from 450,000 calls per year to around 700,000, as well as to be able to take calls from mobiles toll free, and Beyondblue to vastly expand its services for men, including its workplace program, its men's helpline and its stigma campaigns.                 From 1 July Headspace will qualify for huge increases in its core funding, enabling it to expand its services, like outreach to schools and outreach to homeless youth. Having recently announced providers for 10 new services, we will be seeking expressions of interest for the next tranche of 15 new Headspace services in the second half of this calendar year.                 I have already begun discussions with states about ways in which we can work together on implementing our mental health reforms. The next COAG meeting intends to discuss mental health, and we are taking more than $200 million to that meeting to help drive reform in state managed areas like hospital emergency departments and accommodation support. By 1 January we will also have established the first ever National Mental Health Commission to ensure better transparency and better accountability in the system. It will report not to any particular department but to the Prime Minister and to this parliament, reflecting the Prime Minister's strong ownership of this reform package.                 This reform package is comprehensive, it is balanced, it is targeted across the life span and it will make a real difference to those many, many Australians living with mental illness and to their families.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. We have waited a long, long time to hear from the member for Wentworth, and so it is nice to have him back and have him ask a question in this parliament. I did think, as question time went on, that it was more likely than not that the opposition, trapped as it is in its relentless negativity, would allow the major milestone of today's announcement with Telstra to absolutely pass it by, because of course it is not interested in a vision for the nation's future or the part that superfast broadband can play in that vision. But the member for Wentworth has ridden to the rescue and asked a question on this important topic.                 Unfortunately, the member for Wentworth is mistaken in his question, so next time he gets to ask one perhaps he could ask one that is better pitched than this. As the member for Wentworth really knows, I believe, the National Broadband Network is developing the infrastructure, it will be a wholesale provider and there will be retail competition based on the broadband network - so retailers will be competing in order to get people's business. Those of us who believe in free markets and in economic theory know from first principles that if you can get competition into the market then you will get lower prices, you will get more choice and you will get better services, and of course with the National Broadband Network you will get faster speeds.                     As I was saying to the member for Wentworth and to the House, competition obviously gives us the benefits of the greatest competition on price, the greatest competition on service and the greatest number of options for consumers, and of course superfast broadband gives us the benefit of speed. The member for Wentworth has raised with me the digital divide and I say to him, yes, I am desperately concerned by the digital divide, and one of the reasons we have gone down the path of creating NBN Co. to bring superfast broadband around the country is that, if we had allowed the private sector to simply respond, it would have responded in limited parts of the country, the upper income areas where there were most likely to be the greatest returns, and there would have been large parts of the country - in regional Australia but also on outer urban fringes - where people would not have the benefits of this technology. Being very familiar with the nonprovision of broadband in my own electorate in Melbourne's west, I tell him that we would not have seen the kind of provision of broadband to those areas which is necessary to close the digital divide.                 If you cared about equity and you cared about Australians getting fair access to broadband, you would endorse the government's plan for the National Broadband Network. If you cared about equity and cared about the tyranny of distance suffered by people who live in regional Australia, you would endorse the government's plan for the National Broadband Network. If you cared about lower prices, faster speeds, greater competition and more choice, you would endorse the government's plan for the National Broadband Network. I think the member for Wentworth is trying to inch his way towards actually endorsing the government's plan in his public statements, but he has been told by the Leader of the Opposition to destroy the NBN as part of the opposition's relentless negativity. I know the member is uncomfortable with that position, but with the current Leader of the Opposition that is the position he finds himself in.

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She knows that instead of the slurs and stunts that we see from those opposite this government is delivering to Australian families and to senior Australians and that we are also delivering on our election commitments.                 In the last fortnight we have delivered legislation through this parliament that will see Australian families and seniors receive the following from 1 July: for seniors, the new work bonus delivered by this government to help Australian pensioners keep more of their pension when they take on some part-time work; new baby bonus payment arrangements so that parents will be able to receive that little bit more money up-front when they need to purchase items like a pram or a cot; more flexible arrangements for families - those receiving family tax benefits will get better advance payment arrangements so that if they face unexpected costs, like needing to fix their car when it breaks down, they will be able to do so; and new requirements of families receiving income support to help make sure that their children get the necessary health checks done before they start school. Also starting on 1 July is the extension to the education tax refund, making sure that we help cover the cost of school uniforms. This too is delivering another election commitment. Through the new A Better Start for Children with a Disability program -                      Even this item is interjected on, with more slurs from those opposite. From 1 July, this government will enable those families who have a child with a disability to access up to $12,000 in early intervention funding for their child. All of these election commitments are being delivered by this government.                 As I said yesterday in parliament, 1 July is a very significant milestone for our Paid Parental Leave scheme. From 1 July government funded paid parental leave will be delivered by employers for most babies who are born from that date. As we on this side of the parliament know, paid parental leave helps make sure that parents keep connected with their workplaces after they have a new baby. It was never delivered by those opposite, but now 65,000 families are benefiting from our Paid Parental Leave scheme.                 Of course it is this government that is also delivering for parents with teenagers. That legislation, too, has gone through the parliament in the last fortnight, and from 1 January next year this government will deliver extra support to families with teenagers. It was never delivered by those opposite. All they want to do is deliver slurs and stunts; we will deliver for Australian families.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: there is a little edge of desperation about all of this, isn't there? The Leader of the Opposition has been caught out misleading the Australian community. He has been here in Parliament House and right around the nation claiming to anyone who will listen that carbon pricing will apply to petrol at petrol bowsers - that families or small businesses going to fill up the tank will be paying a carbon price on the petrol they put in their motor vehicles. He said it here in parliament and he said it around the nation.                 The decent thing for the Leader of the Opposition to do today would be to acknÂ­owledge that he was wrong, to acknowledge that he went out of his way, with no facts and no truthfulness, to try to scare the Australian people. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition, having been caught out once, is unlikely to do the decent thing. Instead, he will be trying to move his scare campaign to the next stage. I anticipate that over the coming weeks we will hear more and more ridiculous scares from the Leader of the Opposition. I say to Australians who hear these words of fear from the Leader of the Opposition: he was dead wrong about petrol, and every word he says over the next few weeks, with his next round of scare campaigns, will be dead wrong as well. Petrol is not in the carbon-pricing scheme. It will not have a carbon price applied to it now or in the future.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that wonderfully perceptive question and I thank her for her advocacy on behalf of her community in this place. Soon we will be in a position to announce full details of the carbon-pricing package which, as a Labor government, we have been working hard on. We have been working hard, as a Labor government, in order to tackle climate change - a huge challenge for our nation's future. As we have gone about the challenge of tackling climate change and cutting carbon pollution, we have done it guided by our Labor values. Guided by our Labor values, we have been working to ensure that nine out of 10 households get assistance through tax cuts or payment increases or a combination of both, that the vast majority of those households will not pay a cent as a result of pricing carbon and that more than three million low-income households will get the benefit of a 20 per cent buffer. We know that their budgets are tight and we want to make sure that, in tight budgets, they have 20 per cent of reassurance, that they have been assisted above and beyond the impact of a carbon price.                  We also have wanted to take the decision to not put a carbon price on petrol because we understand that, in many parts of the country, people have got no choice but to get into their car and to drive their car to get places. It is true of the outer urban electorate that I represent, it is true of the outer urban electorate that the member for La Trobe represents and it is true of country and regional Australia, as represented in this place by so many good Labor members. For example, last week I was with the member for Lingiari, a place where you have got no alternative but to jump in your car and drive. So we have determined that, because of the needs of families in outer urban places and in regional Australia, there should not be a carbon price on petrol. I also thank the member for New England for his advocacy on behalf of regional Australia and his community as we have gone about pricing carbon. We have done it in a Labor way, and doing it in a Labor way means that we should look at the alternatives that are being advocated in this place. Unfortunately, the alternative is a $720 per year direct slug on families. The Liberal party's position was not always like this.                   The member for Cowan                    then left the chamber.                     I refer the parliament to this report of the former Howard government on emissions trading - the emissions trading scheme the former Howard government wanted to introduce and which, if it had introduced it as heralded by this report, would have started on 1 July this year. That emissions trading scheme of the Howard government would have had a carbon price on petrol. That is, the Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister in a government that would have put a carbon price on petrol from 1 July this year. That is the truth from this report.                   Instead, the Leader of the Opposition has been out trying to scare Australian families. It is time for him to do the decent thing, to go back to Queanbeyan and to say to the people at the fresh food market that he was wrong when he said to them that petrol would go up, to go back to Moorebank and say to the community there that he was wrong when he said that petrol would go up. He should stand at the dispatch box and say in this parliament that he was wrong when he said petrol would go up. That would be the decent thing to do. We await to see whether or not the Leader of the Opposition is a decent man who will do it.

  In answer to the member's question I would say this: of course I understand that people use electricity for all sorts of daily household purposes, which is why, as we put a price on carbon, we will assist Australian households. Nine out of 10 households will get tax cuts or increases in payments or a combination of both. The vast majority of those households will not see carbon pricing cost them a cent and lower income households will have the benefit of a 20 per cent buffer. It has been referred to in the media as a battler's buffer - that is, they will get 20 per cent more than the impact of carbon pricing on them. I understand that Australian families are struggling with energy bills that have been going up and up without a carbon price. We need to give the electricity generation sector, the distribution sector and the energy sector certainty so that they invest for the future and particularly invest in the clean energy sources of the future.                 The member who is showing a concern about cost of living questions may want to think about the alternative. People will see their energy bills go up and the Leader of the Opposition will be ripping $720 a year out of their family budget. That is what the plan of the Leader of the Opposition is: to put a tax on Australian families and give that money to subsidise big polluters. We, on the other hand, are going to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change by putting a tax on the big polluters, by charging them a price on carbon and using the money raised to assist Australian families who are often struggling to meet big costs like electricity prices. I say to the member he may want to think how his constituents will react to the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip $720 off them per year.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Of course, as the House has heard today and as the Prime Minister made clear yesterday, petrol will be exempt from the government's carbon price. What that means is that families, tradesÂ­people and small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a petrol price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. That is a very important commitment that runs completely contrary to the scare campaign that the Leader of the Opposition has been running for month after month after month.                 The Leader of the Opposition has had a number of things to say in the scare campaign. He said on one occasion that the impact on the cost of living would be unimaginable. He has repeatedly said that the carbon price will put 6Â½c a litre on the price of petrol just for starters. For week after week after week, the Leader of the OpposÂ­ition has gone out and completely misrepÂ­resented this position to the Australian community. It is time to own up to it and time to apologise. He has claimed more than 20 times that the cost of petrol will go up. He is wrong today, he was wrong then and he should apologise to the community for his deliberate misrepresentation.                 A scare campaign is always fuelled by misrepresentation and misinformation and it can never ever stand up to the facts. That is why, as the government finalises more details of our plans to put a price on carbon pollution, the Leader of the Opposition will get more and more hysterical. Chicken Little is going to get more and more shrill as all of his misrepresentation is revealed for what it is - a scare campaign.                 On this front, last Friday there was quite an extraordinary outburst at economists. It was essentially: what would leading econoÂ­mists in Australia know about economics compared to the Leader of the Opposition? That was an extraordinary attack on economists in this country for indicating what is widely held and understood - that is, a market mechanism for pricing carbon is the most efficient way of reducing pollution across our economy. He does not like economists, does not like scientists and takes his scientific advice from the One Nation website. This is a completely disreputable campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition.                 In the face of all this, the challenge that climate change represents for our country, the Leader of the Opposition is content to see pollution rise and continue to add to the problem that we have. He rejects market mechanisms as efficient ways to reduce pollution across our economy. He will slug the budget instead with the subsidies-for-polluters policy. It will cost $30 billion -                      to 2020. It is going to cost $720 per household for the subsidies-for-polluters policy. The Leader of the Opposition is committed to claw back the pension increases, take back the tax cuts, claw back the benefits for families. He is going to take them all back by repealing the carbon price legislation. Our country faces a serious significant challenge with the threat of climate change. As a political figure in this country, it is hard to imagine a more irresponsible misrepresentative campaign than that that has been conducted by the Leader of the Opposition over recent months and in coming days it will be exposed.

  I would like to thank the member for Wannon for his question. All fuel - including petrol, diesel and LPG - for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles will not be subject to the carbon price. The member for Wannon will also know that in the last four months the Leader of the Opposition no fewer than 20 times has said that the cost of petrol will rise. This just exposes what has really been going on in this country in the political debate -                      We have seen in the last four months the Leader of the Opposition trying to run a strategy which says that fear will triumph over hope. He has been trying to make it very clear that there will be a carbon price on petrol for passenger motor vehicles and for light motor vehicles.                 We have also agreed that there should be -                      In terms of the question that was asked, I was asked about Allen Transport. In terms of the trucks that were spoken about, there was not the specification that the member for Murray says there was. Perhaps if she had written the member for Wannon's question it might have gone a different way. But returning to the question that was asked about a carbon price on petrol, we have been very clear in the last 24 hours that there will not be a price on carbon put on petrol for passenger motor vehicles and for light commercial vehicles.                 In terms of the rest of the detail of the carbon package, I know that the opposition is greatly interested in what the price on carbon should be. In the very near future more detail will emerge. But let us go back to what has been put on the record already. We have agreed to a Productivity Commission review on fuel excise. We have said that there will be a Productivity Commission review on fuel excise. It is anticipated that this review will include an examination of the merits of the regime based on carbon content or energy content of fuels. The Henry review looked at this in some detail. It recommended replacÂ­ing the revenue raised through fuel excise with direct charges for road use. The review noted that this would actually result in a reduction in fuel tax paid.                 I am not going to pre-empt the recÂ­ommendations of the Productivity ComÂ­mission's review, which has not even started, but let us be very clear when it comes to fuel excise policy in this place. The government is not afraid of good policy. That is why as recently as two weeks ago we finished the job which the opposition should have done. I know that Mr Minchin is no longer here, but he recognised that for excises in the fuel tax policy it was important to include alternative fuels such as LPG. We finished the job which should have been done by those opposite many years ago. If they actually want to engage in a proper policy debate then they will have to do more than just oppose ideas.

  I thank the member for his question and understand that he would be concerned about the circumstances of the live cattle industry, so let me just go through the various things he has asked me. I will start with the last point first because I think it is very important.                     I was responding to the last question first because I think it is very important to clear up any misapprehensions there may be about this matter. There is no technical impediment to Indonesia granting permits during the forthcoming three-month period. The course that Indonesia has adopted to date is to not issue import permits to any country. So this is not just about Australia. It has taken that decision in relation to import permits for any nation. The form of words that the member used in his question was that this definitely means that Australia will not be in that market for three months. That is not true. We are obviously working strongly with Indonesia, and with industry here at home, to get the trade up and running again.                 My aim, as Prime Minister, has been to resume this trade as soon as possible, making sure that we can address the very real animal welfare issues which were exposed on the Four Corners program and which horrified Australians, including those in the cattle industry. I have had the opportunity to meet with them personally on more than one occasion and everyone that I have met has said as their first sentence to me that they do not want to see their animals treated like that and they were horrified by that footage too.                 We want to get this trade up and running as soon as possible, having ensured that the animal welfare standards are appropriate. In order to do that, we need to be able to track and trace where animals from Australian farms go - that is, we need to be able to trace them from the farm, through the journey, on the boat, to the feedlot, to the abattoir - and we need to assure ourselves -                      that the standards in the abattoir are appropriate. We are engaged in that work right now.                 On the diplomatic strategy and how this work is being done, the government across the board is engaged in this - the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Trade, and, obviously, I am involved as Prime Minister - and we are pursuing a diplomatic strategy with the best possible advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We will continue to do that. I do not believe that it is appropriate for me to in any way respond to domestic politics here in this regard. The best thing is to have the most productive working relationship with Indonesia, and that is what I intend to do.                 On the actions taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the minister has been working hard on this very difficult question. There are, of course, some extreme views in this debate. There are some people who basically do not believe we should kill animals for food and there are some people who say, 'Resume the trade, no matter what,' but the vast majority of people, I believe, are in the centre of those two poles and are saying, 'Let's resume the trade when the animal welfare issues are right.' But, given the vast spread of opinion here, it is of no surprise really that the minister for agriculture has got the occasional critique from some involved in the debate. However, he is working hard to get this resolved, as we are across government. I thank the member for his question.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question because putting a price on carbon pollution is absolutely important for future prosperity and for future environmental sustainability. We on this side of the House accept the proposition that climate change is real. Just about every reputable scientist believes that climate change is real and, indeed, the Howard government even believed that climate change is real - which is why it believed in putting a price on carbon pollution.                 All of the leading scientists, particularly those who came out in the last few weeks, make it very clear that climate change is real, that we are causing it and that we do need to act now. We need to act now because we are in the critical decade. To delay action will mean greater costs and a greater adjustment into the future. That is why economists and business groups accept that the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action. That has been accepted since the Stern report came down three or four years ago. It is accepted amongst economists that the least-cost way of doing this is by putting a price on carbon pollution.                 That is why we had, in the last couple of weeks, 13 respected Australian economists making that point from most of our reputable businesses in the country. We have Australian business - the Australian Industry Group, the BCA - all arguing for a price on carbon. Only last week we had the CEO of NAB who has said that a price on carbon will drive certainty, it will drive investment. This proposition is also accepted by our largest mining, gas and energy companies.                     Last week, we had the Chairman of Gloucester Coal, Mr James MacKenzie, who made this point about the coal industry:                 We are talking about $1 a tonne in the coal industry. It is not something that is going to affect the economics of the coal industry...                 That is why companies like Shell, BP, GE, AGL, Santos, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Origin Energy have all come out in favour of a market price. They all accept that a price on carbon is the way to go to secure our future prosperity.                     We are going about this in the Labor way. We are going about this by providing assistance for households. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts and increased payments to help with the cost of living. We will provide transitional assistance to industry.                  So what does the Leader of the Opposition do in the face of everything that the scientists are saying, everything that the economists are saying, everything that senior corporate leaders are saying? He simply ignores the scientists and prefers to take the advice of Lord Monckton. Nothing more could demonÂ­strate what a climate change sceptic he is than that fact. When he got on the wrong side of this, he decided last week when he was at the economics conference in Melbourne to start attacking all of the economists who agree with pricing carbon.                  We know something about this Leader of the Opposition: he just likes to come out swinging all of the time and he does not care who he hits. Last week he started taking it out on leading Australian economists who had the temerity to argue for a price on carbon. So he ignores business, he ignores economists and we saw in the House last week and again today that he is going to ignore his own plebiscite. He will not take any notice of business, he will not take any notice of economists and he will not take any notice of scientists. All this just shows how dangerous and unfit for high office he is.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She, as did everyone on this side of the House, knew how important it was to fight Work Choices and replace it with Fair Work Australia. I am asked what the impact has been of this important change which we have made since coming to office and I can say this: it has been fantastic for jobs. Some 740,000 jobs have been created since we came to office -                       - with the prospect of another 500,000 jobs. There has been a significant lessening of industrial disputes, almost a halving of them, since we came to office. There has been important wages growth without inflationary impact. There are now the greatest number of people on enterprise bargaining in the history of this country - and that is important because it is focusing economic activity at the job level, the plant level - and there has been smarter bargaining as well. There have been some important breakthroughs in which superannÂ­uation has become an important part of the bargaining process. So not only has the impact been a much fairer system - because gone has been the threat to people's wages and conditions and the ability to sack them at the whim of the employer, replaced now by a requirement to bargain in good faith - but also a system that more than ever suits the economy and the circumstances it is going through now. It is an economy in transition and there is a requirement to understand those different transitory phases and to have a wages system and an industrial relations system that works.                 When we talked about introducing the system, we were told by those who now sit opposite that the sky would fall in - wages would be out of control, industrial disputes would be up and we would see all manner of job losses. Just as they are spreading fear today about pricing carbon, so too in those days did they spread fear about the changes we were going to make to Work Choices.                  I am also asked in this question: what are the challenges to us in continuing to implement this? The biggest challenge would be if there were a return of a Liberal government to power at the federal level because, for the Liberals, Work Choices is in their DNA. You only have to look at New South Wales and Victoria to see where the premiers there are heading. There is also a cacophony of members in this parliament pining for a return to the days of Work Choices - the member for Curtin, the memÂ­ber for Wentworth, the member for Goldstein, the member for Higgins, the member for Moncrieff and the member Mayo have all weighed in.                    But where has the Leader of the Opposition been in this debate? Try as they might, the media cannot get him to talk about it. He is muzzling his own frontbench, keeping them off television programs and avoiding those programs himself. But when he, himself, was asked what he is going to do, he said, 'Wait until the field evidence comes in.' The field evidence is in. This has been a return to a better system. What we know about the other side is that they are united on returning to Work Choices. They are united on the IR front; they are divided on the PR front - how they come clean with the Australian public. Labor will resist the return to Work Choices because a return would be bad for the Australian people and this economy.

  I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. As the Assistant Treasurer said before, all fuel, including petrol, diesel and LPG for passenger motor vehicles and light commÂ­ercial vehicles, will not be subject to a carbon price. He went on to make the point that, when it came to heavy vehicles, we would be revealing further details when we have completed our decisions on the emissions trading scheme. He made that very clear as well.                 I would like to say a few things about carbon pricing, and I will refer those comments to rural and regional Queensland in particular. No part of our country will benefit more greatly from a price on carbon than regional and rural Queensland because no part of our country will be more affected by the impacts of dangerous climate change than parts of regional Queensland, which will feel those impacts particularly in agriculture. It is imperative that all of us in this parliament do something about carbon pollution and put in place a solution for the future which secures the environment for our great state, including regional areas but not just regional areas - there is the Great Barrier Reef, for example.                  There is a rolled gold case to put a price on carbon if you are a Queenslander. The area that the member for Maranoa asks about is a great coal producing region. We on this side of the House see a bright future for coal in this country. We understand that we need a price on carbon to drive the investment in renewable energy and cleaner -                      Mr Speaker, I was asked about the town of Wandoan, which I know. I was asked about that region. Not only is it a great agricultural region; it produces coal as well. People who live there depend for their living on one or the other of those industries. They will receive the assistance which we will put in place for a carbon price. The households there will receive through our scheme additional assistance in terms of tax cuts, in terms of pension increases and also in terms of family payments to compensate for the price impact of a price on carbon. They will all benefit from that - but not only that. It is a great coal producing region and no industry has a greater stake in putting a price on carbon than the coal industry. If we do not move in this area, they will be subject to trade barriers in a carbon constrained world.                  The coal industry in this country has a very bright future and it will be even brighter if we price carbon, if we make sure that we drive investment not just in renewable energy but particularly in carbon capture and storage - to get the innovation, to make the future of the industry even brighter and the future brighter in Wandoan for all of the Queenslanders and Australians who live there.

  We in this House can all have confidence that the fundamentals in our economy are strong and that our future prospects are bright. We have low unemployment, we have record terms of trade and we have an unprecedented pipeline of investment. In particular, as ABARES shows, $430 billion is in the pipeline for resources.                  This investment boom will over time stretch our economic capacity, and that is why it is critical to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. That is why we are delivering such a significant fiscal consolÂ­idation. This has been noted in particular by the Reserve Bank in recent times. It is also why we are concerned to build a bigger and better workforce so that all Australians can participate in the opportunities which will flow from the mining boom. This is why the budget was welcomed not just by the Reserve Bank but also by private-sector economists, business groups, unions and community groups. This is why it was so important that the budget pass the House last Thursday - to deliver the economic investments which are so important for our future prosperity and to put in place the savings we needed in that budget to bring our budget back to surplus. So what passed in this House were also key savings measures. These were part of something like 150 bills which have passed through the House of Representatives during the period of this Gillard government. It is a very substantial achievement which goes to the core of securing our future prosperity. We are concerned with continuing to deliver that, but there are some risks to this outlook from the approach of those opposite, particularly the shadow Treasurer. They are still insisting on holding up something like $6 billion worth of critical savings, and that is on top of the $7 billion in budget savings that they have opposed in this House.                 We had some revelations about a possible opposition economic policy last week. They came out and said that they were going to give a new round of tax cuts. Of course, we do not know how those tax cuts are going to be delivered because we have not seen the savings to deliver them. We have no idea where they are going to come from. In the same breath, the shadow Treasurer said seriously that he was going to bring down interest rates as well. I do not know how he gets to a position of having a lower surplus, opposing savings in this House and bringing down interest rates. I think the stupidity of this was evident in a press conference the shadow Treasurer gave just before question time. His main point was that we must take pressure off interest rates by spending less. How do you spend less and give substantial tax cuts without indicating where the savings are going to come from?                 Of course, when he was challenged by the journalist he walked off and had a hissy fit. Just before question time he was questioned about how all of this was going to be done and he could not answer the question and walked away in a huff. Finally, he was asked by one of the journalists about his cardboard cut-out antics here a few weeks ago and he just stormed off. None of that is a substitute for a fully funded and fully assessed economic policy. It just proves how unfit for high office all of those opposite are.

  He is a glutton for punishment. The shadow Treasurer asked me about the tourism industry. There is no industry in this country which is going to be a greater beneficiary of dealing with dangerous climate change than the tourism industry. Its very existence in my home state depends upon the survival of the Great Barrier Reef.                     The question from the shadow Treasurer is just part of their irresponsible and continuing scare campaign. Those opposite specialise in talking our economy down by making outrageous statements and claims which are all completely inaccurate and not based on any facts whatsoever. You cannot run economic policy if you ignore the facts, but that is what the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer want to do. The Australian people see right through that crew opposite. They know that so much is being said by those opposite which is absolutely untrue and it reflects very poorly on all of them.

  I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question. She knows that the Labor governÂ­ment are delivering substantial benefits that are helping families and seniors, while all we get from those opposite is spin and no substance at all. Since last Friday Australian pensioners can now receive the new work bonus which will help them keep more of the pension when they take on some part-time work. Since last Friday Australian families will be able to get access to an expanded education tax refund that will now include school uniforms. Since last Friday there are now new baby bonus payment arrangements to help with the upfront purchases that parents need to make when a new baby comes into the family, such as paying for a new cot or a pram. Families will also be able to access improved family tax benefit payment arrangements to help them meet unexpected costs, such as the cost of fixing their cars. These are real, tangible benefits for Australian families and pensioners. These are reforms of substance, and each and every one of them was delivered by this Labor government. And from last Friday Australian parents are now also receiving the government funded paid parental leave through their employer, and this helps parents keep their connection with their workplace. Just on Friday the Prime Minister and I were very pleased to go to McDonalds in Werribee where we met new mum, Mia, with her baby, Sienna. Mia is about to go back to work after having had her paid parental leave. Of course, she has been very pleased to have the time off with her new baby and has also benefited from keeping the connection with her workplace. She is now very pleased to go back to work. This demonstrates that our paid parental leave has been good for families and continues to be good for business.                  Also, from Friday parents who are returning to work after having time off looking after their children will be able to receive the childcare rebate fortnightly, which of course will help them balance their family budgets. It was this Labor governÂ­ment that increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent, which existed under the coalition, to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. All of these changes have been delivered by this Labor government. And all that we hear from the opposition on these issues is the very, very large bill of $4.5 billion that this Leader of the Opposition wants to pay for their paid parental leave policy. Although I read in the paper today that the Leader of the Nationals told the Leader of the Opposition he should:                 Just get rid of the bloody thing.                 What is it to be? Is the Leader of the OpposÂ­ition going to get rid of their paid parental leave policy or leave Australians with a huge bill?

  I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. On the question of petrol for families and small businesses, and light commercial vehicles, I said 'now and into the future' petrol will not be covered by the carbon pricing scheme - now or in the future. The member for Hasluck might want to note that point because that is not what he said in his question but that is what I said in this parliament and outside: 'now and into the future' - and I am referring to that part of the question that dealt with household petrol.                  On other issues associated with carbon pricing, the member for Hasluck should wait, as should the opposition in general, to see the full scheme. To date, in guessing what the scheme has in it, the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition have gone out and misled the community, and not told them the truth. For months and months and months, the Leader of the Opposition has been saying to anyone who would listen, including in this parliament, that petrol would go up by 6.5c -                      I was asked a question where on more than one occasion the member for Hasluck said, 'In relation to the Prime Minister's statement that petrol would not be covered by the carbon price for now.' He said that twice. I am entitled to clarify in this parliament that what I have said here and publicly is that the carbon price will not apply to petrol now or in the future. Members of the opposition have been out there for months and months and months trying to scare Australian families with a false claim that petrol was going up by 6.5c a litre. I will not have them now going out there for months and months again trying to scare Australian families that somehow a carbon price is going to apply to petrol in the future. It is not honest. It is not right. It was implied by the member's question and I correct it now because it would be an irresponsible fear campaign, only pursued by people determined to be dishonest with the electorate.                  In relation to the rest of carbon pricing in response to the member for Hasluck, each and every statement that members opposite have made about carbon pricing have been grossly irresponsible and wrong. On a number of occasions I have come into this parliament and said to members opposite that every time they ask a question with a figure in it, they have made that figure up. Having committed that error month after month, day after day, week after week, making figures up in order to pursue a scare campaign, the responsible thing for the member for Hasluck to do now, before he makes any assumptions about how carbon pricing will work, is to wait until he gets the full details of the scheme. Also, the member for Hasluck should be out in his electorate telling every family he meets that his policy and the Leader of the Opposition's policy is to rip $720 a year off them. That is a fact.

  I thank the member for Page for her question because I doubt that there is anyone in this House with more knowledge of Burma than the member for Page. When I was recently in Rangoon the depth of the longstanding friendship with Aung San Suu Kyi which the member for Page has had over more than a decade was clear. I commend her engagement over a long period of time.                 The Australian people and the Australian government over the last couple of decades have focused on, legitimately, the continuing suppression of human rights in Burma. Recent history speaks for itself: crackdowns on democracy back in '88, in 1990 -                       - the regime then ignoring democratic elections, Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 of the last 22 years, and of course the brutal suppression of the monks back in 2007. In the last several months we have seen some change - I do not wish to overstate it - on the part of the Burmese government. First, of course, we welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi herself from house arrest. Second, after decades of military rule, we have for the first time, at least nominally, a new civilian government. Third, the president of that civilian government has made a statement on the future directions of democracy, economic reform, health, education and the rest. These are limited changes but they are changes nonetheless, and it was on that basis that I went to Burma in the course of the last several days. It was the first visit by an Australian foreign minister for about a decade, since Mr Downer went there in 2002, and the first visit to Burma by a Western foreign minister since the recent political change there.                 In discussions with the Burmese president I very much indicated that the first requirement of the international community is the release of more than 2,000 prisoners of conscience still held in incarceration across Burma. This must be the next and most critical step. If the Burmese government takes that step it will have an immediate transformational effect on the international community's engagement with the governÂ­ment. But, beyond that, more is needed: greater freedom of political operation for Aung San Suu Kyi herself, the National League for Democracy and, on top of that, other democratic forces and parties. What is also required is the peaceful resolution of Burma's longstanding ethnic conflicts within the country.                 I also spoke to the Burmese president and the foreign minister about our engagement in the reduction of poverty in that country, in health and education and in other areas such as food security and agriculture. Australia now stands as the second largest donor to Burma, after the United Kingdom. That is because in Burma we have the poorest country in Asia and therefore something like one-quarter of its population of 60 million living below the poverty line. We in Australia are doing our bit.                 I also spent time, together with the member for Page, with Aung San Suu Kyi herself, and can I say to all members of the House who have stood in solidarity with her over the course of the last couple of decades that she wanted me to express to all members of this House her appreciation for the support she has received from this parliament over a long period of time. That is not a partisan comment; it reflects the attitude of those opposite as well.                 She also indicated that when she visits rural Burma in the days ahead she expects security to be provided to her and guaranteed by the Burmese government. We reiterate that call. Notwithstanding a recent letter to her from the home affairs minister warning her about her movements, she has indicated her preparedness to engage in political dialogue with the regime. We will continue to engage with Burma into the future.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in this issue. The government's counter -                      Mr McCLELLAND:                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government's counterterrorism white paper identified home grown terrorism as the primary terrorist risk facing Australians and Australian interests and the figures in that respect are instructive. Since 2001 38 people have been charged with terrorism offences in Australia and, while some are yet to face the courts for decision, 37 of those 38 are Australian citizens and, in fact, 21 of the 38 were born in Australia. Just recently the Director-General of Security has made a speech outlining the extent to which individuals are attracted to violent extremist ideologies in many countries, including Australia. While their numbers are small, there is a disproportionate risk to Australians from that small number. So accordingly a comprehensive counterterrorism response necessarily means having a program to counter violent extremism.                 In that context, we have been working in partnership with a number of communities to identify extremist elements and to assist vulnerable people to resist the influence of those who would seek to encourage them down that path. The program that has been developed has been informed by expert analysis and advice as to the risk factors and also in terms of developing appropriate strategies. Essentially, that advice is that there is no single risk factor but by and large it does involve young men in particular becoming disconnected and disengaged from not only the mainstream community but also their own communities. That, in turn, makes them vulnerable to be exploited by those who would seek to encourage them down the path of violence.                 The first round of countering violent extremism measures was announced last year. They focused on youth mentoring, and today the government has announced an additional $1.7 million for 22 programs that focus on building community resilience. These programs are particularly interesting. They range from programs to communicate with youths who have been directly exposed to a violent extremist message through to local footy teams who are working with their local communities' youths from all backÂ­grounds - to build partnerships and team building and an understanding of different views and, we hope, enduring friendships - through to teacher education and, indeed, development of a national curriculum as well as some grants to those who would develop websites and communication platforms to assist in countering the violent extremist message that can be communicated over the internet.                 Could I also congratulate those local governments that have been involved in a number of programs aimed at breaking down stereotyping and at empowering people to resist violent extremism. The government is working in partnership with communities and I can express our appreciation that they have been prepared to recognise the risks and they have been prepared to bring forward such innovative ideas to address the location and specific circumstances of those comÂ­munities. While these are simple and small measures, they are practical measures and we hope they will make the world just that bit safer for our children and grandchildren in the years ahead.

  I have outlined, and so has the Assistant Treasurer, those that would be exempt. I am afraid the members who are so serious about running their scare campaign have got a little while to wait yet to get all the detail, and I will be happy to talk to them about it when we have finalised the scheme. In the meantime they will continue with their outrageous scare campaigns and distortions, but I do not believe that the Australian people respect this sort of outrageous approach.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question because I know that, unlike the member for Dickson, he is interested in services that are being provided to his electorate. I can inform the House that two brand-new services became available for people across the country from 1 July, last week. Our telehealth services are particularly for rural and regional Australia but also for those living in outer urban electorates like that represented by the member for Deakin. In addition to our telehealth services, the GP after-hours hotline became available for the first time at six o'clock on Friday night. I can inform the House that already 1,300 families and consumers have used that service and been assisted by GPs who are on hand to provide them with medical advice and information in the middle of the night or on Sunday afternoon when their GP services are closed.                 The Prime Minister and I were lucky enough to be on hand to sit in on one of the first telehealth conferences. The Prime Minister was in Darwin, in the GP superclinic in Palmerston, with a GP and with a patient, Mary. I was with a specialist dermatologist in Adelaide. Using new technology, with of course the new MBS payments, we were able to see how a consultation could occur. It took under 10 minutes. With the use of technology it meant that the patient in Darwin, instead of having to travel thousands of kilometres there and back to Adelaide to see a dermatologist or to wait weeks or months to have a simple consultation, was able to have her sore leg properly diagnosed. The GP was able to write the script and she was able to get along straight away with that treatment - a simple thing that could not occur if we were not in government because those opposite (1) are trying to pull down the NBN and (2) have opposed our investments in telehealth and opposed our investments in GP superclinics. I was also able last week to visit with the members for Chifley, Greenway, Reid and Parramatta, and with seniors and families in their electorates who want to be able to use the GP after-hours service. Those families would probably be very surprised to know that the Liberal opposition have said they will slash funding for those services.                 I have not had a question from the member for Dickson for 97 weeks, yet they can go to the campaign and say that they will cut back these services that are already providing support right across the country. If you live in rural and regional Australia, a specialist has suddenly become closer and easier to access because of our government's $620 million investments. If you are a family that has a sick child in the middle of the night you can now get a GP on the end of the line, but if the Liberal Party were in government they would be closing down those services.                 It is about time the Liberal Party came into this House and actually asked us a question on another matter of policy. While we are getting on with delivering health services and delivering health reform, all they are doing is opposing every investment and making it harder and harder for families that need medical services to get access to them. It is about time the member for Dickson started doing some work.

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In answer to the question by the Leader of the Opposition I can confirm that the carbon price package will be announced on Sunday. On the question of parliamentary scrutiny, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the problem for him with this question is that he does not use question time or parliament for parliamentary scrutiny; he uses it for hurling slogans and abuse.                     The evidence of that, of course, is that 50 question times have been interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition pulling his stunt of the day. This means that he has lost the benefit of 136 questions as a result of pulling his stunts - his suspensions and interruptions - each and every day.                     The last thing the Leader of the Opposition ever uses this parliament for is proper scrutiny.                   The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                   The member for Indi then left the chamber.                     I can certainly say to the parliament and to the Australian people that there will be no lack of scrutiny of this package. I will be out day after day, following Sunday, taking every question from every Australian family who wants to ask me one. I will be travelling to all parts of the country, prepared to take questions from Australian families about how we are pricing carbon, what we are doing to assist families and what we are doing to protect jobs. I will be wearing out my shoe leather literally around the country, making sure that Australian families who want answers about the carbon-pricing package get those answers.

  I thank the member for her question and I thank her too for her advocacy on behalf of the Central Coast community that she represents in this parliament. She does a great job raising their needs and concerns. Living in that very beautiful part of the world, she also understands that we as a nation need to tackle climate change and to cut carbon pollution, that the most efficient way to do that is to price carbon, that pricing carbon is the right thing to do by our environment and that it is the right thing to do by our economy so that we have the clean energy jobs of the future.                 By world standards, we have a very carbon pollution intensive economy. Per head of population we generate more carbon pollution than even the people of the United States. That means that, in transforming our economy to a clean energy future, we have a big journey to go, and that is why it makes sense to start that journey soon.                 Of course, we have a strong economy. We have come out of the global financial crisis with an economy that is the envy of the world, and the right time to act on a big reform is when your economy is strong. I understand that many Australian families, even whilst the economy is strong, do not necessarily see the benefits of that strong economy in their own lives, which is why we will support Australian families as we make this transition to a clean energy future, with nine out of 10 households getting tax cuts and payment increases to assist them through.                 And, because we want to work with Australian families as we transition to a clean energy future, we have determined that carbon pricing will not apply at the petrol bowser. We understand that many Australian families have very little choice but to jump in their car to get places and we will not have carbon pricing apply directly to petrol.                  That does mean that I have made a different choice compared with former Prime Minister John Howard. Former Prime Minister John Howard, who advocated an emissions trading scheme, had determined that he would have that scheme apply to petrol. He also made the very perceptive points that you cannot reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless you have a price on carbon. He went on to say that if you wanted to be a serious participant in this debate then you needed to acknowledge that pricing carbon came with costs. I do acknowledge that, and the biggest losers in this country will be asked to pay the price. The difference between me and the Leader of the Opposition is that he will be asking Australian families to pay the price. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his acknowledgement on the 7.30 program last night that his policies come with a price. When he was asked whether or not the money he would be using was taxpayers' money, he said, 'Look, I accept that.'                  So we know that the difference between the two plans is putting a tax on pollution and asking polluters to pay it, as opposed to putting a tax of $720 per year on Australian families. As we explain our carbon pricing package we will be explaining the assistance to Australian households, the mechanism to protect jobs and the impact of the tax on big polluters. The Leader of the Opposition will need to explain his $720-a-year tax on Australian families.

  What I have confirmed is that carbon pricing will not apply to petrol that is used by households and by light commercial vehicles, obviously the sort of vehicles that many tradespeople use. Further details about carbon pricing will be available in coming days and to the nation on Sunday. I will be very happy to take any question from Australian families and Australian businÂ­esses on the impact of carbon pricing. But in this debate, whilst the government necessarily can and should be supplying the details, and we will, I believe the Leader of the Opposition should be applying the same standard to himself. For example, he was asked today on radio about his plan to plant trees as the solution to climate change. He could not tell us how many trees. I can probably assist him with the number he would need to plant.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, the details will be available on Sunday and maybe on that day the Leader of the Opposition can explain where he is planting a forest five times the size of Tasmania.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. We on this side of the House understand the importance of tackling climÂ­ate change. We understand the importance of doing that for our planet but also if we want a prosperous economy for our children and grandchildren. We also understand the importance of doing this in the most efficient way, and a price on carbon is absolutely critical to provide the incentive to drive the investment in more energy-efficient practices and most particularly in renewable energy. A price on carbon is the key to a clean energy future, and to be a first-rate economy in the 21st century you have to be able to invest in clean energy. That is the point of putting a price on carbon.                  We understand that this will have a modest impact on prices, and that is why we will provide assistance to households and also assistance to support jobs. That is why we will support nine in 10 households, who will receive a combination of tax cuts, increases in family payments and pension increases. For those on the lowest incomes we will provide a battlers' buffer to make sure that those people are looked after. This will come on top of the tax cuts that have already been provided: three rounds of tax cuts over the past few years, where a person on $50,000 now pays $1,750 less tax and a person on $80,000 now pays $1,400 less tax. We will build on that to provide further assistance to households. There is one very clear difference here: we will put a price on carbon for the up to 1,000 largest polluters and use that revenue to support households and businesses. What those opposite will do is tax households and hand the money to the largest polluters. That will cost the average household something like $720 per year. That will be like sending cheques for $720 from Australian households to all of the largest polluters in our country. So there is a very clear choice between both of these policies. But the Leader of the Opposition cannot account for any of this. As former Treasurer Peter Costello said, 'He was never one to be held back by the financial consequences of his decisions.'                     I am, Mr Speaker. I am putting forward our approach to climate change and I am comparing that with the views of others, which is precisely what I was asked about.                     These are very big reforms and they do deserve a serious and considered debate. In our nation 25 years ago there were those who were opposed to the floating of the dollar, to the tearing down of the tariff wall and to the introduction of superannuation. Now, 25 years on, there is no serious policy maker -                      There can be no reform more important to our nation, to our economy and to our environment than reducing carbon pollution in our environÂ­ment. No reform can be more important than that. So, this is a worthwhile reform. It is a reform that is worth fighting for and it does deserve the most serious consideration in this House. That is what we are doing. We are putting forward our principles and we are comparing them with the lack of policy from those opposite.

  Mr Speaker -                      The government made it very clear last night that on Sunday we will be announcing all of the details of our plans to reduce carbon pollution. We have already said that all fuel - including petrol, diesel and LPG - for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles will not be subject to a carbon price. We also said in this House yesterday that we will be providing further detail, and that further detail will be coming on Sunday. They can ask all of the questions they like, but the further detail will be there on Sunday.                 We have always acknowledged that by putting a price on the carbon pollution of up to 1,000 of our largest polluters there will be a modest impact on prices. That is why we have said we are providing additional assistance to households and to industry, particularly industry that is energy intensive and trade exposed. All of the detail will be out there for people to see on Sunday. I have said before that this is a very big and very serious reform and it should be treated in the same way as other very big and serious reforms in the past.

  Thank you, Mr Speaker. As it happens, I do have an update that I can provide for the member for Lyne. As it also happens, if I had a question from the member for Gilmore or the member for Cowper, I would also have an update for them. However, they have not asked a question about GP superclinics, probably because they have committed to cut the funding for them. Nevertheless, I think the people of Port Macquarie will be delighted to know that just on Thursday last week the government completed negotiations with a preferred tenderer and was able to sign, and I can announce in the House today that a funding agreement has been signed with the Rural and Metropolitan Health Pty Ltd business, Port Macquarie, to build and operate the $7 million Port Macquarie GP superclinic. This is a group that is well known to at least one member opposite, the member for Paterson, who has an operational superclinic in his electorate at Port Stephens which is run by the same successful applicant who will build and construct the superclinic at Port Macquarie. I can also inform the House that the member for Richmond has made an announcement in her electorate about a successful application process which has come to fruition.                 The clinic in Port Macquarie is going to be an enormous investment for the local community. It is going to have integrated, multidisciplinary, team based care. It is going to have GPs, practice nurses, nurse practitioners, visiting medical specialists and allied health professionals. It is going to provide dietetic and psychology services, paediatric care, antenatal care and women's and men's health checks. Of interest, given the age of the community, there is going to be a focus not just on those paediatric services for the young families but also on the needs of older people in the community, including a commitment to provide home and nursing home visits. The selection of the Rural and Metropolitan Health group follows a very rigorous assessment process which is used for each superclinic and, as I have mentioned, it is a group that has a proven track record as an operator and already as an operator of GP superclinics.                 Of course, this follows hot on the heels of my having been in Gunnedah to turn a sod with the member for New England for the Gunnedah superclinic. I know this is a matter that the member for Parkes, Mr Coulton, was very active in promoting when it was in his electorate. It comes hot on the heels of the member for Franklin opening on the weekend the Clarence superclinic in her electorate. This is good news for commÂ­unities across the country. There will be 64 superclinics that will be provided to communities across all electorates. UnfortÂ­unately, the Liberal Party still opposes these, although I do notice that members like the member for Gilmore and the member for Cowper are anxiously awaiting the annÂ­ouncements from their electorates, and we will be certainly be making them very shortly.

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. As the Prime Minister has announced, the government will be announcÂ­ing on Sunday its carbon price arrangements, and these will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy and at the same time they will provide strong support for households and jobs. The carbon price, of course, is not a tax directly on households, but it is a price that will be paid by less than 1,000 of the largest polluters in the country. Some of these companies, of course, will pass on costs to consumers, which means that there will be a modest price impact for households.                     That price impact will be much less than that which was experienced at the introduction of the GST. The government will provide fair and generous assistance for those who need it the most, including pensioners and low- and middle-income households. These will be the government's priority in delivering houseÂ­hold assistance. The government has already committed, and we will deliver these commitments, that more than 50 per cent of the carbon price revenue will be used to assist households, that millions of households will be better off under the carbon price arrangements, that the assistance - contrary to the scare campaign being run by the Leader of the Opposition - will be permanent.                  It will mean that, under the carbon price arrangements, nine out of 10 households will get a combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Pensioners will benefit from a rise in the pension and around 280,000 self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that we will provide to cover pensioners, part-pensioners and carers. Three million Australians will also get a 20 per cent buffer over and above the full average cost of the carbon price to give them some extra room to move and families, tradespeople and small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a fuel price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. All of these commitments completely contradict and condemn the scare campaign run by the Leader of the Opposition.                  This is a package that will be good for the environment and good for the economy and, importantly for a Labor government, this will be a good package for Australian households and families. In contrast, the greatest threat to Australian households and families is from the Leader of the Opposition. He has been angry throughout this entire campaign period: does not like the scientists, does not like the economists and now he has got his sights set on households.                     The Leader of the Opposition has made absolutely clear -                      that with all these improvements he will claw them back at the same time as he will impose a $720 -

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I did answer a remarkably similar question yesterday, but let me direct my answer to the question that has been asked today in comparable form. To the member I would say, yes, I have taken a decision about petrol and I think it is the right decision for Australian families. On further right decisions for Australian families, I think it is the right decision for Australian families for this nation to tackle climate change. I think it is the right decision for Australian families to do that in the most efficient way possible. I do not believe it is in the interests of Australian families that we go around abusing Australian economists. I think we should listen to their views. I believe, having taken the best possible advice, that the best way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. As other members - the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for climate change - have answered questions today, we have had the opposition fronÂ­tbench yelling out: 'How will this cut carbon pollution? How does this work?' It seems to me these are all very odd questions from people who sat around the cabinet table of the Howard government and voted for an emissions trading scheme. Presumably, when they sat around that cabinet table they said to the Prime Minister - Prime Minister Howard - 'How will this work?'                     Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister is far from being relevant to the question and I would ask you to draw her back to the question.                     The carbon pricing regime that I am committed to is largely like the carbon pricing regime that Prime Minister Howard was committed to - the carbon pricing regime that had the support of the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow NBN minister, being the shadow minister for the National Broadband Network, the current leader of the National Party, and the list goes on - so exactly like the scheme that they supported when they sat around the cabinet table. The way in which this will work is it will put a price on carbon that polluters will pay. They understood that when they sat around the Howard cabinet table. And because you put a price on carbon and polluters pay it, polluters innovate - they understood that when they sat around the Howard cabinet table; they also understood that price impacts would flow through -                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order as to relevance.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about electricity price impacts and I was just explaining that, exactly in the same way that the whole scheme worked when the Howard cabinet sat around the cabinet table, prices do flow through. There are some price impacts for consumers, including users of electricity; that is right. It was true when the Leader of the Opposition sat around the Howard cabinet table and agreed with it; it is right now. In respect of those price impacts, of course we will provide assistance to nine out of 10 Australian households. The objective of the exercise is that it makes dirty energy more expensive and cleaner energy cheaper; that is, it helps our transition to a cleaner energy economy. They were the economics when John Howard was Prime Minister and the opposition frontbench agreed with emissions trading. They are the economics today.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question because he knows that each and every one of us has a responsibility to act on climate change. He and everyone on this side of the House, and one or two over there as well, knows that it is in the interests of our country, in the interests of our economy but, of course most importantly, in the interests of our children. We believe, on this side of the House, that it is big polluters who should pay. Big polluters should pay for their pollution; not families and not pensioners.                 Under our plan to price carbon every one of the 3.4 million Australian pensioners will receive assistance that will cover the average cost of a price on carbon. They will receive real and permanent increases to their pensions. The same will go for those self-funded retirees who are on a Commonwealth seniors health card. They, too, will receive the level of assistance that people on a pension will get. Those self-funded retirees who are on a Commonwealth seniors health card will get the same level of assistance as someone on a pension.                 Because we believe that it is the big polluters who should pay for their pollution, we do not believe it should be Australian families and we will be providing assistance to those families. Nine out of 10 families will receive help through our household assistance arrangements and that will particularly mean that low- and middle-income families will get help to cover the cost of expected average price rises. Of course, as the Prime Minister has indicated, we will provide a 20 per cent buffer, so three million low-income families will get assistance over and above any expected average increases in prices. One of the good things for pensioners and for families will, of course, be that they will get these payments directly into their bank accounts. They will not have to make complicated arrangements and there will be no queues to worry about. This assistance will go straight to them.                 We know that we do need to take these serious actions to help families play the role that they want to play to tackle climate change. By contrast, of course, those opposite are not the faintest bit serious about dealing with climate change. What we see from this Leader of the Opposition is all stunts. Every single day another stunt; no substance whatsoever.                     It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition wants Australian families to actually pay $720 to polluters. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do and, even worse, he wants to claw back -                      the benefits that this government will provide to families and pensioners.

  As I have already said, I think, on two occasions, today and yesterday, we will be providing further detail and that further detail will be provided on Sunday. We have made that abundantly clear. We have seen this scare campaign running for months now, but on Sunday most of this scare campaign will go up in smoke because all of these wild exaggerations and all of the claims and counterclaims will be exposed for the falsehoods that they are. So further detail will be there on Sunday.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. Of course it is very well recognised that putting a market price on carbon pollution is the cheapest and most effective way to reduce pollution. It is a view that is supported by many institutions - the IMF, the OECD, the Productivity Commission, the Treasury and economists all around the country. The government recognises that, which is why we are committed to the introduction of a carbon price, in the mechanism that we will announce on Sunday, as the cheapest, most efficient way of cutting pollution in our economy. This contrasts strikingly with the opposition leader's 'subsidies for polluters' scheme, where not only do businesses get paid from the taxpayers' purse but the Leader of the Opposition is the one who picks and chooses who gets a subsidy. In comparing the government's carbon price proposal with the Leader of the Opposition's 'subsidies for polluters' program, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Australia Bank, Mr Cameron Clyne, had this to say:                 If you're asking for an economic assessment of the two (policies), the carbon price followed by an emissions trading scheme is economically superior to the direct action policy.                 It will drive certainty; it will drive investment and so, in a straight comparison between the two, that's the choice.                 That is, the CEO of the National Australia Bank is making it clear that the government's policy position is the only way to go. It is no wonder that the opposition cannot find a single economist to support their proposition and, as previously stated by the member for Wentworth, of course it is a policy proposal that is a fig leaf that can be easily scrapped. But that does not worry the Leader of the Opposition in his approach to this issue. When he was asked today on ABC radio in Adelaide about his 'subsidies for polluters' plan and, in particular, the plan to plant trees to prevent climate change, this was what the exchange involved. The host asked the following:                 Where are you going to plant all these trees and how are you going to water them?                 The Leader of the Opposition replied:                 Well, I'm not saying that tree-planting is the whole answer but it is part of the answer ...                 The host then said:                 Well how many trees do you plan to plant?                 The Leader of the Opposition said:                 Well, that depends upon what proposals we get, and how cost-effective the proposals are, but there are all sorts of ways of doing this.                 There is a great degree of specificity in this proposal, isn't there! The fact of the matter -                      Not a bit sensitive, are you, mate?                     The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have a clue about his own policy. Of course, when the department of climate change had a look at this tree planting proposition, as the Prime Minister was noting before, the 'subsidies for polluters' policy would require trees to be planted in an area five times the size of Tasmania, 23 times the size of the Sydney Basin and roughly the same area that is covered by Germany. That is what the 'subsidies for polluters' policy means. I wonder whether the National Party has worked out that this means planting trees all over prime agricultural land in this country. The fact of the matter is that the opposition's policy is a joke. The only way to deal with this issue is by a market mechanism to do it at cheapest cost.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. He is right: Australia is an economy in transition. We are experiencing transformative forces which will happen regardless of who is in power. These forces are well known. We are living longer. Asia is re-emerging as the prime economic region of the world. We are heading towards a lower pollution envirÂ­onment and a more sustainable world. We recognise that the role of digital information will continue and expand and, of course, we are growing our services economy.                 What these forces mean is that we need to have good public policy, not just relentless negativity, if we are to be able to handle and manage an economy in transition. This means that Australia should not be afraid of the future. Led by our Prime Minister and our Treasurer, our plans have included enabling the creation of 258,000 new jobs in the last 12 months alone. We will price carbon to create a low pollution economy and a clean technology industry. We will share the prosperity of the mining boom by cutting company tax and lifting compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent to ensure that millions of Australians have more adequate retirement income. We are managing an economy in transition for our expanded resourcing for skills and training. We are certainly intending to bring the budget to surplus by 2012-13. We have a massive pipeline of $430 billion of future investment in the mining industry and we certainly intend to further engage with the growing middle class in Asia.                 But I was asked what the threats are to these plans, what the threats are to an economy in transition, and I believe that there is a very clear and present danger to the plans for a successful future for Australia. This is the threat of low expectations, the tyranny of low expectations, the fear of the future, the obsession by those opposite to freeze the Australian economy in the past. The threat is most clearly articulated by the relentless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. On any question, he will always say no. He does not want to increase superannuation, he does not want to decrease company tax, he does not want to have a price on carbon, he does not want GP superclinics, he does not like the National Broadband Network and he does not want to improve schools and libraries. Indeed, he does not even want Malcolm Turnbull to talk.                  The Leader of the Opposition is so negative that the member for Hume in the Liberal Party meeting this morning had to say, 'Why is it, Leader of the Opposition, that you have a staff member gagging us from being able to speak?' We know what happened. The member for Hume is a freedom fighter. He will stand up. Then the member for Hume was told in the Liberal Party room this morning, 'Mate, we are just making suggestions on being good team players.' Unfortunately, at the same time as the Liberal Party room was meeting in this relentless negativity - the truth hurts, doesn't it?                     I was asked about threats to the future of an economy in transition. One of the threats to the future, as I said, is a relentless negativity and this relentless negativity extends to gagging Malcolm Turnbull all the time. As the member for Hume was asking his question, at the meeting of Liberal press secretaries - I know you are smiling, Joe - the Leader of the Opposition's press secretary says, 'Mate, if the Sunday shows ask your boss to come on television, check with us and, if we don't want you to go on television, don't tell them that we said no.' The opposition is making such an art form of negativity. They have no policies. On Q&amp;A Joe Hockey, the member for -                      And we all know that, whilst they have almost no policies, they have got one. It is to bring back Work Choices industrial relations.

  I thank the member for his question, now that the Liberal Party cheering for Work Choices has died down. On the question that the member has asked me, I understand that he would be concerned and community members would be concerned about the full details of carbon pricing. Those full details will be available on Sunday. But what I can definitely say to the member is: we understand and every day that we have worked on carbon pricing we have understood that we need to take steps to protect Australian jobs. We have brought to that task our track record of valuing work, our track record of creating more than 700,000 jobs in this country since the government was first elected, and we are looking forward to the creation of half a million more, which is why in putting this package together we have at every stage had uppermost in our minds the need to work with Australian businesses and industries to protect Australian jobs. That is why the door has been open through the business roundtable and we have had consultation through that roundtable. Of course, all of the details will be available on Sunday and I anticipate at that point Australian businesses will publish their views and that is appropriate. The member can consider the full package then. I can say to the member: we value employment. Our track record as a government shows that we value employment and we have put this package together valuing employment and the protection of Australian jobs.

  I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh who has - as all of the South Australian members do, certainly on this side of the House - a very keen interest in the outcomes of Murray-Darling Basin reform. The Windsor inquiry gave us an opportunity for consensus and an opportunity for people to be very much working together on some of the ways that we can minimise the impact on communities. In particular, I quote from that inquiry:                 _ there is a general consensus that Menindee Lakes cannot be overlooked and require significant attention for the benefit of the Basin and its communities.                 For those members not familiar with Menindee Lakes, this has been the greatest opportunity for environmental works to potentially provide anything up to 200 gigalitres through more efficient use of the environmental water there. Therefore, many members, myself included, were concerned when the New South Wales government last week announced that they were withdrawing from the memorandum of understanding on Menindee Lakes and that the project would not go ahead.                 I had thought, following the Windsor inquiry, that there would be a joint approach across this House on being concerned about the New South Wales withdrawal from Menindee Lakes. For that reason I was pleased when Simon Birmingham, who some members will know is a senator, made the comment that this was a 'blow to the basin reform process and will make achieving the basin plan even harder'. No doubt it does put more pressure on issues like buyback when things like Menindee do not go ahead. We are waiting for New South Wales to come back with what they want to put in its place. But that did not put forward a universal position from the coalition. Indeed the coalition have continued to do post the Windsor inquiry what they were doing beforehand - that is, sending one message out to the South Australian media and the further up the basin you go, the messages, whether they come from Senator Joyce or from others, become quite different. The member for Farrer - I do not know what it is about Twitter, but that seven-second delay you get in radio does not happen between the brain and the thumb when they are dealing with Twitter - in complete violation of what Senator Birmingham was saying, said this: 'New South Wales pulls out the Menindee water deal _ excellent news.' When you get a state government pulling out of a potential 200 gigalitre saving for Murray-Darling reform, you do not view that as excellent news. It is not good enough to be sending one message to irrigation communities and the opposite message in South Australia.                 The Windsor inquiry was meant to provide an opportunity where we ended up with a unanimous report. We ended up with the Liberal members, the National members, the Labor members and the Independents having the same point of view. If only across the coalition we could get a consistent message on Murray-Darling reform. They can continue for the moment with different media units getting away with some local papers in irrigation communities running one line while downstream they are putting forward a different message. The Leader of the Opposition has some experience in providing opposite commitments on issues, but eventually you have to show your ballot paper. Eventually it will catch up with the Leader of the Opposition when the Murray-Darling Basin plan comes in front of this parliament. He will either have to vote yes to reform or back the positions that those upstream have been calling on him to take.

  The government is taking action on the question of carbon pollution and motor vehicles. We are doing that in what we think is a most appropriate way. First and foremost, in the recent budget - and, presumÂ­ably, the member who asked the question looked at the recent budget - we made a change to the fringe benefits tax arranÂ­gements. The arrangements we inherited had an artificial incentive for people to drive their cars further to get a tax advantage. All of us would have heard the stories from the community, and our friends and others would have heard the stories, of people who have spent every weekend in June driving their cars extraordinary distances for no purpose other than to trigger a move into a different fringe benefits tax arrangement. It was a dreadful scheme for the environment and something we addressed in the recent budget. During the election campaign we committed to mandatory fuel emission standards for 2015 -                      We are working to deliver those standards. We have also worked with the domestic car industry so that we are able to support jobs and to see greener vehicles manufactured in Australia. Many people faced a choice they did not want to make between buying Australian and supporting Australian jobs and -                    The member for Canning then left the chamber.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about my statement about cutting emissions from cars, and I have been talking about the government's policies to do just that. I have just explained to the member for Higgins, who directed the question to me, that we have acted on fringe benefits tax anomalies that got people to drive their cars further, generating carbon pollution for no reason. We are acting in accordance with our election commitment on mandatory standards in 2015. We have acted by working with the Australian car industry so that we can support Australian jobs and so that people can have the choice of supporting the Australian industry whilst purchasing for themselves a greener vehicle. Many people did not like the fact that the only way to access a greener vehicle was to buy something that was built overseas. They wanted to support the jobs of Australian car workers. We continue with that commitment to supporting Australian jobs through our more than $5 billion investment in our new-car plan. It is that investment that the Leader of the Opposition wants to slash, slashing support for the Australian car industry.                 To the member for Higgins I make the following suggestion. There are, of course, various ways of conducting an emissions trading scheme and various coverage arrangements. The member for Higgins worked for the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, who was very determined for the design of an emissions trading scheme to include petrol. Indeed, he said, 'If you want to encourage people to use less petrol in their cars, one of the consequences of that is that petrol will become less affordable. This is all part of responding to carbon emissions.' So who is the real member for Higgins - the economic rationalist who worked for Peter Costello or the member who follows the relentless negativity and economic vandalism of the Leader of the Opposition? I would be very interested in the answer.

  I certainly will be out speaking to Australians next week about the facts about carbon pricing, and I trust the Leader of the Opposition is out apologising to people for the false claims he has made.                     He can start by apologising to everybody that he told about a 6.5c a litre increase in the price of petrol - wholly untrue and something that the Leader of the Opposition has been around the country trying to raise fear about. As I am around the country talking to Australian workers and Australian families about the facts on carbon pricing, I hope the Leader of the Opposition is out telling them the facts about his 'subsidy for polluters' plan and, most particularly, the entry on page 14 that records his plan to penalise businesses, to put penalties on them. I hope he is out and about telling Australian workers whether it is their business that he is going to put a penalty on. I hope he is out and about telling Australian families about the cost impacts which will flow through to them because of those penalties and I hope he tells those families that he is not proposing to give them any assistance at all, that what he wants to do is take $720 off them and give it to big polluters. I hope he is out and about with those facts.                  I will be out and about talking to people about the truth about carbon pricing; about the science and the need to act; about the imposition of a price on the biggest polluters in this country, on big businesses; about the way that will enable them to innovate and cut carbon pollution; about the jobs that our clean energy future will promise this country; about the tax cuts and increases in pensions and payments for Australian families; about the measures to protect Australian jobs and the measures to tackle climate change. I will certainly be very proud to be out and about talking about those facts.

  I thank the member for Braddon for that question. We on this side of the House have understood for a long time the dangers of ignoring climate change in terms of our environment and our economy. We have understood the need to tackle climate change in the most cost-efficient way possible. We also understand that, if you put a price on carbon pollution, you have to assist households and you have to support jobs. We are putting a price on carbon pollution, to be paid by up to 1,000 of our largest polluters.                 We simply cannot afford to put this challenge in the too hard-basket for any longer. Certainty demands action. That is why we are seeing such strong support from the business community for a price on carbon pollution. Overnight, 55 companies have come out in support of putting a price on carbon pollution - companies such as GE, Grocon, AGL, IKEA and so on. This is what the CEO of Grocon had to say:                 Personally, I'm in favour of a cost on carbon. As I look forward in Australia, I see us at the threshold of some fantastic times and I get disillusioned when I see some critical decisions that need to be made for our future getting bogged down in politics.                 He is absolutely correct. Of course that is why organisations such as the BCA and the AiG are supporting a price on carbon, and that is why some of our biggest energy companies are also supporting a price on carbon - companies such as Santos, Rio Tinto, BHP, Origin Energy, Gloucester Coal and so on. That is why on this side of the House we understand that we must make this transition to a clean energy future. As we make that transition we do have to provide support to households. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts, increased payments and pension increases. Of course we will provide additional assistance to those on the lowest incomes.                 All of this stands in stark contrast to the approach of others who have a policy of subsidies for polluters and, of course, a policy which will not provide any assistance to households. The Leader of the Opposition was on The7.30 Report a couple of nights ago and he finally admitted that his policy will result in a direct slug on households - a direct slug of $720 per household. Of course that money will go directly to the biggest polluters in the country. You cannot put a slug of $720 on households and then pretend that you care about cost-of-living pressures in our community.                     You cannot say that you care about cost-of-living pressures when you are going to rip back tax cuts. You certainly cannot say that you care about cost-of-living pressures when you are going to slug households $720. Of course we all know that the Leader of the Opposition has no respect for economists and those on his backbench have no respect for his economics as well because we have a new underground econÂ­omic policy group, which has been formed by the member for Higgins, because they are so aghast at the lack of any alternative economic policy from the opposition benches. It is going to take a lot more than dusting off Work Choices and promising unfunded tax cuts to give this Leader of the Opposition some economic credibility.

  I thank the member for his questÂ­ion. I think it is very important that there is a shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change. Where that shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change leads us is that we live in a world where, as a result of human activity and the way we live today - the industrÂ­ialised high-energy way we live today - we generate more carbon pollution than at any other time in human history. What that means is that there is a level of damage already done which we cannot unthink or undo. There is a level of damage that lies in front of us and we can make a difference to that - that is, we can act to cut carbon pollution. Rather than saying, as a nation, that we are prepared to just allow whatever the future gives us in terms of levels of carbon pollution with all of the danger that that would create for our nation, we can act to reduce those levels of carbon pollution. I believe in doing that. I believe as a nation which is amongst the 20 biggest polluters in our world, we should be acting to cut carbon pollution.                 I am a little bit surprised about this question because I would have to say that, unless there has been a big change in opposition policy, I thought members of the opposition said that they supported cutting carbon pollution too. Maybe I am wrong about that. I know, of course, that climate change scepticism has swept through the Liberal Party and claimed the Leader of the Opposition, so now maybe they reject the need to do anything about carbon pollution and simply deny its existence.                     There may have been a change in the opposition because I note that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in this place referred to so-called carbon pollution, so maybe climate change scepticÂ­ism is now ruling entirely. They reject the science out of hand and they reject the existence of carbon pollution out of hand. But we, on this side of the parliament, accept the science. We believe we should act to reduce carbon pollution. We accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by pricing carbon. Then, of course, because we want as a Labor government to look after those in our community who need the most assistance, we will ensure that the money polluters pay funds tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households.                 The member in his point of order said that he was concerned about cost of living. He needs to make a comparison between tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households versus the plan of the Leader of the Opposition to charge households an extra $720 per year in tax, something that would impact on people's cost of living.                   The member for Flinders then left the chamber                   .                     On the question of cost of living, the member who asked the question may want to refer to the policy of his own political party, particularly page 14 - that is the plan to put penalties on businesses, businesses in his electorate. I do not know how many businesses in his electorate would get which size penalty. He may have to ask the Leader of the Opposition about that and how many of them it would drive out of business. I cannot help him with that; it is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, the penalty put on businesses would flow through presumably to the prices that they charge and into cost of living pressures. He may ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about that as well because the Leader of the Opposition wants to make a charge of $720 per family. He has this plan for penalties, rising cost-of-living pressures and he is planning no assistance. In fact he is planning to take back the tax cuts and pension increases that this government will provide.

  I thank the member for Hunter for his question because he, like this side of the House, understands that the Australian coal industry has an excellent future. That is very important for Australia because that is about jobs, exports and revenue. That importantly is related to our capacity to invest in a nation in fundamental government services such as education, health and child care.                 Let us deal with a few facts because this goes to the heart of the matter. I firstly refer to the latest ABARES data estimates. They show a 24 per cent increase in export earnings from energy commodities in 2010-11 to $71 billion in 2011. They then suggest a further 25 per cent increase in 2011-12 to $89 billion; interestingly driven by thermal coal, up 31 per cent to $18.3 billion; and metallurgical coal up 31 per cent to $31.9 billion. I understand economic figures bore the Leader of the Opposition, because they actually tell the real story.                  In terms of future expansion of the industry, it even looks brighter - a forecast increase in exploration expenditure on coal of 12 per cent. We are, and we will continue to be, the world's largest exporter of coal and so we should be. Prices are high and there is significant investment in Australia. It is our responsibility to grab these economic opportunities whilst they are there for Australia to grab.                 Just think about this: metallurgical coal prices have seen recent historic highs at $330 a tonne, thermal coal prices reached a record $131 a tonne, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk down the future of the coal industry in Australia that is not only economically significant to the nation at large but very significant to the economic opportunities in a range of key regions in many states and territories of Australia. I compare those prices to 10 years ago: in terms of coking coal, $50 a tonne - a sixth of what they are today; and thermal coal worth around $7 billion - a third of their predicted value today. You can see why this industry is important to Australia. Predictions are that these prices will continue and, more importantly, the pipeline of investment shows a huge potential expansion not only in the coal industry historically, in Australia, in areas such as the Hunter and the Bowen Basin but in the creation of a whole new coal corridor in the Galilee Basin, with a huge growth in demand out of India and potentially two major Indian investments in the coal industry in the Galilee Basin in Australia.                 This is about real jobs in Australia. It is about our resource and energy sectors driving our future and they will continue to expand. Just think about the expansion of jobs. The expansion of this industry is creating new jobs. The mining industry took on an extra 35,200 workers in the year to May of this year. From our point of view, the government understands the importance of the coal industry. It also accepts that it has a very bright future. This is about jobs, exports and revenues, and it is about our capacity as a nation to look after the broader Australian community and to invest in services such as health, education and child care. We do not find economics boring - the Leader of the Opposition might - because this is fundamÂ­ental to our economy. Start talking about the coal industry's bright future from the Leader of the Opposition's point of view rather than talking down investment and jobs in AustÂ­ralia.

  I certainly do respect the work of truck drivers. They work very hard for this country. That is why I was so determined to replace Work Choices with the Fair Work system so that they had a safety net and the benefit of decent working conditions. I did not want to see people who worked as truck drivers have their penalty rates taken away and have the money in their pockets stripped away through Australian workplace agreeÂ­ments.                   The member for Cook then left the chamber.                     I did not want them to be able to be unfairly sacked for no reason at all. So we have acted to work with truck drivers on their terms and conditions. Of course, many of them are owner-drivers not employees, and we have worked constructively with the Transport Workers Union on issues associated with owner-drivers and we will continue to do so.                 On the member's question about carbon pricing, can I suggest to the member that he study the details on Sunday when the full details of carbon pricing are released. He has asked me why I am pricing carbon. The answer to why is: I accept the science; I accept that our climate is changing; I accept that it is caused by human activity; I accept that means that we need to cut carbon pollution; and I accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by putting a price on carbon - that is, on the economics of the proposition I accept the same propositions that Prime Minister John Howard did, that the Leader of the Opposition did when he sat in Prime Minister Howard's cabinet and which he has accepted on many occasions since but no longer accepts now. I certainly believe that system -                      I was asked about trucks, carbon pricing and cost of living. I was just about to say that, on questions of cost of living, of course we want to work with Australian families. That is why nine out of 10 households will get the benefits of tax cuts or payment increases. What I do not want to see is the Leader of the Opposition's $720-a-year tax slug. What I do not want to see is the Leader of the Opposition's plan -                      I was responding to the member by saying it is my intention to work with Australian families to assist them with their cost-of-living pressures and it is my intention to defend them from alternative propositions to take money out of their pocket.

  I thank the member for New England for his question. He is one of a number of members on all sides of the House, people of all political persuasions, who have personally raised with me concerns about the live cattle trade. Many people representing electorates that are home to numbers of producers want to know, understandably and somewhat anxiously, when the trade will be resumed. We are working hard and progress is being made to achieve our goal of having the trade resumed in circumstances where we can track and trace where Australian cattle are going and the conditions under which they are slaughtered in the abattoirs that they go to in Indonesia. Progress is being made. We do need to continue to work hard on this. As progress is being made there are some more things to do, but I can certainly say to the member for New England that we are not letting a day go by, an hour go by, so that this trade is not suspended for longer than it needs to be. I understand the pressure that is putting on the shoulders of people in the live cattle industry. We are of course working with people in the live cattle industry to meet their needs and concerns at this time. There is a $5 million animal welfare package and a $30 million industry support fund. I know that some owners and growers have been distressed. There was, for example, a gentleman in Western Australia yesterday who made clear his distress publicly. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry ensured that he was contacted by the Cattle Council and by Centrelink so he could take full advantage of the support packages that are available to him. We will continue to work with the cattle industry, making those support packages available as we continue to work hard to resume this trade. I want to resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed.                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                     We will resume this trade in circumstances where we are confident the animal welfare issues have been addressed so the trade can have a strong and sustained future for the long term. I do not want to see a resumption of the trade in circumstances where questions remain about animal welfare, only to have the industry again confront a problem like this in six months time or 12 months time or two years time. We want to get this on the right footing for the long term. So we will continue to work hard and of course as soon as I am in a position to give any further advice publicly, I will certainly do so.

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question and his ongoing interest in jobs and manufacturing businesses in his electorate. Last week the government announced reforms, indeed 29 improvements, to strengthen the antidumping regime in this country. Those improvements will see greater resources and more expertise dedicated to investigating cases of dumping which may affect Australian businesses and Australian jobs. We will extend 'material injury' to ensure the remedy is commensurate with damage endured by local businesses, we will enable businesses to access measures more rapidly, we will speed up the process, we will allow greater transparency and we will prevent companies from circumventing duties by disaggregating or aggregating imported goods.                  These are very long overdue reforms that have been well received by both industry and unions. Companies such as Capral, BlueScope, OneSteel and Orica have embÂ­raced the government's announcements of last week. Indeed, the Australian Industry Group responded to the reforms by indicating:                 The new anti-dumping measures announced today by the Federal Government are a positive step to help rebalance the playing field for Australian Industry.                 The National Farmers Federation responded by saying:                 _ we are pleased to hear that the Government will improve the resourcing of Customs to work on anti-dumping issues.                 The honourable member asked about why these changes are needed and about what other approaches there are. These long overdue reforms are needed because those opposite neglected this area of reform while they were in government. For more than a decade these reforms were required, but the previous government did nothing. They did not listen to industry and they did not listen to workers in this country in order to provide that support. Instead, the Leader of the Opposition decided to set up a task force in opposition - he should have been supporting industry and workers in government - led by the member for Indi, of all people, to go around the country to promise everything but deliver nothing. We, in contrast, have been looking at the Productivity Commission report recommendations and we have been considering the private member's bill introduced into the Senate by Senator Xenophon - and these reforms are compreÂ­hensive. They are comprehensive and they redress the deficiencies that existed under the Howard government when it came to dealing with dumping that caused injury to AustrÂ­alian businesses. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he either just says no or does nothing when it comes to public policy.                     He says no or does nothing. They are his two approaches to every public policy matter. That is apparent on this issue and on other matters.                     I was asked what the government are doing. The government are responding to this issue. We responded to and dealt with the global financial crisis and supported workers and businesses. We dealt with that issue. We were the party that rid this country of the most extreme IR laws since Federation. We will continue to do the right thing as we have done in this area.                     We will continue to do the right thing by workers and business in this country.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I am very proud to say that today I introduced into the parliament the world's first legislation for the plain packaging of tobacco products. This legislation means that all tobacco products sold in Australia will, in the future, have no industry logos, no brand imagery, no colours and no promotional text. They will just be in a drab, dark brown pack with health warnings that will cover 75 per cent of the front of the pack and 90 per cent of the back of the pack. Those who manufacture, sell or distribute tobacco products could face fines of over a million dollars if they breach this legislation. I am pleased to say that at last the Leader of the Opposition - although he has been dragged kicking and screaÂ­ming - has indicated that the Liberal Party will support this measure, which I hope will be followed through on. However, I did notice last night in the House that the member for Mitchell put on the record his opposition to these measures. He outed himself as one of the supporters of tobacco in the Liberal Party room. He said that plain packaging was 'an example of ill thought-out proposals put forward by government committees' and that this was 'a ridiculous form of nanny state legislative response to ordinary, everyday problems'.                      Mr Speaker, the opposition understands there is a general warning and therefore is operating in an environment of listening to the minister's response. But I ask you, Mr Speaker: what is going to stop this kind of slagging and bagging of members of the opposition, which only invites a response from the opposition?                      Mr Speaker, if there is any offence taken to a currency that that remark has had attached to it, I withdraw it. But I still make the serious point about the minister's attack on members of the opposition, notwithstanding the general warning.                     I think perhaps amongst the hubbub people did not understand that I am actually quoting from a speech that the member for Mitchell gave last night in opposition to the plain packaging legislation that has been introduced in the parliament today - the very question that I have been asked. What the member for Mitchell said was that he did not think this sort of legislation was a decent response to 'ordinary, everyday problems'. The reason I quote this is that I take issue with the inference that it is ordinary, everyday Australians who are the ones who are not being harmed; in fact, 15,000 Australians each and every year who still die from tobacco related illnesses. If that number was distributed, the member for Mitchell, like every member in this House, would see on average 100 people die every year in his electorate because of tobacco related illnesses. I think that is an everyday problem that ordinary Australians do face and it is why we are taking action on plain packaging.                      The interjections we hear from those opposite just show that they are still reluctant converts. And we know why they are reluctant converts, because they are receiving thousands and thousands of dollars in donations all the time and they are embarrassed about it. The member for Goldstein, the member for Indi, the member for Sturt are all receiving thousands of dollars in donations still, and that is why they are so reluctant to support this legislation.                      Yes.                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the circumstances of the House that you have insisted upon since the beginning of question time, which is entirely within your power to do so as the Speaker, how is it in order for the minister to deliver that diatribe and then simply say she has concluded her answer and face absolutely no admonition?

  I thank the member for her question. We have made it very clear that all of the detail for pricing carbon will be provided on Sunday. We have made it very clear that we will be putting a price on carbon pollution on up to 100 - sorry, up to 1,000 -                      of our largest polluters -                    The member for Curtin then left the chamber.                     We have already made it very clear that the consequence of putting a price on carbon pollution for up to 1,000 of our largest polluters will have modest price increases. We have made that very clear. And of course they will flow through the system, which is why the government is so intent on putting in place additional assisÂ­tance for households, and we have outlined the principles that that will be based on. There will also be -                      I was making it very clear that there will be additional assistance for households: there will be tax cuts, there will be increases in family payments and there will be increases in pensions. All of those things are very important. I know they do not matter to those opposite, because if they were in power they would simply rip them out.                     I am responding to the question, Mr Speaker. All of the detail will be there on Sunday for everybody to see, and can I just make this point: we absolutely look forward to this debate in the weeks ahead so that all of the scaremongering that has come from those opposite can be exposed for what it is.

  Of course - on Sunday - the government will be announcing the details of a carbon price package that will cut pollution and -                      As I was saying, the government will be announcing the details of the carbon price. It will cut pollution, it will drive investment in clean energy and it will provide strong support for households and jobs.                 This morning the government's plan to put a price on carbon pollution received more support from the business community. Companies like AGL, Fujitsu, Ikea and General Electric, and 51 others, are now part of an organisation called Businesses for a Clean Economy, and in a statement released today these and a host of other businesses stated:                 As major Australian and international corporations and representative associations operating across the Australian economy we strongly support the introduction of a well designed carbon price to support the transition to a low-carbon economy.                 Those companies, which are major corporations operating within our economy, know, along with every credible economist, that putting a price on carbon pollution is the cheapest and most cost-effective way of cutting pollution. Of course, it is not a tax on households; it is a charge that will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest polluters in the economy for every tonne of pollution that they produce.                 The carbon price will be good for the economy and it will be good for the environment, whilst households will be assisted to meet the modest cost impacts of the introduction of a carbon price. Nine out of 10 households will get some combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Pensioners will benefit from an increase in the pension. Many self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that we will provide to other pensioners, part pensioners and carers. At least three million households will also get a 20 per cent buffer over and above the average price impacts of the carbon price to give them that bit of extra cash. Families, tradespeople and of course small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a fuel price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. These are very important commitments to accompany the introduction of the carbon price in our economy.                 Households should also be very clear that the Leader of the Opposition intends taking all of these rises in the pension, intends clawing back the tax cuts, intends taking back all of the assistance -                      Mr Speaker, I simply point out that the minister was not asked to debate the question. He was not asked to attack the opposition. I would ask you to draw him back to the question or sit him down.                     Of course, I was asked how the government's announcement of a carbon price has been received and what the government's response to that is. It is relevant, I would submit, that the opposition has a position that it would take away the benefits that the government intends providÂ­ing as part of this package to pensioners, self-funded retirees and families.                     The choice for the Australian people in relation to this issue is very clear. The government wants to provide tax cuts, pension increases and increased payments for households. The Leader of the Opposition wants to tax households an extra $720 a year to pay money -

  I thank the member for his question. He has raised the instance of price gouging and deceptive behaviour. These matters are dealt with by our competition and consumer watchdog, the ACCC, which has full powers to deal with them. I am more than happy to take up his case. He should provide the full details to me to pass onto the ACCC so it can do its job.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The fact is that climate change is real and we know this because our scientific community, particularly climate scientists, have a consensus about it. An open letter from the scientific community in June of this year said:                 The overwhelming scientific evidence tells us that human greenhouse gas emissions are resulting in climate changes that cannot be explained by natural causes.                 There is a context in which we should understand what our scientists are telling us. The fact is that science underpins the quality of life that we have in Australia. In 2011-12 the Commonwealth will invest an estimated $9.4 billion in science, research and innovation through programs across the Australian government - some 43 per cent higher than the high-water mark, so called, of the Howard government. There are 55,000 researchers working in Australia's univerÂ­sities and tens of thousands of researchers working in CSIRO, the public service and cultural institutions in the not-for-profit sector.                 Scientific knowledge starts at school and of course as education minister I do know that many of our best and brightest started learning about science when they were at school. Australia's record in science is a proud one. I think of the Tidbinbilla deep space tracking station, quite close to us here in Parliament House, and great Australian scientists like Howard Florey, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1945 for his discovery of penicillin. There are many, many others. Scientists lead the research that drives a modern economy; scientists lead the fight against disease; scientists are immunising our children, fighting cancer and looking into space - and the same body of people is telling us, using the same scientific methods, that climate change is real and we must take action. Sir Gustav Nossal, made Australian of the Year in 2000 for his pioneering work in immunology, is highly respected amongst the global scientific community and he told the Sydney Morning Herald last month:                 I believe global warming is real. Action has to start now, if not the day before yesterday, for the simple reason that the effects are so long-lasting and so dire that they will linger well into the future.                 Regrettably members opposite do not share the views of the scientific community. Senator Bernardi says:                 Quite simply, the concept that there is a consensus on the science is one of many fabrications undertaken by the alarmists that has now been debunked.                 The Leader of The Nationals in the Senate has said:                 I never believed the science is settled. If the science was settled, Copernicus would be dead.                 The Leader of the Opposition himself has said that the argument on climate change is absolute crap.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact is that these are statements on the record by our leading climate scientists compared and contrasted with statements on the record by opposition politicians.                     I am not surprised this causes those opposite some discomfort, but the fact is that what this government is doing about climate change is taking action: supporting renewable energy, supporting some of the biggest solar power stations in the world with the announcement made recently about the solar power stations at Chinchilla and Moree, and most importantly putting a price on carbon - the most environmentally effective and economically efficient way to deal with the dangers of climate change - with a policy that is informed by scientists that have made our country great and with a recognition that we need to get on with the job.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question because he knows it has been this government that has put disability on the national agenda. It was this government that delivered record increases in the disability support pension and the carer payment. These have been very important increases in these pensions that help carers and people with disabilities.                 Just today I have introduced legislation into the parliament to help make sure that the impairment tables that help to determine access to the disability support pension are regularly updated. The last time they were updated was in 1993, so it is certainly high time that they were updated to reflect advances in medicine and rehabilitation practice. Just last Friday the Better Start for Children with Disability program started. I want to say to every member of the House just how important this program will be to the around 9,000 children we expect to benefit. For children who have cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and children born with sight or hearing difficulties, their parents will now be able to get access to financial support so that they can afford early intervention services for those children. This builds on the very successful program we have delivered over the last few years for children with autism, and we understand around 12,000 families and their children have benefited from early intervention services as a result of that initiative.                 Mr Speaker, I hope you do not mind me mentioning that there have been 67 local councils sharing in grants of around $100,000 to help people with disability to get access to local facilities, and one of those facilities is in the local arts and convention centre in the City of Whittlesea. Another initiative that is taking place, and which was one of our election commitments, is the building of 150 supported accommodation places for people with disability through a new innovation fund.                 As part of our efforts to deliver a clean energy future, we will be providing assistance to people on the disability support pension and those on the carer payment. We are very pleased to be able to provide additional support through an extra payment to those who are eligible for Australian government concession cards and who have high essential electricity costs due to a medical condition or disability. Those people will be provided with additional support as we deliver a clean energy future.                 Very importantly, we understand that there is more to be done and that is why the government gave a very important reference to the Productivity Commission that asks them to inquire into the feasibility of a long-term care and support initiative for people with disability. It has never been done before in this country. It is a very important initiative and we look forward to receiving the Productivity Commission's final report at the end of this month.

  Firstly, I believe that the coal industry has a bright future in this country - that is, I completely disagree with the outlook and analysis of Senator Bob Brown and others on this question. I believe the coal industry has a bright future in this country. The members named by the member for Paterson represent their electorates well in this parliament and they frequently raise issues with me in relation to their electÂ­orates - issues about jobs, health, education and meeting the assistance that families need with cost-of-living pressures. But on the coal industry they, like me, understand that this is an industry with a very bright future. It is an important part of our economy and it is an industry that has experienced very solid growth.                 I will remind this parliament how strong our coal industry is right now. The spot price of coking coal is over $300 per tonne and it is around $120 per tonne for thermal coal - that is, it has doubled since 2008-09. The industry's gross value added was $22.5 billion. The near-term outlook is strong. Our experts are advising that for coal alone there is an investment pipeline of over $70 billion. Nineteen mine projects are committed or under construction and are expected to add around 60 million tonnes of additional mine capacity per year by the end of 2014, and a further 64 mine projects in the coal pipeline are awaiting approvals. So it is a strong industry with a bright future and with great employment prospects associated with it. The member has asked about the impact of carbon pricing on this industry. The best way I can respond to that is to use the words of James MacKenzie of Gloucester Coal, who talked about the expected impact of a price on carbon. The words of James MacKenzie, who works in the coal industry, are:                 We are talking about $1 a tonne in the coal industry. It is not something that is going to affect the economics of the coal industry ...                 He also said:                 I was in London last week on a road show for Gloucester Coal, so I would have seen 20 institutional investors. There was not one grizzle about the carbon tax. Not one mention of it.                 Not one grizzle about the carbon tax; simply not mentioned! I understand that the member who asked this question will be out there trying to spread fear in coal communities but I say to coal communities that they should feel absolutely reassured that this industry has a bright future, that employment will continue to grow. Even those in the coal industry who have been critical of the government's plan, such as Ralph Hillman of the Australian Coal Association, have confirmed that the coal industry will continue to grow and employment prospects will continue to grow in this industry.                 There is a bright future for coal with a carbon price. There are a limited number of particularly gassy mines which the government will assist as we work with the coal industry but it would be wrong, irresponsible and not in the national interest for people to try to distort the facts and claim that the coal industry does not have a bright future. It does.

   I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. This year's budget delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to make mental health reform a priority for this term of government. The budget delivers the largest mental health package ever with $2.2 billion worth of new measures delivered over five years. The government is moving quickly to roll out some of these measures.                 Last week, I was pleased to announce that mobile phone calls to Lifeline made from anywhere in Australia will now be free of charge, thanks to an agreement between the Australian government and the three major mobile carriers - delivering a key election commitment made by the government last year. Around one-third of the 450,000 calls that Lifeline receives every year are made from mobiles. The average call to Lifeline lasts around 20 minutes and obviously some of the calls from more distressed people last significantly longer. This is a significant cost to Australians in crisis who often are also suffering financially.                 Many people calling Lifeline would be on prepaid mobile plans. The last thing any of us want is to be cut off in the middle of what might be a life-saving telephone conversÂ­ation with a Lifeline counsellor. I want to place on record the government's gratitude to the three carriers and their representatives for their cooperation on this measure - not only for the technical changes which needed to be made but also for them bearing a share of forgone revenue along with the significant compensation payments the government will be making to them. This measure undoubÂ­tedly will save lives.                 Last week I announced that up to $4 million will be invested to establish a new national mental health consumer organisÂ­ation. The new organisation will be hosted initially by the Consumers Health Forum, CHF, and will ensure that the voice of mental health consumers is heard loudly and clearly as the government delivers on mental health reform.                 Funding has become available for divisions of general practice and ultimately Medicare Locals to provide crisis counseÂ­lling on an emergency basis for people who are referred by their GP or from emergency departments and are at risk of suicide. Divisions are also receiving a substantial increase in their base-level funding for psychological services targeted particularly to people on low incomes and to people in rural and remote Australia. Headspace services across the country now qualify for huge increases in their core funding, allowing them to expand services like outreach to schools and to homeless youths. Having recently announced providers for 10 new services, expressions of interest will be sought over the next several months for the next tranche of 15 new headspaces.                 A number of initiatives from the Prime Minister's taking action to tackle suicide package also became available last Friday including funding for preventative infrastruÂ­cture at suicide hotspots, funding for an outreach service to schools affected by suicide, recognising tragically that still two or three high school students die by suicide every week, raising the risk of copycat attempts at those school communities, and also, funding for community led suicide prevention initiatives with a particular focus on Indigenous communities, which we know are at higher risk.                 This reform package is comprehensive, balanced and targeted across the lifespan. It will make a meaningful difference to the many tens of thousands of Australians living with mental illness and their families.

  I would say to the Leader of the House: there is no truth in the rumour I am writing the Leader of the Opposition's questions.                 To the Leader of the Opposition let me say this: I made a deliberate choice in designing the scheme that will be announced on Sunday. We are finalising the carbon pricing scheme and it will be announced on Sunday. In designing that scheme I took a deliberate decision that we would design it in a way which was true to our Labor values of assisting households who needed our assistance the most. That is why we are in a position to say that we will be working with Australian households and providing nine out of 10 households with tax cuts, with payment increases or a combination of both.                 I also believe it is appropriate not to have householder petrol covered in the scheme. As I have explained to this parliament during the course of this week, I understand what it is like for people to live in communities where, whilst we would wish public transport were better - and we will be working over time to make public transport better - the reality is that members of the community who need to get around really have no choice but to jump in their car. Of course, that is true across country Australia as well, in many of the electorates that Labor members represent as well as the electorates represented by the member for New England and the member for Lyne. So we made a determination that petrol should not be covered in the scheme. I think that is the right thing to do for Australian households.                 Yes, that is a design change from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, but I say to the Leader of the Opposition: pricing carbon in the way we are intending to price it is the most efficient, cost-effective way of cutting carbon pollution. So every choice we have made is about making the greatest change at the least cost.                     I can confirm that petrol will not have a price impact from pricing carbon and consequently petrol will be cheaper than it would otherwise have been if we had put a direct carbon price on petrol. Australian households, despite the fear campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, will not see extra cents per litre when they go and buy petrol as a result of us pricing carbon, so it is good for Australian families and good for Australian households, and I am really quite surprised the Leader of the Opposition would be recommending anything else.                 As for costs of abatement throughout the scheme, economists tell us, and of course they are right, that pricing carbon gets you the lowest cost abatement, and that is what the government is determined to do. The Leader of the Opposition, in contrast, is wedded to his grossly inefficient and costly scheme which would give us far higher costs of abatement per tonne, putting an extra burden on Australian families. And we can put a dollar figure on that burden: it is $720 per year.

  I thank the member for McEwen for this question on a very serious issue. Of course, the government moved to deal with the cruelty we saw on the Four Corners program a number of weeks ago. Australians were rightly shocked to see Australian cattle treated with that kind of cruelty and Australians rightly wanted action. As I have said before in this parliament, I had the opportunity just before the suspension came into effect to meet with representatives of the live cattle industry. I have since met with them on a number of occasions and every time they have said to me that they do not want to see their animals treated like that. We needed to move to a suspension to address these animal welfare issues.                  I am pleased that yesterday we were able to move to resume the trade because several important factors came together which made that possible. Those factors were that we agreed with industry how the international standards would be operationalised and the framework that would give them effect. We also had confidence, having reached that agreement and from information provided to us by some elements of industry, that a number of exporters in Australia were ready or close to ready to meet these standards. Also, we had received advice from Indonesia that they were prepared to issue permits for the importation of live cattle. That meant we were in a position to say that Australian industry could seek export permits under the new standards, that export permits would be granted on the basis that people could track and trace animals, that there would be transparency at every point of the supply chain and that there would be independent auditing including in the abattoirs in Indonesia. We were able to reach that situation through a new regulatory framework agreed with industry. Then we were able to see that a number of producers could meet that regulatory framework and we got advice from Indonesia that they were in a position to issue import permits.                 I understand that the days of the suspended trade have been pressurised and anxious for people in the live cattle industry, which is why I am pleased we were able to work to this conclusion and announce it yesterday. I thank in particular the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig, for his work. During these pressuÂ­rised days, we have continued to work with industry on support measures including the $5 million animal welfare fund and the $30 million assistance package, as well as income subsidy arrangements for those who work in the industry. As the trade resumes, we will continue to work with industry to support cattle growers and to support others who work in this industry. I am glad we have reached a stage where we are able to see a resumption of this trade with appropriate animal welfare standards met and I am glad we are able to reassure Australians that appropriate steps have been taken, so that we do not see the kind of animal cruelty we saw on the Four Corners program.

  I thank the member for his question. First, I thank him for his frank acknowledgement that electricity prices have been going up and that that is nothing to do with carbon pricing. Often in this place we hear a great distortion about what is happening with electricity prices, with members of the opposition coming into this place and trying to pretend that the electricity price rises Australian families have sustained have somehow been caused by carbon pricing. Yes, electricity has risen. It has risen for a number of reasons. It has risen particÂ­ularly because there is a need for more investment in electricity, including in electricity distribution. That investment is costly and it has been flowing through to electricity prices. And Australians have not got direct assistance to help them with the cost of that rising electricity. Now to the member I would say: people, I do believe, look at electricity prices. If they can receive good information about how to reduce their energy consumption whilst still doing the things that they need to do in their daily lives and still enjoying all the creature comforts that we are used to and want to keep, I believe people will respond to that informÂ­ation. There are a number of relatively simple things people can do to reduce their electricity consumption and to reduce their carbon pollution, and I believe that many Australians are motivated to do that and that with the better provision of information many more Australians will do that. On the question of carbon pricing and electricity, what I can say to the member is, yes, we have always said that when we were putting a price on carbon pollution to be paid by the biggest 500 polluters in this country -                      I was asked about consumer behaviour and electricity pricing and I am directly dealing with things that can influence consumer behaviour and electricity pricing. I have just talked about questions of information provision to consumers which I believe can make a difference and now I am going on, having been asked about carbon pricing and electricity, to directly explain the impact of carbon pricing on electricity. I was explaining, before I was interrupted by the point of order, that we have always been very clear that the way carbon pricing was going to work was the big polluters would pay the price, so around 500 polluters paying the price, and that there would be flow-through impacts on prices paid by families, including electricity, and that, to assist those families, we would provide tax cuts and increases in family payments and pensions.                 So I can say to the member, who is professing concern about the impact of electricity prices, that nine out of 10 Australian households will get compenÂ­sation, will get assistance through tax cuts or increases in payments. Now that is a pretty stark contrast to Australian families having seen electricity prices go up with no assistance directed to help them with those prices and it is a pretty stark contrast too to the opposition's plan to take away all of the assistance we intend to provide and to put on top a new tax of $720 per year.

  I am asked how we will deliver a price on carbon; let me answer that question. We will deliver a price on carbon in the most efficient way. We will deliver a price on carbon, respecting the science that is leading the way and telling us that our climate is changing, that that change is caused by carbon pollution and human activity and that we need to act to cut carbon pollution.                 The plan I will announce on Sunday will be a plan to cut 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution by 2020. That is a very large change in the way that the nation generates carbon pollution. It is the equivalent to taking millions and millions of cars off the road, and that is the aim of pricing carbon: to cut carbon pollution. The plan that we will announce on Sunday will be a plan that protects Australian jobs and gives us access to the clean energy jobs of the future.                 I am pleased to report to the House that, this month, we have seen in our nation 60,000 new jobs created. That is fantastic; we want people to have the benefits and dignity of work. As we go about pricing carbon, we will protect Australian jobs and get access to the clean energy jobs of the future. Around 1.6 million extra jobs will be created by 2020. We will price carbon in an efficient way, which is through an emissions trading scheme. We will reach that through a limited period of a fixed price and then reach an emissions trading scheme. This is the system of pricing carbon that was supported by former Prime Minister Howard. It is the system for pricing carbon that was supported by the member for Wentworth. It is the system for pricing carbon that economists recommend as the most efficient way of pricing carbon.                 Because we are a Labor government we will ensure, as we price carbon, that we assist Australian families, and particularly that we assist those families most in need. Fifty per cent of all of the revenue raised will go to Australian households; nine out of 10 households will see tax cuts and increases in payments. We are talking about pensioners, family payments and tax cuts for working Australians. Three million Australian houseÂ­holds will see a 20 per cent buffer. That means that the net amount of new money provided to them will be 20 per cent more than the expected impact of the carbon price on the goods they buy. They can come out better off as a result of our pricing carbon. Indeed, across the nine out of 10 households that we will assist, we will be providing information to people about how to cut their energy use. If people take some simple steps to cut their energy use, they too can pocket the tax cuts, or pension increases or family payment increases provided to them.                 This is the right plan for the nation's future. It is a plan to create a clean energy future, tackle carbon pollution, get big polluters to pay, protect Australian jobs and assist Australian households. It is the right way to price carbon, driven by our Labor values, and all of the details will be available on Sunday.

  I thank the member for his question. Let me explain to the member that coverage decisions have been made which do reduce the number of big businesses who will be paying the price for their carbon pollution. The biggest 500 polluters will be, under the scheme, required to pay a price for the carbon pollution they generate. Our plan is to make polluters pay. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to make Australian families pay. So, in making those decisions about coverage, the number of big polluters who will be paying has been reduced. I would have to say that I detect a theme across the opposition's questions today. I detect an emerging theme. There are some days when you come in here and you have absolutely no idea what they are on about, but today I can tell what they are on about. They are on about their sense of disappointÂ­ment because they have spent months and months and months trying to raise fear about carbon pricing. Now I think we can see written on their faces, as more and more details become clear about the scheme, that they can feel it. They can feel that their scare campaign is not going to be able to be sustained.                     In answering the member's question and explaining the coverÂ­age changes that have been made in the scheme as compared with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, what I increasingly sense is a sense of disappointÂ­ment from the opposition. They wanted to have their petrol price scare campaign. The Leader of the Opposition was already out claiming 6.5c a litre, and he was dead wrong. They wanted to have a campaign about how wide the scheme was covering and now they can see that scare campaign shrivelling before their eyes, because as usual they have been dead wrong. They wanted to have a cost of living scare campaign. They wanted to be out there scaring Australian families about the impacts of carbon pricing, and now of course it is clear nine out of 10 households will get tax cuts or payment increases, which should actually lead the opposition to say to itself: how irresponsible they have been over the last year trying to scare Australians, making things up, as we get on with pricing carbon in the most responsible way.                 We will cut carbon pollution. We will get the big polluters to pay. We will protect Australian jobs. We will provide tax cuts and payment increases. We will get this job done in a Labor way, driven by our Labor values. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition is hostage to sceptics. He is determined to rip assistance off Australian families. He wants to put an extra $720-a-year tax on them. He wants to go around scaring Australians about the prospects of their jobs. Well, we are a confident, creative nation. We have been up to the big challenges in the past. We will be up to this big challenge, and the Leader of the Opposition will be increasingly exposed as someone who went about generating fear with hollow and untruthful claims and as someone who is not ready to lead this nation - no ideas for the future, just relentless negativity and the saying of no, no, and no.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. In answer to the member's question, I would inform him of the followÂ­ing. Australian standards do not mandate the use of stunning. It is widely used but it is not compulsory in Australia, and international standards do specify ways of humanely slaughtering animals where stunning is not used. However, we have been clear that we think stunning is to be encouraged and preferred, and that is the approach we will take as we work on the resumption of the live animal trade. In terms of the mandated standards, we have gone for international standards. Those international standards do not mandate stunning; neither do Australian standards mandate stunning. So I understand that this is a debate in which people will have a variety of perspectives.                 There are, of course, some who come to the animal welfare debate with more stringÂ­ent views than others about the slaughter of animals. There are some people who believe the killing of animals for food is wholly wrong. Now, of course, people are going to bring their various perspectives to this debate. But, in working out the conditions under which we would resume the trade, the relevant conditions that we have adopted are the international conditions. With the new export permits and control mechanisms, exporters will have a permit which enables them to export live animals, provided there is tracking, tracing, auditing and the standards are the international standards.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her very important question because, as I outlined to the House yesterday, the global economy does face some substantial challenges and, thankfully, our economy is one of the strongest in the developed world. You can see this in the pipeline of investment in resources - the $430 billion that has been outlined by ABARES. Of course, we have a debt position which is the envy of the developed world. We have low unemployment. When the global financial crisis hit, our unemployÂ­ment rate was the same level as the United States. Now theirs is twice ours, with unemployment here at 4.9 per cent. Today we have seen the Labor force figures, which show unemployment again at 4.9 per cent. Something like 23,000 jobs have been created in the past month of June, with strong growth in full employment - something which is celebrated and supported by everybody on this side of the House. Of course, this adds to the 750,000 jobs that have been created and the 222,000 jobs created in the past year. One of the reasons why employment is so strong in this country is that this government got the big economic decisions right. We acted at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession to support our economy. But that is not the only reason why our economy is strong compared to other developed economies. We have also over a 25-year period put in place the really big economic reforms, and that adds to our economic strength compared to the economic strength, or lack thereof, of so many other developed economies.                 You would have to ask the question: where would Australia be now if we had not put in place a great reform like compulsory superannuation, which was opposed by those on that side of the House? Where would we be if the government of the day then had caved in to the fear campaign that was being run against that great reform?                      Where would Australia be today if past governments did not have the guts to bring down the tariff wall and to float the dollar? Where would Australia be today? What these instances demonstrate is the importance of fundamental reform for the future because, if we face up to the challÂ­enges of reform, we will be doing the right thing by future generations. Those that are opposing fundamental reforms are in fact supporting lower living standards for future generations.                     Shame on them. We in this country have a strong economy because governments over 25 years have been prepared to take the tough decisions, to look to the long term, to look to those policies which will drive prosperity, but unfortunately those on that side of the House do not have that courage. In 25 years time there will be people looking back and saying, 'Why were they debating and contesting the science of climate change in the parliament 25 years back? Why were there sceptics then who did not believe in the importance of pricing carbon, did not believe in the science of climate change?' We on this side of the House understand the science and we understand the economics of climate change and we understand its importance for our future prosperity. The fear campaigns we are seeing now we have seen in the past, and those that run those fear campaigns will be reflected on very poorly in the pages of history.

  For once I have been quoted accurately by the shadow Treasurer because I said 'up to'.                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government makes no apology whatsoever for not putting a carbon price on fuel used by passenger vehicles or light commercial vehicles. But, listening to the questions from those opposite, you somehow get the impression that they now favour a carbon price on fuel used by passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles. That is the only logical consequence you can gain from what is being said by those opposite. Those opposite are just completely embarrassed. The government's policy is very clear.                     I thank the shadow Treasurer again for his question. We have been very clear that the largest polluters will be paying a price for their carbon pollution and we will be using the revenue to assist households and to support jobs. The reason those opposite are now so embarrassed is that their policy is actually to tax families and households $720 a year and give the money to the large polluters.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his very predictable question. Here we go again. The nation, of course, is facing turbulent economic times. It is the intention of the government to manage the economy now, to keep the economy strong and also to enact the reforms today that we need to have to ensure that the economy is strong for the future. In order to do that, we need to put a price on carbon to realise the clean energy future, the clean energy jobs and the innovation that this country should have.                 Working here with the parliament that the people have voted for, during this parliamentary session we will present legislation to put a price on carbon: a fixed price for the first three years, moving to an emissions trading scheme. The impact of putting that price on carbon will be that we cut carbon pollution; that we see an increase in the use of clean energy; that we see all of the jobs and innovation which will come with that increased use of clean energy; and that we will cut taxes, increase pensions and increase family payments. We will ensure that we take the positive action necessary to seize that clean energy future for our nation.

  I thank the member for her question. Australia has a bright future and the fundamentals of our economy are strong. In recent days, of course, Australians have watched a flood of concerning international news. Over the last few weeks, there has been plenty to watch on our TV screens and much of it has been very concerning. As people have watched it, they have been concerned about the political brinksmanship they have seen played out in Washington, they have been concerned by the institutional weakness they have seen in a number of economies and they have been concerned by the fiscal issues they have seen playing out on the world stage.                 But, as Australians have watched this flood of news internationally, our standpoint has been a very different one from people around the world watching this news. Whilst this news is concerning, it also paints in sharp relief the achievements of this country. Australians are rightly proud of our economic achievements, and that is a pride I share. When people from overseas look at Australia, it is often with a sense of great envy - great envy about our beaches; great envy about our climate. Today, people are looking at our nation with a sense of great envy about our economy. There are many nations around the world who would very, very quickly change all of their macroeconomic indicators to be the same as this country's.                 We are better placed than any nation on earth to ride out the current global turbulence, and that is not because of any accident. It is because of the actions that this government took to keep our economy out of recession during the global financial crisis. It is because of the decades of reforms that have led to the resilience of our economy. It is because during the global financial crisis employers went that extra yard to keep people in jobs and unions cooperated with employers in order to keep people in work. It is because of that resilience that has been tested time and time again, a resilience that has always stood up to the challenges, that we can face the future with confidence.                 We can face the future with confidence because we have solid economic growth, low unemployment and low debt. Those things are not simply words - they are real things impacting on Australians today. Low unemployment means 11.5 million Australians take home a pay cheque every week. It means our unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent. In the UK it is 7.7 per cent and the US is at 9.1. We have strong public finances, so people around the nation can get on with the concerns in their own lives and not need to have concerns about the nation's finances. Public debt is less than seven per cent of GDP in this country compared with 80 per cent of GDP in the UK and 86 per cent of GDP in the US, and we have a huge pipeline of investment - $430 billion - in the resources sector of the economy alone. Australians are rightly proud of the economy that we have built together. It has strong fundamentals and strong foundation stones and, because of that, even during this period of global turbulence, we can face the future with confidence.

  Mr Speaker -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: of course this is question time and this is his opportunity to come in here and make criticisms of the government, and that is appropriate. What is not appropriate is to try and spin decisions that have been made by companies today about Australian jobs and pretend that they are somehow related to the government's plan to price carbon. To do so is completely disrespectful both to those companies and, more importantly, to the workers in those companies -                      many of whom have got bad news today. Qantas has announced that there will be job losses of around 1,000. Qantas has made it abundantly clear that that is about conditions and competition in international aviation, and to associate that with a government policy is to show the ultimate disrespect to those Qantas workers who would be feeling anxious having heard this decision from Qantas today. What a dreadful thing to do when those people are under pressure - and equally in relation to OneSteel, where the Leader of the Opposition has already made such disgraceful false claims and has gone to places like Whyalla and said to those people that their town would be wiped off the map, only to be repudiated by the management of OneSteel, who have made it crystal clear in the public domain that the government, in working out its carbon pricing scheme, had heard and responded to their -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In relation to OneSteel and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition's false claims made on 27 April this year - 'Whyalla will be wiped off the map' - and then the words of Geoff Plummer, the CEO of OneSteel -                      who said, and I quote, 'We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I referred to comments by the Leader of the Opposition on 27 April in a doorstop. I am now referring to comments made by the CEO of OneSteel, Mr Geoff Plummer, on 10 July 2011, when he said:                 We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the -                  Steel Transformation Plan -                  is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach.                 So to the Leader of the Opposition I say this: our carbon pricing package is about seizing economic opportunities for the future. Our carbon pricing package will enable great Australian businesses to continue doing what they are doing. Indeed, we will see businesses grow, we will see economic growth and we will see 1.6 million new jobs. What the Leader of the Opposition most certainly should not do in this parliament is try and associate announcements today about job losses - very unfortunate announcements about job losses - with the government's policies and plans. To do so is an attempt to mislead Australians already in difficult circumstances because their employers have said that they will need to reduce jobs. We will take a different approach. We will work with those businesses. We will work with those employees. We will support them and not get them involved in a political debate, because that is such an inappropriate thing to do.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question. As I indicated to the House earlier we are facing uncertainty and turbulence in global financial markets. I made the point earlier that there is a long and painful adjustment to take place both in Europe and in the United States and therefore we are not going to see for some time strong growth in either of those areas. All of that makes it much more important that we put in place very strict fiscal policy, predictable fiscal policy, in this country.                 We have many things going for us in this environment, as the Prime Minister was saying before. We have lower debt than major advanced economies. One of the reasons our debt is lower is we put in place a responsible fiscal stimulus and therefore we avoided the capital destruction and the very high levels of unemployment that are now being experienced in many other countries around the world. But when we moved to put that stimulus in place we also put in place our fiscal rules and were determined to come back to surplus as soon as was responsibly possible. We have been applying those rules from the time that we put that stimulus in place in February 2009.                 The consequence of that is we did get a very big tick for our economic management from the IMF when they were here recently. They gave the economy a very big tick and said it had been very well run in very difficult circumstances and that we had handled the global recession in one of the most responsible ways of just about any other developed economy in the world. We realised when we put those strict fiscal rules in place that we would have to restrain spending growth and that we would have to put in place responsible savings and that is what we are doing. We are putting in place that fiscal policy. I will quote from the IMF report of only a week or two ago:                 On fiscal policy, we commend the authorities for remaining committed to returning the Commonwealth budget to surplus by 2012/13 _ This consolidation is faster than in many other advanced economies and is more ambitious than earlier envisaged _                 This discipline, this commitment, stands in stark contrast to the position taken by those opposite. It was only one year ago when the Treasury and the department of finance found there was an $11 billion black hole in their election commitments.                     I was making the point that, given the global uncertainty, fiscal discipline is absolutely critical in the environment we are in and that the IMF has made the point that the government has been putting in place that fiscal discipline, that it has been showing expenditure restraint, that it has been putting in place responsible savings in its budget. I also made the point that the global conditions do make all that more difficult, but the government is determined to return to surplus. I make this point because it stands in sharp contrast to the bungling and irresponsibility of those opposite: an $11 billion black hole one year ago which has now blown out to $70 billion -                      Seventy billion dollars is a lot of money. I say this to the shadow Treasurer: with bungling like that you will not have the confidence of markets.                     Mr Speaker, I was pointing out that the fiscal stance of those opposite is a risk to the economy.                     A $70 billion savings ambition is the equivalent of all Medicare payments for four years.                     The government is committed to returning the budget to surplus despite global difficulties. We are committed to putting a price on carbon. We are committed to investing in skills and infrastructure and we are committed to a responsible fiscal policy, unlike those opposite who want to take $70 billion from the budget.

  In answer to the shadow Treasurer's question, yes, the budget in May had in the budget forecasts a surplus in 2012-13, exactly as we promised at the last election campaign. As the shadow Treasurer may have noticed - I hope he has noticed; it was certainly the subject of the Deputy Prime Minister's ministerial statement before question time - there has been turbulence in global markets.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As the Deputy Prime Minister detailed in his statement to the House before question time -                      Yes, the Leader of the Opposition is right, I was not here to listen to it. I was at a funeral.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In answer to the shadow Treasurer's question, the Deputy Prime Minister earlier today outlined the turbulence that there has been in global markets and the fact we are not immune from that even though, of course, our economy has got such strong fundamentals. What the Deputy Prime Minister made clear to the House is of course that it does have an impact, and when we update the forecasts in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook then we will update the impacts coming from that global turbulence that we have seen on markets and its potentials for impacting on global growth. The Treasurer has also made the obvious and common sense statement that impacts on global growth and potential impacts here make it more challenging for us to bring the budget back to surplus, but we are absolutely determined to do so and we expect to do so.                 We are in a very different position coming to this task as compared with the opposition. We are in a different position because we have shown fiscal discipline throughout and we have adhered to a clear set of fiscal rules. That of course meant that when we went to the last election campaign we had all of our policies properly costed and we found offsetting savings for the new expenditures that we promised to the Australian people. The opposition did not take a similar approach and found itself in an $11 billion black hole. Now of course, since the election campaign, that $11 billion black hole has worsened to $70 billion. The shadow Treasurer has staked his reputation on the statement that he can find savings, cutbacks, to equal this $70 billion. He said very boldly -                      On the question of budget surpluses, he said very boldly that 'finding $50 billion, $60 billion or $70 billion is about identifying waste, identifying areas where you do not need to proceed with programs'.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked a question about the budget surplus and I have made the position of the government clear. I am simply asking for comparable clarity from the shadow Treasurer. If he is to find $70 billion in savings, then I ask him to list them. Seventy billion dollars is the equivalent of not paying pensions for two years. Seventy billion dollars is a lot of money. We await the shadow Treasurer's $70 billion list of cutbacks. I think Australians will be very interested to see it.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. In answer to the member for Kennedy's question, as he would be aware, constitutional responsibility for the regulation of these onshore resources rests with state governments. On the issue he raises, the Commonwealth government has been closely monitoring both the debate about coal seam gas and concerns about impacts on water.                 The role of the Commonwealth government becomes enlivened when a project comes to the minister for the environment through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act - that is, it is a project of a major scale and it has got some environmental significance and consequence. When those things have happened the minister for the environment has taken the best of scientific advice and has placed large numbers of conditions on projects, including conditions which go to the underlying water and to monitoring the water condition. To give you an example of that, the government imposed more than 300 detailed conditions each on the Santos and British Gas coal seam gas projects and 270 conditions on the APLNG proposal that I believe the member referred to. So, yes, when these matters do come before the Commonwealth there is a clear understanding that we do need to take the best of scientific advice. We get that expert advice from agencies like Geoscience Australia. We always ask for detailed water management plans and monitoring regimes to avoid or minimise impacts on groundwater and on surface water.                 On broader debates about coal seam gas, I do understand the member is concerned. He is not on his own there; other members of the parliament have raised some concerns. In managing these sorts of questions, it is very important, I think, to recognise we have a constitutional position which gives a state government a particular role. We are talking about an industry worth billions of dollars to this country, with billions of dollars of investment in the pipeline. We are also talking about farmers, some of whom have profited from the identification of coal seam gas on their land and some of whom have had concerns about the question.                 In order to deal with this issue - billions of dollars of investment, a constitutional position and some farmers with concerns - what you need to do is to be studied, methodical and careful. You have got to make sure that you understand the situation, that you act consistently and that you give the same message to all parties. It is certainly not appropriate to get on a radio station one day and say something which would void constitutional law and then ask for a serve of humble pie at a press conference on another day. That will not be the approach that we take. We will continue, under Commonwealth law, to work these issues through methodically with the best of scientific advice.

  I thank the member for his question on pricing carbon. Since the parliament last sat, the government has announced a plan to put a price on carbon, to cut carbon pollution, to cut taxes, to increase pensions and to increase family payments. We will bring that plan, in the form of legislation, to this parliament during this parliamentary session and it will be through the parliament before the end of this year. That means that we will be able to put a price on carbon from 1 July next year.                 During the winter recess I have had the great privilege of moving around Australia and talking to many Australians about our plans to put a price on carbon. I have talked to Australians in all sorts of circumstances, in community meetings, in shopping centres, at morning teas, at factories and at mines right around the country, and what I have found is, yes, there is a high degree of concern but people do want to know the facts about putting a price on carbon. They also want to understand what it will do to deliver a clean-energy future. As I have moved around the country talking to Australians in this wide variety of circumstances, I have been in a position to talk to them about the natural advantages our nation has for a clean energy future. We are a country with abundant sources of renewable and clean energy. We are a country with abundant sources of solar power, wind power, geothermal power and tide power, and I have had the opportunity around the country not only to talk to Australians about this clean energy future but to see also some innovative new projects that are already generating energy out of clean and renewable sources. All up, consequently having had these discussions, I have seen with my own eyes the way that the new clean energy sources can create more jobs and higher skills, how they can create more investment in innovation, and how they can ensure that pollution goes down and not up. This is a reform that will attract investment to Australia and that is a great outcome for our country.                 Of course, undertaking this reform was never going to be easy. But government is not about doing what is easy; it is about doing what is right for the nation's future. It is right for our future to create a clean energy future. Because we are a Labor government, as we have gone about this reform we have ensured that the assistance that will flow to households will particularly flow to those Australians who need it the most. People will see tax cuts, pension increases and increases in family payments, and Australians who need that assistance most will see more of that assistance.                 What this does mean is that there is a major tax reform associated with this clean energy future. It will enable people to more directly see the benefits of the work they do and it will mean that a million Australians no longer need to fill in a tax return. This is good news for Australians making the journey from welfare to work. It is good news for Australians who are second-income earners and making a decision to return to the workforce.                 So we are facing up to the big challenges of the future. Tackling climate change is a challenge that needs to be taken seriously. You need to be there explaining the facts to people, not making wild assertions. You need to be there telling people consistently what this means - the same message to people every day rather than saying different things to different audiences. I have enjoyed doing that during the parliamentary recess and I look forward to continuing it as we move to pricing carbon on 1 July.

  To the member's question, I have already in this question time answered a very similar question from the shadow Treasurer so I would refer the shadow finance minister to that answer. I would also ask the shadow finance minister when he believes he will be in a position to detail to the parliament the $70 billion of cutbacks that are necessary for the opposition to climb out of the black hole that it has got itself into.

  I thank my colleague the member for Newcastle for her question. As the Prime Minister averted to earlier, on 10 July the government announced its plan for a clean energy future, which includes of course the introduction of a carbon price into our economy. This is a major economic and environmental reform. The plan will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy, and at the same time we will assist households and of course support jobs. More than half of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism will be used to assist households. The assistance for households will be delivered by tax cuts and increases in the pension, family tax benefits and other government payments. In fact nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance. The carbon price mechanism is a market mechanism which is important to ensure that cutting pollution is achieved at least cost to Australian households and businesses. When emissions trading starts in July 2015, businesses will be able to access credible international carbon markets to ensure that we achieve the emissions reductions at lowest cost.                  All of that stands in stark contrast to the policy of those opposite, which is a 'subsidies for polluters' scheme. The opposition would take money from households and pay polluters. There would be no assistance for households to meet those costs. In a recent policy development the Leader of the Opposition indicated that their policy would impose the highest cost possible on households and businesses. In a classic piece of policy on the run - say one thing to someone and another to someone else - the Leader of the Opposition has ruled out access for business to international carbon markets. This has very important implications. The carbon price will need to be much higher and the economic costs will be much higher. On the basis of access to international carbon markets the opposition's policy had previously been costed at $720 per household. With this latest development, no access to international carbon markets, the cost will now be $1,300 per household. A cost of $1,300 per household - take it from households, pay it to polluters; subsidies for polluters! There will not be any assistance for households under the coalition scheme. All of this for the sake of some populist drivel that we should not be trading with foreigners.                 We have seen the Leader of the Opposition take his scientific advice on this issue from One Nation. Now he is taking his economic advice from them. He was at a rally today and Pauline Hanson was there. She has been in the gallery behind him again. She has probably gone off to write up a few notes for him. This positioning - one thing to one person - and these ridiculous, populist, antimarket economic propositions will cost the Australian people significantly. There is no better demonstration of the Leader of the Opposition's preparedness to say anything and do anything - he says one thing to Alan Jones and another thing to miners and someone else. The Leader of the Opposition goes around spreading fear and alarm through deliberate misrepresentation. You cannot trust his word.                   The member for Fadden then left the chamber.

  Of course I have already answered the member's question once today when asked by the shadow Treasurer. Maybe the shadow minister for education would do best to direct his attention to how much money will come out of education to fill the $70 billion black hole that the opposition has got its way into. Will it be all of the money out of schools? Will it be all of the money out of universities?                     As I have indicated to the parliament already in question time today, we will adhere to our fiscal rules. As I have indicated to the parliament already today, we are determined to return the budget to surplus. As I have indicated to the parliament and the Treasurer has indicated to the parliament both in answer to questions and in the statement he made before question time today, the global economic turbulence we have seen is turbulence we are not immune from but our fundamental economic structures are strong. Consequently, it has made the journey to surplus more challenging, but we are determined to achieve a surplus.                 The thing that would press on those on the other side who are interested in the question of surplus most is the $70 billion black hole they have and how they are going to fund it. Of course, in a portfolio like education - and I do know the expenditures in that portfolio well -                      to even make a dint on a problem like $70 billion you would need to be taking out all of the money in schools and all of the money in universities. The person who asked the question may like to direct his attention to that.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. It is not surprising that she is one member who would want to ask this question, because in her electorate of Parramatta the historic Health Reform Agreement, which has been struck with every state and territory around the country, is delivering 45 extra beds at Westmead Hospital - and 40 of those are already open, providing services to patients as we speak today.                 This reform is going to deliver to many patients, not just through the provision of extra beds - 1,300 extra subacute beds - but also through greater efficiency, greater transparency and accountability, more services for patients and less waiting. An extra $19.8 billion in funding is going to be provided. We have committed to sharing in the growth of hospital expenditure in equal partnership with the states and territories. In doing that we have assured that there will be accountability for where every dollar of public hospital funding is going. For the first time we will be paying hospitals actually for the services that they deliver. There will be national standards for emergency departments and for elective surgery - and the MyHospitals website will publicly report on performance - and more local governance of health services through the establishment of local hospital networks and Medicare Locals.                 Reform like this is never easy in health. It is a credit to the Prime Minister, who has had the determination to get these big things done. I also want to congratulate all of the states and territories for finalising this agreement, including all the Liberal Premiers - those in Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria.                     Unfortunately, as the interjections indicate, that is where the bipartisanship ends. When it comes to the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow minister for health, they have always said no to health reform.                 They have as recently as yesterday said in the Financial Review that they will oppose legislation that will lock in this extra funding for hospitals. So it seems to me, when a question is being asked about where a $70 billion saving is coming from, that the health portfolio had better watch out. In fact the shadow minister for health has been put on the razor gang to look for savings and you would wonder why that would be. A $70 billion cut to hospital funding would close 40 per cent of hospitals right now - 20,000 beds would have to close. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has a history of cutting funding from hospitals and we do have to worry if he is really determined to find $70 billion worth of savings - where will that come from?                     Our government is about doing the hard work, delivering reform, getting proper accountability in the system and making sure that patients can be treated in a better way, more quickly, with better quality and that electorates like Parramatta and elsewhere across the country get extra beds into their hospitals where they are needed. That is happening right now, today, as we speak.

  When we announced our carbon pricing package we put before the Australian people all of the figures that go with it. We indicated at the time that we would make appropriate provisions at the time of MYEFO to make savings and of course we will do that. We made savings in the lead-up to the budget, we will continue to make savings and we will continue to adhere to our fiscal rules.                     What I would say to the shadow Treasurer - something that he may want to consider about carbon pricing - is that, in my understanding of the current position of the opposition, they say somehow that they can decline the revenue source but still engage in the expenditure. When you determine to do that, that is what ends up giving you a $70 billion black hole.                     In answer to the shadow Treasurer's question, clearly the government accounts for its budget through the budget in May and through the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and we will in the mid-year outlook provide a further accounting in relation to carbon pricing. The figures are there for people to see from the announcement we made shortly after parliament rose.                 What I would also say to the shadow Treasurer is that, and perhaps he will want to do it on the same time frame, he may want to provide full accounting to the Australian people about how he will account for his plans on pricing carbon and particularly how he will fill the $70 billion black hole.                 The shadow Treasurer raised the question of honesty. There are some things that the opposition does not talk about. For example, I doubt that when the Leader of the Opposition addressed the rally today that he talked about his $1,300 slug on families. I doubt when he addressed the rally today he talked about the fact that, under the government's plan, more than four million households will be better off and he intends to take that money away. I would be interested to know whether the Leader of the Opposition, when he addressed the rally today, indicated to the people at the rally that his target to cut carbon pollution is the same as the government's at minus five per cent or did he, as he has been known to in the past, find this a convenient occasion to dump his target and not back it in? The shadow Treasurer talks about honesty and talks about being held to account. I believe that the opposition has an obligation in all circumstances to be honest about its $1,300 slug on families and I believe it has an obligation to account for the $70 billion black hole.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his commitment to people with disabilities and their carers. It is very pleasing to be able to tell not only the member for Blair but the whole House about the progress that the government has already made. Last week the Prime Minister announced that our government has already started work on the extremely important task of transforming the disability support and care system in Australia. Something -                      I beg your pardon?                     I did not actually.                     It is very disappointing to hear, Mr Speaker, because the Productivity Commission's final report, which the Prime Minister released last week, into long-term care and support of people with a disability does show that the current system of disability is broken. That is why the government asked the Productivity Commission to do this major inquiry: it is because we do understand that, for people with disability and their carers, the current system is broken - and we intend to fix it. We intend to fix it and we intend to start right now.                 We understand just how important it is and that is why as a government so far we have taken a number of very important actions, doubling the amount of money that we are providing to the states and territories for disability care and support to make sure that the services that are being provided at the moment are improved. We have done that since we have been in government because of the terrible state of care and support for people with disabilities and their carers.                 We also understand how important it is not only to increase the funding for disability services but to really build a new system, an insurance system, because we need a new approach to disability care and support. We have started that work already. As the Prime Minister announced last week, she is taking a recommendation to the Council of Australian Governments this Friday.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was indicating, the Prime Minister this Friday is taking a recommendation to the Council of Australian Governments to establish a new select council on disability reform. I thank her very much for her leadership on this very, very important issue to millions of Australians who have been waiting decades for these changes.                 The government has also committed an additional $10 million to get on with the very important technical work that is needed to make sure that we get, as we have termed it, the NDIS - the National Disability Insurance Scheme - ready, to make sure that we have the common assessment tools and the quality assurance work and to make sure we have the workforce ready so that we can start to build a national disability insurance scheme.                 We understand how important this is. The Productivity Commission has recommended that by 2014 we be ready to launch the scheme. We want to make sure that, with the states and territories, we are ready by doing this technical work with the disability sector and the carers, who are doing an extraordinary job right now. I thank the Prime Minister for her -

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question -                      I thank the member for his question because one of the truest tests of a decent society is how it treats its seniors - those citizens who for many years worked hard, paid their taxes and raised their families and who, in their older age, require a bit of care and support in return from the community that they helped to build.                 This government has a proud record and an ambitious agenda around ageing. It is this government that delivered record increases to the age pension and that has a plan to extend that great Labor reform of universal superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. We are talking to seniors about ways to lift opportunities for mature age workforce participation, and the government's work bonus will allow older Australians to keep more of their wage and more of their pension when they take up those opportunities. Over the winter recess, as the House has heard, the last details of health reform were finalised by the Prime Minister and her COAG partners. This is a reform that delivers more doctors, more beds, shorter waiting times and an e-health record to older Australians.                 On top of all that the Prime Minister has committed the government to beginning reform of the aged care sector in this term of parliament. To that end the Prime Minister released last week the final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry, a comprehensive report with 58 far-reaching recommendations. No-one in the sector thinks that reform in this area will be quick or easy, but they all think that it is essential. I have already begun meeting with sector stakeholders, providers, consumer groups, aged care unions and clinicians to work through those recommendations methodically. This week I will attend the first of a series of forums across the nation to talk directly with older Australians about their views on aged care.                 I notice that I have been criticised by the opposition for talking directly with older Australians, but I make no apology whatsoever for taking time to have those important conversations. On this side of the House we know that talking directly to people who use the system will add different perspectives to those presented by stakeholders who have no difficulty coming to Canberra and having their views heard.                 The Prime Minister has been clear that this process should involve an open conversation and that the government will be guided broadly by four guiding principles. Firstly, that every older Australian has earned the right to be able to access care and support that is appropriate to their needs when they need it. Secondly, that older Australians deserve greater choice and control over their care arrangements than the system currently provides them. Thirdly, that funding arrangements for aged care need to be fair and they need to be sustainable, both for older Australians themselves and also for the broader community. Fourthly, that older Australians and the community rightly expect quality care, and this rests in significant part on our ability to continue to attract and to retain dedicated and qualified staff.                 I very much look forward to hearing the views of older Australians through this important process.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question I would remind him that he and I, the government and the opposition have exactly the same target for the reduction of carbon pollution in 2020. The figures that he refers to are figures which would apply to his target as well. What the Leader of the Opposition fails to recognise is the difference in the two schemes. Ours is a price that is paid by big polluters and as a result we cut carbon pollution. We then use that revenue to assist Australian families by cutting tax, increasing family payments and increasing pensions. We protect Australian jobs and we invest in a clean energy future. Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan to reach exactly the same target he puts a tax on families -                      Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan he would oppose additional tax on Australian families. He would give that money to big polluters, he would cut pensions and he would cut family payments. Here we go again. We are apparently back to that moment where the Leader of the Opposition went to a meeting and decried his own target as crazy, only within 24 or 48 hours to recant from that. We are back to that moment again so -                      I am directing my answer to the target of the government and the opposition for the reduction of carbon pollution in 2020. The difference here is that the government backs that target in every day of the week, the Leader of the Opposition tailors his answers on that target to whatever audience he is speaking to that day.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is not that long ago, a few decades but not that long ago, that we in this country used to talk about the tyranny of distance and our economic debate was dominated by the fact that we felt remote from the markets that we most wanted to trade with. In response to that we lived behind high tariff walls with all the implications that had for real wages. It reduced the real wages available to working people over time with all the implications that had for suppressing innovation in our economy. Our economy changed as we moved away from such a tyranny of distance model and we opened our economy up to the world. We commenced the economic reforms that were necessary to change a closed insular economy into a great trading economy. Australians can be rightly proud of the economy that we have built together, a great trading economy and an economy that has come out of the global financial crisis strong, not having gone into recession and not having seen the sharply rising unemployment we have seen in other countries around the world, where millions and millions of people have lost their jobs.                 What was that tyranny of distance is now an opportunity for us, a huge opportunity. We are in the region of the world that is continuing to grow strongly and we are prospering from that growth. Three-quarters of Australia's goods exports go to Asia - a quarter of them to China alone. These are important statistics. We continue to have a prosperous future trading with the economies of our region, which are continuing to grow.                 As we are in the right region of the world, we bring to this task the right economic fundamentals. We have low unemployment. We have strong prospects for growth, with $430 billion of projects in the pipeline in the resources sector alone. We have strong public finances. We have a strong banking system. This is important and is a standout in comparison to the positions of nations overseas that are coming to the economic challenges of today with high unemployment, high debt and institutional weakness.                 Consequently, we are here with a huge opportunity, a huge opportunity that we can seize by keeping our economy strong today and by engaging today in the reforms that our economy will need to keep it modern and strong tomorrow - that is, we have to bring the same national character and characteristics to today's reform challenges as past generations brought to the reform challenges that confronted them. That is why, to manage today's economy, we are determined to invest in skills, to invest in infrastructure, to better tax our mineral wealth and to spread those benefits through the cutting of company tax, through the growth of our pool of national savings and through special breaks for small business. Over the medium to longer term we are determined to keep investing in our productive capacity and to grow our productivity by investing in education, by investing in skills, by rolling out the NBN, by seizing the opportunities that come from a clean energy future and by bringing our reform tools to health and education.                 We stand in a country with strong economic fundamentals and a huge opportunity for the future. It is an economy we have built together, and we should be proud of it.

  I possibly should have studied that new shadow ministerial list that the Leader of the Opposition tabled earlier, but I do thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. In answer to her question I would repeat the answer that I gave to the House yesterday, which is that we have a clear plan to bring the budget to surplus, we have strong fiscal rules and we are determined to bring the budget to surplus.                 In coming to this task of bringing the budget to surplus in 2012-13, we will build on what we have achieved in the May budget. We have been determined to look for savings. We did that in the May budget, and of course we did that in the election campaign prior to the May budget. We do not bring to this task the $70 billion black hole which the opposition built up through their own fiscal incompetence. We are determined to bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13.                 The Treasurer gave an economic statement about this matter yesterday. We have been explaining to people the turbulence in global markets. We have also been explaining to people that our economy has strong fundamentals and that as a nation we should be proud of those strong fundamentals because we built them together. We particularly ensured those strong fundamentals were held during the global financial crisis, where we had the combination of the reforms that this nation has engaged in over a number of decades, the decisive action of the government in providing economic stimulus and attending to banking issues, and the hard work of employers and employees and trade unions in the community. Through that national spirit and combined national work, we came out of the global financial crisis without going into recession - something we should all be very proud of.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. Yesterday I reported to the House on the changing global economic conditions, and overnight we have seen further broad based weakness in the euro area. There has been some improvement in the US figures overnight but we are still going to face very substantial economic headwinds in the global economy as we go forward.                 In Australia we do have every reason to be confident about our fundamental economic strength. As the Prime Minister said, we avoided recession. Virtually alone amongst developed economies we avoided recession. We have low unemployment, we have low debt, we have low deficits and we are located, as the Prime Minister said, in the right part of the world at the right time.                 But we cannot take all of this for granted. What we have to do is put in place the fundamental long-term economic reforms that will ensure our continued economic strength. Where would Australia be today without the far-sighted reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments? I will tell you where we would be: we would have a really high tariff wall, we would have an old, rickety, fixed exchange rate, and of course we would not have the national savings that we have got through national superannuation. What we would have is an economy stuck back in the 1970s. This indicates the importance of putting in place these long-term reforms for the future, the importance of putting in place a price on carbon. You cannot be a First World, first-rate economy in the 21st century unless you are powered substantially by clean energy.                 We do need to boost productivity, and of course we have the NBN, a very substantial boost to productivity and a very important long-term reform. And of course we need reforms when it comes to the taxation system, bringing down taxes for small business so that they can grow. The patchwork nature of our economy makes these long-term reforms all the more important.                 Those opposite want to go around the country talking our economy down. Shame on them for talking this economy down the way they do, day in, day out. They go wandering around telling people anything they want to hear and suddenly turn round and find out there is a $70 billion black hole in their budget.                     On this side of the House we are getting the big economic calls right and building on our strengths. What that has meant is low unemployment. We have a proven capacity to deal with global economic uncertainty. We have faced up to the big challenges of the future. Those on that side of the House cannot get their story right. On Friday the member for North Sydney said there was a $70 billion black hole in their budget estimates, and on 7:30 last night he said, 'I didn't say it.' He has developed amnesia.                 They are all over the place when it comes to fiscal policy. They would rather see the country fail than the government succeed.

  I stand by the budget and I stand by the government's commitment on the surplus. Let us be very clear about that because there is a very clear contrast. We on this side of the House have a commitment to a set of strict fiscal rules, and they on that side of the House have a $70 billion black hole. The contrast on fiscal policy could not be clearer. We on this side of the House understand the importance of putting in place strict fiscal policy. When we moved to stimulate our economy in 2009 we outlined a very clear and consistent set of fiscal rules, and we have been applying those fiscal rules in a clear and consistent way. In fact, we went through the whole election campaign last year and did not spend an extra dollar, but what we found out after that campaign was that there was a $10 billion hole in the estimates of the opposition.                     So their record on fiscal policy is in tatters. Now there is a $70 billion hole. It has gone from $10 billion to $70 billion in -                      We are proud of our budget. Our budget has the backing of the rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund. If there is a choice between the shadow Treasurer and the International Monetary Fund, I know which one I would take. This is what the International Monetary Fund has said about our budget and our fiscal policy: 'We commend the authorities' -                      Of course I stand by the budget. I am proud of the budget.                     He is very embarrassed about that $70 billion black hole.                     Yes. I come back to fiscal policy, which is what the question was about. It was about the surplus. By any definition the surplus is fiscal policy. I know that is not understood on that side. The Leader of the Opposition, bored by economics, thinks economists are stupid.                     I am. This is what the IMF has had to say:                 _ we commend the authorities for remaining committed to returning the Commonwealth -                      I was quoting the IMF:                 We commend the authorities for remaining committed to returning the Commonwealth budget to surplus by 2012-13.                 The IMF went on:                 This consolidation is faster than in many other advanced economies and is more ambitious than earlier envisaged -                      I am proud of the budget. I stand by the fiscal commitments in the budget. I wrote the budget. Of course I stand by the budget. I do not know what you are on about. I honestly do not know what you are about. What I do think you are on about is the embarrassment of the $70 billion black hole in your lack of fiscal policy.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in national security matters. Of course, Australia's air combat capability is a vital part of our national security framework. I make this point crystal clear at the outset and I will also make it at the conclusion of my remarks: I will not allow, and the government will not allow, a gap in our air combat capability.                 Let me refer to some of the facts here. The member referred to the F111, of which we had 24. It served us very well. We now have about 70 - 71, in fact - classic Hornets. They are subject to an upgrade and maintenance program, and we expect that they will be retired by the end, or at the end, of this decade. We also have 24 Super Hornets - 20 have arrived and four are to be delivered by the end of the year.                 The white paper and the Defence Capability Plan talk in terms of around or up to 100 Joint Strike Fighters at an estimated cost of $16 billion. The government has committed itself to, and announced, 14 Joint Strike Fighters. We expect the first two of those to be delivered to us in the United States for training purposes in the course of 2014-15.                  There are a number of advantages that Australia has in this project. Firstly, we sensibly chose the conventional variant and not the other two variants, which have been the subject of most difficulties so far as the program is concerned. Secondly, in working out our schedule and cost we put in sufficient padding to make sure that we did not suffer, most importantly, a capability gap. I was recently in the United States. I discussed this matter with Secretary of State for Defense Panetta; with Ash Carter, his assistant secretary on capability, who was recently the nominee for Deputy Secretary; and also with the Joint Strike Fighter program office itself, including Admiral Venlet.                 I made it clear that our concern was in the risk of rubbing up against our schedule. We are proposing, in conjunction with our Joint Strike Fighter program partners, to do an exhaustive assessment of the delivery schedule by the end of this year. The advice I have from my department is that we are in a position to wait until 2013 to make a judgment about whether alternative arrangements are required to ensure there is no gap in our capability. I am not proposing to wait until the last minute. I am proposing to recommend to the government that we make that decision next year.                  There is an obvious option, or plan B, which I have stated publicly in the United States and on my return here.                     I have stated publicly in the United States and here that there is a viable alternative. Whilst the government has not committed itself to this, the obvious alternative is the Super Hornet. So I am proposing to recommend to government, in the course of next year, whether there is a need for us to take alternative steps to ensure there is no gap in our air combat capability.                 So far as cost is concerned, as I have said, we have committed ourselves to 14 at a cost of about $3 billion. What further orders, if any, are placed, will be a judgment for the government at the time. So far as cost is concerned the single biggest variable is whether the United States reduces the number of Joint Strike Fighters for its navy and its air force. That is something which we are also closely monitoring in the context of their defence budget difficulties and general budget difficulties. So far as the government is concerned we will not allow a gap to occur in our air combat capability.

  I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question. The clean energy future plan that the government announced on 10 July contains very significant support for jobs in key industries. The jobs and competitiveness program in particular provides very significant support for, and assistance to, industries in the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive sectors of the economy. This assistance, just in the first three years of the carbon price mechanism, represents $9.2 billion of assistance for those industries and, of course, it is an ongoing program.                 This program will be extremely important for the competitiveness of industries such as alumina refining, aluminium smelting, steel making and cement manufacturing. Industries under the Jobs and competitiveness program will be entitled to assistance in the form of free permits at the rates of 94Â½ per cent for the most emissions-intensive industries and 66 per cent for the moderately emissions-intensive industries. This will underpin the competitiveness of these industries by significantly offsetting their carbon liability. It will support the jobs of those employed in those industries and still, of course, maintain an incentive to reduce pollution and to invest in clean technology.                 The package also contains a number of other very important measures: an $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program for manufacturing businesses, a $200 million clean technology program for manufacturing businesses specifically in the metal-forging and food-processing industries and a $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program to support business investment in low-emissions research and development in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. In relation to small business there will be an increased small business instant asset write-off, which has been increased to $6,500 for depreciating assets.                 These are just some of the important programs announced by the government to support jobs and competitiveness. It is important that they are also appropriately represented in the debate. There are other measures, including approximately $1.3 billion to support jobs in the most methane-intensive coal mines and a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan.                 But, of course, none of these measures will deter the Leader of the Opposition, it seems, from his campaign of fear and misrepresentation. He has run around the country trying to terrify people in a completely unprincipled, opportunistic and irresponsible manner. He has declared repeatedly that entire industries will be destroyed and that towns and regions will be wiped off the map. It is disreputable to undermine people's job security in this way, and it is disreputable to damage consumer sentiment in our economy with these claims.                 On the point of order: the last part of this question was, 'How has the government's policy been received, and what is the government's response?' Without marking people's homework, that is code for the type of answer that we are now seeing. If there were no debate allowed in responses there would not be a problem. But that is not something that the House has addressed at this stage. I will listen carefully to the minister's concluding remarks, and I know that he knows he is required to relate his material directly to the question.                     The fundamental problem here in the debate is that the Leader of the Opposition will say anything to anyone as long as it suits him at the time.                     He will tell one audience that he is committed to the five per cent bipartisan target and on the very same day turn around and tell a seniors group that it is crazy; one thing to one person and another to another. He calls for a people's revolt and then counsels his own party for measured debate.                     The Leader of the Opposition's word is worthless.

  I thank the member for Throsby for the question. In thinking about the coal seam methane industry, let us first be clear: this is not a new industry to Australia. On the east coast of Australia the coal seam methane industry, from a domestic point of view, currently represents 30 per cent of our east coast gas supply. In Brisbane alone it represents 90 per cent of the gas currently used. What is new to Australia is a world first - potentially the first ever world export contracts from the LNG industry. That represents $45 billion in new investment for Australia. Yes, there is some foreign investment, but, importantly, there are two leading Australian companies in partnership with international investors, Santos and Origin - ordinary Australians investing in their future, side by side with international investment.                 But, importantly, that $45 billion in new investment also represents, for the state of Queensland out of those three projects to date, 15,000 new jobs not only in Gladstone but in a number of regional communities that are struggling to rebuild themselves because of the challenges that have confronted the agricultural sector in recent decades. When I went to Chinchilla last August to open a new local apprenticeship training centre, the young apprentices I met and their parents were absolutely delighted with our investment in support of the industry and new apprenticeship opportunities. The parents spoke about the opportunities now to train locally, to be employed locally and to sustain those local communities. I should also remind the House that, in terms of royalties, they will principally go to the state of Queensland, because they are onshore resource developments. That means a greater opportunity for Queensland to invest in those regional communities in funding health, education and infrastructure, just to name a few of the basic requirements that those local communities expect.                 What really disappoints the Australian community is the endeavour by the opposition time and time again to talk down the Australian economy. That is what we have seen: rank political opportunism over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition. Members of the gallery should listen: if you walk out of question time today, run into Tony Abbott and say something to him, he will agree with you. He will then walk to the next group of people, they will say the exact opposite and he will agree with them. That is what we have on the other side of the House. This is very serious. We are very fortunate as a nation at the moment, with $45 billion in new investment in the coal seam methane industry and an investment pipeline of $440 billion. We also had the Leader of the Opposition last Friday not only challenging the constitutional capacity of the state and territory governments to regulate this very important industry but also saying to foreign investors, 'You are not welcome in Australia.' It is about time he understood that the history of Australia is that we are a trading nation built on the back of foreign investment. Companies such as Shell, Chevron and BP are investing in Australia and creating real jobs. So it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition fronted up to his responsibilities and stopped going around Australia talking about his so-called policy mix, which is nothing but populism masquerading as policy. He is a rank political opportunist and nothing but an economic vandal who has clearly shown yet again that he has no understanding of the functions of the Australian economy.

  Of course, I can confirm for the member who asked the question that the emissions trading scheme that we will reach after a three-year fixed price period will be an internationally linked scheme - absolutely. Yes, it will, because our nation is linked to the world. You have just heard the Minister for Resources and Energy talk about our history as a great trading nation. We live in a global economy. So, as we transform our economy to a clean energy future, we will ensure through international linking that we can get abatement in carbon pollution at the least cost, and that is achieved through international linking. Anyone who puts the contrary view to you is saying to you that we should transform our economy at a higher cost - that is, we should ask Australian businesses to pay more than they need to and put more on our economy than we need to for this transformation. Looking at the policies of the opposition in this regard, I think -                      Of course, what we are hearing from the opposition - and here we go again - are a set of misrepresentations about the way in which carbon pricing works - just as they misrepresented what would happen about coal, just as they misrepresented what would happen about steel, just as they misrepresented what would happen about the cost of living, just as they have misrepresented, every step of the way, every aspect of this scheme. Here we go again. The question that was asked by the member went to international linking. Let me explain to him: yes, it is a linked scheme because that enables us to reduce carbon pollution at the least possible cost. There was a period when the opposition understood this and I refer them to the words of their spokesperson who said:                 We have unashamedly tried to source the cheapest abatement because once verified, a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon. And that is all that the planet knows.                 Because of the usual cheap politics we see, when the opposition or one of its spokespersons is in front of an audience where they think that is going to be a good message or they are in front of perhaps a business audience and they want to explain that their policy is about cheap abatement, they will say something about that. But then in a community meeting, when they think they might get away with stoking some fears about the rest of the world, they say something different. For example, the Leader of the Opposition said in complete contradiction of his spokesperson:                 Our five per cent target is to be achieved entirely within Australia, no taxpayers' funds would be spent overseas under the policy we announced.                 What the Leader of the Opposition did not go on to say is: if you do not have international linking the cost per tonne of abatement is higher. Consequently to reach the bipartisan targets of five per cent, the cost per tonne of abatement paid under the opposition's policy would be greater than under the government's policy.                     It is that that leads to the calculation that the opposition's policy would cost Australian families $1,300. We used to use a lower figure of $720 until they ruled out international linking and that is what made that figure $1,300. The Leader of the Opposition stands for abatement at the greatest possible cost. We stand for a modern economy, a clean energy future and getting there in the cheapest possible way.

  I thank the member for Banks for his interest in this topic. Members know that two pieces of legislation have been introduced into this House that will deliver the world's first plain packaging for tobacco products here in Australia. This is likely to be debated in the House next week. Of course, it was with interest that we read reports today that the Liberal Party have made a decision formally within their party room that they will support one of those bills, but they will not support the other bill. I am disappointed to hear this.                 This reform is about the public health impact of smoking - that is, that we reduce the number of people in this country who smoke as much as we can and we reduce methods for tobacco companies to be able to advertise and promote their products to new smokers - and it has been supported by everybody in the public health community. The health professions across the country have supported us, including the AMA. I understand both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition - as well as others, including me - are attending the AMA's dinner tonight. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition might be interested to know that the AMA awarded the government their annual tobacco award this year for this particular initiative. So it is disappointing to hear that the Leader of the Opposition is going to lead his party to a position where they will support part of plain packaging, but cannot quite bring themselves to support all of it.                  We know that the Leader of the Opposition has never been a true believer in this measure. He had to be dragged kicking and screaming by backbenchers in his own party who understood the importance of this measure. But now we have another example, like the one Minister Combet used, of the Leader of the Opposition saying one thing to one group of people and another thing to another group of people. Today he is actually saying two things at the same time to the same group of people - that is, he supports plain packaging and he does not support plain packaging!                 We have two bills in place because we need to make sure that the plain packaging restrictions are clearly articulated and we need to make changes to the trademarks legislation. We have seen all sorts of protests in the media that this is an outrage, that the parliament has never seen such a reaction before and that somehow these regulations are going to be different to every other regulation and they are not going to come to parliament. But before the members opposite lock into supporting the Leader of the Opposition's position and voting against one of these bills, I think they might need to do a little bit of research. I am disappointed that the member for Leichhardt is not in the chamber when I say this because he is one of the members who would remember that in 2000 the Howard government, Mr Entsch and others, introduced a piece of legislation amending the Trade Marks Act in exactly the same way to make sure that trademarks legislation could operate effectively in an area where we know industry practice changes very quickly and quick responses by regulation are required.                 This is a standard procedure. It is an important part of the plain packaging legislation. It is ironic that this would be opposed by those opposite when it is actually about making sure trademark laws are retained. You have to wonder whether the 97 per cent of donations coming through to the Liberal and National parties are actually buying something here. They are going to support part of the plain packaging legislation, but they are not going to support the other part. Is this what big tobacco are getting for their money?

  Here we once again have the opposition trying to induce confusion and continuing its campaign of misrepresentation against carbon pricing. We saw it in the last parliamentary session, we saw it across the winter recess and of course we are seeing it again in question time today. It is exactly the same type of misrepresentation we saw when the Leader of the Opposition was saying that coal would be out of business - he was wrong - and steel would be out of business - and he was wrong. He said that cost of living increases would be astronomical - and he was wrong. We have seen all of this play out day after day.                 To the member's question, what I would say, of course, is that the scheme has been designed so that it is the generators of the most pollution, the biggest polluters, who pay. It has been designed to do that. If the member who asked the question somehow now has a perspective that the scheme should be more broadly based then that would truly be an eccentric move by the opposition. But, given we have heard different things on different occasions about all aspects of the scheme, I am not surprised. What the calculation about the amount of carbon pollution relates to is the amount of carbon pollution generated at a site. What happens is that, in terms of the carbon pollution, a price is paid, and businesses will adapt, they will innovate and they will reduce the amount of carbon pollution.                 The member then seems to conclude that all of this somehow adds up to less economic growth. The Leader of the Opposition has apparently finally found the detailed documents about carbon pricing. I would refer the member who asked the question to those detailed documents because of what they show - that is, continued economic growth -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have actually got this document and I am going to go to it in one second, so thank you very much for drawing attention to that.                     What I was saying was that the member should refer to the detailed documents about carbon pricing. He seems to have assumed that somehow our economy will cease to grow. Of course, that is completely untrue. Our economy will grow and there will be 1.6 million more jobs between now and 2020.                 Given the member has taken an interest in this matter, I would refer him to his own policy, which says:                 Businesses that undertake activity with an emissions level above their 'business as usual' levels will incur a financial penalty. The value of penalties will be on a sliding scale at levels commensurate with the size of the business and the extent to which they exceed their 'business as usual' levels.                 So, to the member who has asked the question, am I to assume that he is now campaigning against the coalition's so-called direct action policy, because it would be as consistent as anything else the coalition has done on carbon pricing.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question and for his dedication through his entire professional career to sound economic policy, a consistency that he has demonstrated that has been sadly lacking from those opposite. Today I can report that Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a policy decision to allow the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. This decision -                      Dr EMERSON:                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. The decision is subject to a set of strict, science based conditions set at arms-length from government by the Director of Quarantine. New Zealand had taken a dispute against Australia to the World Trade Organisation and the World Trade Organisation ruled in November of last year that Australia's quarantine measures were not supported by science. The Gillard government is making the right decision in implementing this science based advice. Any attempt to prevent the implementation of this decision would be extremely damaging to Australian farmers. If Australia does not fully comply with the decision of the World Trade Organisation, Australian farmers will be exposed to retaliation by New Zealand. Australia exported $8 billion worth of goods to New Zealand last year. New Zealand could retaliate against any Australian products, and they would be able to raise their tariffs on Australian goods by up to 100 per cent. For example, New Zealand could choose to target the $110 million worth of sugar that we send to New Zealand every year; New Zealand could target the $10 million worth of citrus fruit we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $19 million worth of pig meat we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $18 million worth of beef we send to New Zealand; or New Zealand could target our exports of stone fruit, wine, grapes or vegetables. New Zealand could target the $39 million worth of chocolate that Tasmania sends to New Zealand. The World Trade Organisation rules matter - they actually matter.                 I know that the Leader of the National Party does not believe World Trade Organisation rules matter, but they do - and accepted science matters. We must have a quarantine system based on science and not on the whims of politicians. Australia has actually used the WTO rules to defeat import restrictions on Australian beef and sugar. Australia is a major agricultural exporter, with more than 60 per cent of our agricultural production destined for the world export market. By refusing to comply with the global trading rules, Australia would be jeopardising its valuable export markets and the livelihoods of the farmers who depend upon them. I ask the coalition to consider that very seriously.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. This government is serious about supporting families and has delivered a number of improvements over the last four years to make sure that Australian families are getting more support. We understand just how important it is for families, as they sit down every fortnight to balance their family budgets, that they have some certainty about what is going to happen into the future.                  One thing that families can be sure about is that this government will deliver next year around $20 billion combined through the family tax benefit, the baby bonus and paid parental leave. Families can also be certain that they will receive a number of improvements that this government has put in place. This government has put in place the 50 per cent childcare rebate; paid parental leave; the education tax refund; and, very importantly for families with older teenagers, from 1 January next year a higher rate of family tax benefit part A for those families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full-time secondary study. Of course, none of these improvements were put in place by the previous Liberal government.                 I am asked about risks to Australian families. The biggest risk to family budgets is coming from this Leader of the Opposition. Every single person in this chamber today knows that this Leader of the Opposition will do anything for a sound bite on the six o'clock news. While this government was working very hard during the budget to deliver a sustainable footing for our family payments system, everybody will recall that this Leader of the Opposition during the budget reply had that little sound bite about 'forgotten families'. But then when it came to the vote in here, this Leader of the Opposition forgot about them. He will say one thing at one point in time to one group of people and then of course, when it came to the vote in this House of Representatives, this Leader of the Opposition voted for the changes that the government had put in the budget - exactly the same performance in this budget that this Leader of the Opposition went along with back in 2009.                 We know that exactly the same behaviour has taken place from this Leader of the Opposition when he said, I am sure people will remember, that under any government -                      Everyone will recall this Leader of the Opposition going out on the six o'clock news telling people that there would be no new taxes on business under a government that he led. There would be no new taxes on business and then a few days later this Leader of the Opposition announced a great big new tax to pay for his paid parental leave scheme.

  I would say to the member who asked the question that, once again, this is a misrepresentation by the opposition. I doubt the printing business that he refers to, if it is carbon neutral, is amongst the 500 biggest polluters in this country, so it will not be paying a price per tonne. The question, as it is phrased, is an attempt to mislead the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Lyons for the question and note his strong interest in the Carbon Farming Initiative and the extra lines of income it can provide for land use. During the break the government, through the National Reserve System, was responsible for the largest parcel of land ever purchased through the National Reserve System. Together with RM Williams, we contributed $9.1 million to a $13 million purchase price to convert Henbury Station to what will be the world's largest carbon farm.                 On Henbury station, what RM Williams are wanting to do is effectively provide a template, a canvas, where they can, through trial and error, work through the best way to drive business models for carbon farming. What this will provide is an extra line of income and effectively a massive demonstration project that other large pastoralists and other farmers will be able to look at. It is using some of the best accountancy advice available.                 It was interesting to listen to the earlier exchanges when people were talking about which way investment goes through international linking. Just before question time I received a text message from David Pearse, who has been responsible for the project for RM Williams, who let me know that they have already been approached about international linking by major European insurance companies wanting to invest in carbon in Australia because of the Carbon Farming Initiative - wanting to pay international permits and use them in Australia through the Carbon Farming Initiative.                 You would have thought that the concept of the Carbon Farming Initiative was something that may have provided some level of bipartisanship across the chamber, but no. Senator Nash, when this was announced, opposed the Henbury purchase. She opposed there on the Finke River Australia being involved in the world's largest carbon farm on the basis of the principles that had already been put by the Leader of the Opposition. He said we should not go to prime agricultural land and Senator Nash then described Henbury Station as an example of prime agricultural land.                 Can I make clear Henbury Station is in Central Australia. Henbury Station is in the red earth area, surrounded by desert, in Central Australia. The coalition are looking for where they are going to plant their trees. They are looking for an area five times the size of Tasmania, they are looking for an area roughly the size of Germany but they have ruled out the Darling Downs, they have ruled out New England, they have now ruled out all of the desert and they have now ruled out all of Central Australia. Where will their trees go? Where is the concept of carbon farming? There is a limit to how many trees the Leader of the Opposition can plant at Manly Beach. There is a limit to how well trees will grow if they decide to plant them in the oceans. Once you start describing the entire continent as 'prime agricultural land' you are effectively saying that anything that goes to carbon sequestration is off the agenda. You can also add inside that black hole where sits $70 billion their entire direct action policy.

  I am seriously suggesting that it is inappropriate for the opposition to phrase questions or make statements which mislead people about who is liable to pay a price per tonne for carbon pollution. That is what that question did. It sought to mislead on who was liable for paying the carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is very committed to the mining industry and, indeed, sharing the prosperity of the mining boom throughout Australia. The minerals resource rent tax is about a fair deal for all Australians from Australia's non-renewable natural resources. It is a very good idea. We have an unprecedented boom in the mining industry. This is due, of course, to the ongoing rise of Asian economies. We have the highest terms of trade in 140 years. Eventually the penny will drop with the opposition that this mining boom is extraordinary, the likes of which we have never seen before.                 Whilst this mining boom is bringing great benefits for many within the mining industry, we are also seeing at the same time a patchwork economy. Not all of Australia is going as well as the mining sector. It is important when we have benefits from the mining boom that we share the prosperity across the whole Australian economy. That is why when the Gillard government introduces the mining resource rent tax it is our intention to pass on the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. That is why we want to lower corporate tax to 29 per cent. That is why we want to raise compulsory superannuation for all Australians from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is why we want to have better infrastructure across the whole of this continent to make sure that all can benefit. That is why we want simplified taxes for all Australians.                 The question I was asked also talked about inconsistency. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that miners are paying too much tax. He said it on his radio station of choice, 2GB, on 26 May. He thinks the miners are paying more than their fair share of tax now. How can he think that when Rio Tinto, Xstrata and BHP have set new records for profits in this most extraordinary mining boom? The Leader of the Opposition also says that the mining resource rent tax will kill off the industry. He said it is guaranteed. He said that in a doorstop on 10 June. Yet in that same period we have seen mining capital expenditure go from $35 billion to $51 billion this year and forecast at over $80 billion next year.                 The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that raising this minerals resource rent tax is bad for the economy. On the contrary, we say to 2.7 million small businesses: 'This is good for you. We want you to share in the prosperity.' As much as the opposition do not like hearing about inconsistency, they always take the path of least resistance. When there is the option of lazy economics they are always first to the front of the queue. They would have you believe that, if they were to form the government of this nation, they would cut the mining taxes to the richest companies in Australia, yet sack 12,000 hardworking Commonwealth public servants. They would have you believe that raising superannuation to 12 per cent is a bad idea, but they pay themselves 15 per cent. Furthermore, they would have you believe that lowering corporate tax to 29 per cent is a bad idea, yet they would put a Coles and Woolworths tax on that clanger of an idea that you forecast.                 In fact, the only time when the opposition are not inconsistent was on the Funniest Home Videosnews clip on Saturday in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition looked everywhere but at the question. He was struck dumb. He was like a man in a round room looking for a corner.

  I have seen the media report that the Leader of the Opposition held up, and when you look at that media report it details so-called modelling performed by the Victorian government. But this so-called modelling does not take into account the billions and billions of dollars allocated through the carbon pricing package to protect Australian jobs.                 I think we should be very clear about what is happening here. The Council of Australian Governments is meeting tomorrow. I am intending, at the Council of Australian Governments, to speak to the state premiers and the chief ministers about our obligations as the nation's leaders during a time where Australians have seen turbulence on global markets. Many of them are understandably very concerned about what that means for them and their families: what that turbulence on global markets means for our nation.                 I will be saying to the state premiers and to the chief ministers that now is not the time for the playing of petty politics. Now is not the time for falsely raising alarm and concern. Now is the time when the nation's leaders should be speaking to the Australian community about the inherent strength of the Australian economy but also speaking to the Australian community about the pressure points in our economy. We floated our dollar in 1983. It first hit parity with the US dollar in November last year. And now, of course, because of our exceptionally strong terms of trade we are looking at a strong Australian dollar as far into the future as the eye can see.                 Yes, that does mean that there are pressures on some parts of the economy, and it does mean that we need to work with those sectors of the economy - and we will. But, of course, as we go about managing contemporary economic circumstances, what we need to do as this generation of the nation's leaders is have the same courage as earlier generations to stump up and get done the reforms that this nation needs so that it has prosperity tomorrow. ne of those reforms is putting a price on carbon, cutting carbon pollution and making sure we have the clean energy jobs of the future. If anybody is in doubt about the existence of those clean energy jobs then I suggest that they go to the Clean Energy Future display that is on in Parliament House today. There they will meet business people who have brought to Parliament House their clean energy innovations which are making money for them today and which will be the kind of clean energy technology that will make a long-term difference to our economy, creating the jobs of the future and bringing the innovation of the future.                 On the question of modelling projections for Victoria, let us be very clear about this: Treasury modelling projects the economy of Victoria will grow by 30 per cent to 2020 alone and by 162 per cent by 2050. The modelling shows that Victoria maintains strong growth under a carbon price with agriculture, construction and services growing by 120, 170 and 246 per cent respectively to 2050. Strong growth, more jobs - that is Victoria's future.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. When the nation's leaders meet together tomorrow at the Council of Australian Governments what I expect that meeting to do is to work cooperatively on implementing the health reform agreement that we have recently signed - all states and territories coming together to reform the nation's hospital system. We will be announcing tomorrow, out of the Council of Australian Governments meeting, some important implementation measures. We will be announcing the chairs of the National Health Performance Authority and we will be announcing the chair of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. These bodies are critical to the reform of the hospital system as they will be there to provide greater accountability and transparency, and oversee the activity being undertaken in the nation's hospitals.                 I had the opportunity last night to address the dinner of the Australian Medical Association. Whilst I was there I had the opportunity to outline the way in which health reform will change our health system for the future and that this is a once-in-a-generation reform of the size and scale of Medicare. What these reforms do is buttress our central principle of universality with the important principles of sustainability, transparency, high performance and value for money. This puts into our hospital system an extra $19.8 billion between now and 2020. It injects into the system $175 billion extra by 2030. Let us be very clear: this is extra; this is not money the Commonwealth was obligated to provide. It will make us forever an equal partner in the growth in hospital costs and that is appropriate. It will ensure that between 2014 and the end of the decade alone our new funding will deliver 2.9 million extra cases in emergency departments, two million additional inpatient services and 19 million additional outpatient consultations.                 This new money for these services being provided is associated with a profound reform agenda. We have secured the right to expect that every service is now delivered at an efficient price. We have secured the right to track where every dollar, state and federal, goes via the national health funding pool. We have secured the right to expect the health system's performance to be reported and available transparently not just to government but to ordinary Australians, so that they can see that reported by an umpire without fear or favour. And we have secured the right to the creation of local hospital networks; more local control, as is appropriate.                 The significance of these reforms cannot be underestimated. We have secured these reforms in circumstances where we were able to see politics put to one side. It would have been easy for people to assume political divisions between the Commonwealth and the states would kill the prospect for enduring reform. It would have been easy to continue the blame game. It would have been easy to give money to the states via a blank cheque. But we have not gone down that low road because that low road is not an option in health. When it comes to health we will always do the right thing. It may be a very difficult thing to achieve, but we have achieved this health reform agreement and tomorrow we will take steps on its implementation.

  In relation to the member's question, our perspective about the future of the Latrobe Valley - and I have been there to explain it to people myself; I had a long meeting with a large number of workers at the Hazelwood power station, for example -                      is that it has a very strong future and we will be working with the local community to achieve that. What I said when I was in the Latrobe Valley meeting with workers at the Hazelwood power station, local community members, representatives of the local council and the like was that our carbon pricing package includes a closure-for-tender process. We as a government will be calling a tender where those generators that are the dirtiest generators in the country - that is, they generate the most carbon pollution - can come forward with a proposal which we will assess on value-for-money criteria.                     What I was explaining to the member and to the House - it was exactly the same thing I explained to the workers in the Latrobe Valley when I spoke to them personally - was that we would go through this contract for closure process, it would take a number of years, and obviously we would work with any regions affected with structural adjustment because we want every region in the country to have a bright future.                    -                       The member who is now interjecting may want to direct his attention to our Clean Energy Future package, our carbon pricing package, and he will see there allocated $200 million for structural adjustment purposes.                 The point of going through this, and my visit to the Latrobe Valley, is to verify that no matter where I am - whether I am in this parliament, in front of workers from a power station or talking to people who are very passionate about climate change and reducing carbon pollution - I say the same thing. And I think that that is appropriate. What I do not think is appropriate - and it bears directly on the member's question about jobs - is for the opposition to say different things to different audiences. So we have the shadow minister for finance, who says that the policy of the opposition is the closure of the Hazelwood power station. And then the Leader of the Opposition, when he was out there trying to be a friend of the workers - when he was in that guise, which is completely contrary to his 'friend of business' guise, completely contrary to his 'friend of farmers' guise and completely contrary to his 'friend of those passionate about climate change' guise - then said:                 There will be no act of policy from the next Coalition government or from any Coalition government that I'm associated with that artificially foreshortens the life of these power stations.                 The only way that these statements make sense is if the shadow minister is envisaging a situation where the Leader of the Opposition is not associated with a future coalition government. I will allow them to explain that.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I was delighted to be able to visit her, the member for Lindsay and the member for Reid last week to have a look at how health reform is already delivering to Western Sydney. Of course, the national health reforms that are being implemented, as the Prime Minister mentioned, are turning into very real services right across the country. In Western Sydney our health reforms will deliver an extra 232 beds, and 150 of those are already open. So I was able to visit, with the member for Greenway, Blacktown Hospital. They are going to have 48 extra beds - 18 of those are already open and providing services to the local community. I went with the member for Lindsay to Nepean Hospital, where the $96 million investment means that the new ICU has opened this week and 26 of the 36 new beds are already open, providing services to that fast-growing community.                 Of course, we are also increasing transparency, as the Prime Minister mentioned, for the performance of our hospitals - a measure that the opposition voted against yesterday in this House. From October this year for the first time the MyHospitals website will report infection rates at hospitals across the country. And yesterday we passed through this House legislation for the first national performance authority on health to be established. It will report not just on hospital services but also on services in both public and private hospitals and in Medicare Locals.                 From all of this it is clear to Australians across the country what Labor is delivering in terms of health reform. It is clear when you look at our history what we believe about health - in terms of investing in Medicare, being the creators of Medicare and the creators of the PBS and now introducing these health reforms - but it is very hard to understand where it is that the Liberal Party stand on health reforms. They opposed the performance bill yesterday. They have not released any policies at all, and the Leader of the Opposition -                      The Leader of the Opposition did give us a little bit of a clue about the approach that he might take if he were ever to hold the office of Prime Minister. He said last night to the AMA: 'You all know what I was like as health minister. That's what I'll be like as the Prime Minister.' So let's just have a look at what that means.                     It may be that those opposite do not want to remember what the Leader of the Opposition was like as the health minister, but the public will. They remember a billion dollars coming out of our hospitals. They remember a cap on GP training places. They remember that six out of 10 Australians could not access a GP easily when they needed one. They remember him, when he was the health minister, insulting a man dying of asbestosis. They remember what he was like, and that is what he would be like as the Prime Minister, if ever he got the chance.                 If the Leader of the Opposition wants to say, 'That's what I'll be like,' where are the next set of health cuts coming from if he gets into government? We are clear where we stand on health. Where does the Leader of the Opposition stand on health?

  To the member who asked the question - we can see they have all got the same lines to chant today, which will probably be quite different from what they say tomorrow - what I would say is, first and foremost, my very clear recollection is that the so-called modelling you refer to, which I believe you probably saw in newspaper reports, was actually modelling on an earlier carbon pricing package. The so-called modelling was done not on the basis of the package that we announced and certainly not on the basis of the industry assistance measures that are in the carbon pricing package that we announced.                 I would say to the member I think he has got a real responsibility to make sure that he tells people in his community the truth about the impact of carbon pricing, because I know that there have been attempts to mislead them. The member comes from a great coalmining district and there have been very direct attempts to mislead people who work in coalmining. The Leader of the Opposition was there one day at a Peabody mine saying to anybody who would listen that the coalmining industry had no future and it was going to be shut down. He was tremendously embarrassed when, the very next day, the very company whose jacket he had had on announced a major takeover, the biggest ever Australian takeover bid for an Australian company, because they saw such a long-term profitable future in mining coal.                 So there have been all of these false claims made by members of the opposition and, yes, of course I expect that Liberal Party premiers will be following in their footsteps, in the lead-up to the Council of Australian Governments meeting, and trying to help their friends on that side of the House. But the member who asked the question should not confuse that with the truth. He should not confuse the Liberal Party's scare campaign with the truth, because we know it is not the truth.                 With a price on carbon, our economy will continue to grow. With a price on carbon, there will be 1.6 million new jobs by 2020. With a price on carbon, coalmining will continue to grow. With a price on carbon -                      He is still making misrepresentations about coalmining.                     With a price on carbon, we will see a strong economic future for our country - and, of course, that economic future will be strengthened because we will seize the clean energy sources of the future.                 I would remind the member who asked the question, and I know that there are often attempts by the opposition to obscure this part of the debate, that most days of the week there is actually a bipartisan target between both sides of politics to cut carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. Some days of the week the Leader of the Opposition walks away from it, but most days of the week he endorses it. Consequently, in this whole debate we are asking ourselves two questions: when to start and how to do it? Well, I am for starting soon and doing it in the most cheap way possible. You are for starting late and doing it in the most expensive way possible.                 You come into this parliament with challenges about economic prosperity. Well, let me be very, very clear. The worst possible thing we could do for the Australian economy is start late, with expensive abatement, and then put on an extra tax of $1,300 per household to pay for it - your plan. We will keep with our plan: starting on 1 July, doing it in the cheapest possible way, a growing economy and more jobs.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for what is a very important question because the MRRT only taxes highly profitable mines, irrespective of whether they are big or small. I am aware of the study by the University of Western Australia and I have had the Treasury have a look at that study. I am more than happy to have Treasury officials brief the member on their conclusions about what that study means, which do not accord with the conclusions which have been drawn by the member today. o the Treasury does not accept the conclusion that there is a discrimination against small miners in the system. In fact, we have explicitly set out to remove small miners from the system, and we have done that in a way that is acceptable to the great bulk of the industry. We have been through extensive consultation with the mining industry over this issue. The legislation will come to the parliament later this year. It is perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation that this parliament will deal with in this term. It is important that all Australians receive a fair return for the resources they own - 100 per cent returns which are coming from a mining boom - so that we can assist others elsewhere in the economy, in particular those in the patchwork economy, for example, because they are not in the fast lane of the mining boom.                 So the revenue that will come from the MRRT, which is paid only by the highly profitable companies regardless of whether they are big or small, will be used to give tax cuts to all companies right across Australia. There could not be a better time for that to be happening - to give a tax cut to many of those companies that are not in the fast lane, most particularly to give a significant tax cut to those struggling small businesses out there. The instant asset write-off is a very important tax cut that is coming to small businesses - 2.7 million of them - courtesy of the fact that we are in a position to ensure that Australians get a fair return for the resources they own 100 per cent. In addition to that, we can make important investments in infrastructure, particularly in those regions where mining is strong and where there are capacity constraints.                 That is why I say this is a very important discussion. The legislation coming up in the House later this year is absolutely critical to our future economic development, to strengthening our economy and to supporting jobs, particularly in small business. I am more than happy to sit down with the member and more than happy to have the Treasury sit down with the member to take him through our conclusions about that modelling, which demonstrate that the MRRT delivers a fair return to the Australian people and that that money is going to go back into important investments, not just in mining communities but right around Australia, to help small businesses in the whole community.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question, because he and the member for Greenway, who asked the previous question, have been absolutely passionate advocates of health services in their electorates, not just in lobbying and arguing for investments in their local hospitals but also in e-health, in the Medicare Locals and in obesity programs like the Stephanie Alexander kitchen program. All of these projects are rolling out in their communities as we speak.                 It is not surprising that members on this side of the House have been pleased by, and acknowledged and seen the benefits of, our early investments when we were elected to office - a 50 per cent increase in health expenditure compared to that paid by the previous government. Of course, then there are the historic reforms negotiated by the Prime Minister - another nearly $20 billion that is going into the system, with $3.4 billion of that right now. It is hard not to make the comparison that all these extra investments in beds, in GP services and in extra clinics, compared with when you pull money out of the system, are delivering benefits to patients -                      I think the members opposite do not want to hear about the past. Let us just talk about the promises that were made at the last election, because the promises that the Liberal Party took to the last election actually included a whole new raft of cuts to health services.                     GP superclinics were to be cut, the after-hours GP helpline was to be cut, e-health was to be cut, funding for GP practices was to be cut and funding for activity based funding was to be cut. If these were the promises made at the last election, and now we know the Liberal Party is looking for $70 billion worth of savings -                      let me just take the House through what that would mean in health: $70 billion worth of savings would mean that we cannot pay at all a Commonwealth contribution for the next four years for any hospital service in the country. That means 40 per cent of all hospitals would close, 20,000 hospital beds would close -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. Obviously it is important for members of the House and the public to understand just how much money the Commonwealth does invest in various different health services. If people want to know, if you are trying to get to a total of $70 billion, the government would have to make a decision that not a single Medicare payment would be paid to any patient in the next four years. Or, as an alternative, what we could do is that, if you totally abolish the PBS and you totally abolish the private health insurance rebate, you still would only get to $58 billion. You still would not make the $70 billion that the Liberal Party are scratching around for. Last night, the Leader of the Opposition said to measure him on his record. His record in health was cutting services, and that is what he wants to do if he becomes the Prime Minister.

  In response to the member's question, yes, of course I have had a conversation with the member for Dobell. As I expressed in the parliament yesterday I have full confidence in him. I will happily repeat that today: I have full confidence in the member for Dobell.                 A declaration was made that is there and transparent. Yes, it is true that it was made late and, as I commented yesterday in this parliament and am happy to comment again, it is not the first late declaration that has ever been made in this parliament - but people should abide by the rules.

  I thank the member for Bass for a very important question, and one that is understood by everybody on this side of the House.                 The government has been methodically putting in place a range of policies to deal with the challenges and the opportunities of a patchwork economy. That is why we are so committed to a tax reform package which will come to this House later in the year and which will deliver tremendous benefits to the 2.7 million small businesses right around this country.                 We do understand how important it is to spread the opportunities of the mining boom right around our country, particularly to small businesses that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why we are so committed to the $6,500 instant asset write-off for multiple purchases by small businesses, to give them a real lift when it comes to their cash flow. That is very important for small business. It is the sort of tax reform that they have been looking for for years. It will be delivered by this government because we do understand the challenges of the patchwork economy.                 It will deliver something like $1 billion to small businesses in 2013-14 and, of course, it is opposed by all of those opposite, who do not understand the challenges of the patchwork economy. That is why we are particularly putting in place a range of policies to deal with skill shortages and to deal with labour supply, because we do understand that for many businesses in Australia getting the supply of labour that is required can, from time to time, be very difficult. That is why we are putting in place a National Workforce Development Fund - that is very important. That is why we had, as the centrepiece of the budget, a whole range of reforms to increase workforce participation.                 The one that I am most proud of, and which I know that everybody behind me is proud of, is the fact that we have increased substantially the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,000. That is very important for second income earners in so many households right around this country. When they do work a few more extra hours they might get more in their hand. This is a fundamental reform that we have put in place but, once again, is opposed by those opposite.                 We have put in place a range of other measures to ensure that many of those who are out of the labour market have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get into the labour market, once again spreading the opportunity that flows from growth. So, that is what this government is committed to.                 We are committed to putting in place carbon pricing and to assisting industry, particularly the trade exposed industries, because we understand that to be a first-rate economy in the 21st century we do need to be powered substantially by clean energy. We are doing all of these things to grow our economy and to respond to the challenges from a patchwork economy.                 But, of course, those on that side of the House just continue to talk our economy down. They talk it down whilst they are digging a $70 billion black hole in their budget estimates - $70 billion. We have a plan to cut company tax; they have a plan to send it up. We have a plan to increase tax cuts to small business; they are opposing those. But, most importantly, we have in place strict fiscal rules and they have a $70 billion hole in their estimates.                     A $70 billion hole; and you do not find $70 billion, shadow Treasurer, by putting your hand down the inside of the couch and finding it there beside all the chocolate wrappers.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Yes, earlier this year, working alongside the Treasurer, the finance minister and my cabinet colleagues, I had to work out how, responsibly, we were going to finance the rebuilding of the nation and most particularly Queensland. We made the determination that we would do that by budget cutbacks and a large number of budget cutbacks were made. They were not easy but they were necessary to have the resources to rebuild Queensland and the rest of the nation. We also took what was not an easy decision but was the right decision to impose a flood levy which would predominantly be paid by upper income earners and we brought that legislation to the parliament.                     At that time the opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition claimed -                    The member for Herbert then left the chamber.                     that this would destroy the economy, it would destroy families and it would destroy everything in Australia - and of course they have been proved absolutely wrong.                     The question drew a direct comparison between decision making earlier this year on the flood levy and that on carbon pricing and so I am addressing the first part of the question. In addressing the first part of the question, we saw a fear campaign from the opposition and now they do not even utter the words 'flood levy', as far as I can tell. I have not heard them utter them once since 1 July, when it came into effect. It was an opposition fear campaign that just fell away, the same way in which the carbon pricing fear campaign of the opposition falls away piece by piece as the inconsistencies and untruths in it are revealed. In terms of the necessary decisions in relation to the budget, what we said, at the time of the announcement of the carbon pricing package, was that all of the figures were there for people to see and that we would do the necessary updating in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.                     What I would also say to the shadow Treasurer - who seems very interested in these matters and is now, quite remarkably, saying to me, 'Where are the savings' - is that when we announce the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook you will see yet again this government making savings. I would invite the shadow Treasurer on the same day to publish the opposition's figures including how they are going to cover the $70 billion black hole. If the shadow Treasurer is seriously interested in matters of fiscal consolidation and fiscal prudence then I think he will jump to the challenge and the opportunity to publish all of his figures on the same day as the government, including accounting for the $70 billion black hole. I would be very interested to see where the cutbacks are coming from, whether it is from pensions, hospitals, Medicare or defence. That $70 billion is the same as not paying the age pension for two years. Maybe that will be one of the Leader of the Opposition's decisions, but I will be very keen to see the facts and figures of it.

  I thank the member for Newcastle for her question because she, like me, was responsible for convening a forum in the Hunter.                     I thank again the member for Newcastle for her question. We convened a forum together in the Hunter to talk about the opportunities. This was one of 10 forums that were convened in the intervening break since the time the parliament got up. In all of those 10 forums there are two common themes that have come through.                     One is the need for these economies to diversify their economic base and two is their preparedness to embrace a clean energy future. In all of these communities, on the second point in particular, they are already making the change. They are seeing the opportunities in a clean energy future rather than the threats that they hear from the other side. They have shown real and positive interest in the package that we have announced. Whether it is looking at the opportunities in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the clean technology programs, the jobs package, the Low Carbon Communities package, the Biodiversity Fund or Carbon Farming Initative packages, these are the opportunities they want to take because they have determined this agenda themselves. This is not imposed upon them; this is their agenda. They have determined the what and they are looking for assistance in the how. The package that has been announced by the Prime Minister provides that very assistance. One of these forums that I attended was actually in Whyalla. A couple of weeks before, the Leader of the Opposition had been to Whyalla and he had great news for Whyalla. He told Whyalla it would be wiped off the map. This was the rosy news he was giving Whyalla! That is not what the community in Whyalla was telling me. They saw real opportunity in this package for themselves. They are developing a green energy grid strategy. They have got a group that is looking for investment opportunities and skills. I visited two sites over there, a solar site which has a potential for in excess of 200 jobs and also a rare earths facility that has the opportunity of providing in excess of 1,000 jobs - hardly wiping them off the face of the earth.                 This is the problem that we are dealing with here: an opposition that simply wants to run a fear campaign because it has got no policy substance. Its policy has been ridiculed by everyone who has had a look at it. In that policy it was the Leader of the Opposition that was going to close the Hazelwood power station until he went down there and spoke to the workers and said, 'Oh no, I'm not closing your power station,' walking as usual on both sides of the street.                 Those redundancies at Loy Yang the Leader of the Opposition talked about before were announced back in March. This is old news, and trying to link it to the package is not just dishonest but running the fear campaign, which we will counter at every point and which we know the regional leadership will embrace.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. Yes, the documents that go with our carbon pricing package, including the modelling, show that it is an internationally linked scheme - and, yes, to the shadow minister who asked the question, I understand he is in favour of an internationally linked scheme. He has been on the public record in favour of such a scheme. When he was on the public record in favour of such a scheme he was on the public record for exactly the right reason, because what the shadow minister said himself was that you have an internationally linked scheme so you get carbon abatement at the lowest possible cost. Absolutely right. So the shadow minister used to support an internationally linked scheme.                 I understand it now appears to the opposition that it best suits their fear campaign to be out there saying, 'Ergh, shouldn't trade with foreigners!' I do not know whether they sit with Rio Tinto and say that we should not sell them resources or whether they sit with BHP and Rio Tinto and say, 'Let's not sell them coal or iron ore.' I do not know if they go to Toyota, Holden or any of those companies and say, 'Let's not export the cars that we make.' I do not know if they sit in the boardrooms of law firms -                      Mr Speaker, a point of order on a simple question of relevance: the question asked whether or not there would be $3Â½ billion spent on foreign carbon permits in 2020 and $57 billion in 2050.                     We are a great trading nation and I understand that the opposition now are engaged in a lot of populist nonsense. For example, we have seen them bring forward a bill which would take us outside of the global trading order with the consequence of retaliatory trade attacks. Somehow they are going to try and justify this to the Australian people. We know that, if we are outside the global rules based trading system and the subject of retaliatory attack, all that will mean is lost jobs for Australians. Now, in the climate change area, they are going down the same path. Yes, it is an internationally linked scheme, because that is the lowest cost abatement for the Australian economy and we want to make sure we transform our economy at the lowest cost. Because you have determined not to have an internationally linked scheme, your already excessively costly polluters subsidy policy has moved from a per household cost  -                      of $720 a year to a per household cost of $1,300 a year. We will do it in the most economically responsible way. It really amazes me that they can get the shadow minister to get up and ask these questions. It just goes to show how now throughout the opposition they have all succumbed to the Leader of the Opposition's culture that you will do or say anything in order to try and get political advantage, even if you said directly the opposite thing yesterday. I refer to the shadow minister's statements at a press conference of 10 July 2011:                 I'll just make a brief point. Our emissions reduction fund is a very simple proposition. We will purchase the lowest cost abatement wherever it may occur _                 In his National Press Club speech of 10 February 2010 he said:                 _ a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon. And that is all the planet knows.                 That was said by the shadow minister. Never was a truer word spoken.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As she knows, this Labor government is serious about helping families to support their family budgets. Also, most importantly, we have made sure we give newborn babies in families the best start in life by delivering Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. It was, of course, this Labor government that made sure that families, when they have a new baby coming into their home, can now get financial support to have a parent - a mum or a dad - stay at home with their newborn baby. I can let the House know that, since the scheme was introduced on 1 January this year, we have had 85,000 Australian families claim under the scheme - 85,000 Australian families who have benefited. Right now we have more than 33,000 Australian families currently benefiting from our Paid Parental Leave scheme.                 Of course, as those babies grow up, it is this Labor government that has improved support to the families where those babies are getting the benefits. They are getting the benefits of the extra childcare benefit and the childcare tax rebate that is now at 50 per cent compared to the lower figure that existed under the opposition. Of course, we have introduced the education tax refund, which is also delivering to parents to help with the costs of their children's education. Very importantly - and this was never delivered by those opposite - we are making sure that, for those families that have older teenagers, from 1 January next year we will deliver much-needed additional assistance to those families. We will see around 650,000 teenagers who are staying at school getting extra support for their parents over the next five years. All of this demonstrates that this government is very serious about supporting families.                 Of course, families know that the biggest risk to their budgets comes in the shape of this Leader of the Opposition. They know that this Leader of the Opposition went out with a thought bubble of a policy a couple of years ago - his paid parental leave policy, which was described by Heather Ridout as 'the sort of policy you have when you're not serious about having a policy'. That is exactly what this Leader of the Opposition is saying to families. He is saying to families that he intends to take $70 billion out of the budget. That is equivalent to 3Â½ years worth of family payments. That is what $70 billion is worth, and that is why Australian families have a lot to fear from this Leader of the Opposition.

  The Gillard government is indeed driving these historic reforms in the area of infrastructure and transport in Australia as part of creating a seamless national economy and as part of our productivity reform agenda. Tomorrow at COAG they will be considering the proposals in the intergovernmental agreements to move from 23 transport regulators down to three. There are real economic benefits for the nation, with a boost to national income of $30 billion over the next 20 years as a result of these historic reforms. For railways it means getting rid of seven separate regulatory authorities and 46 different pieces of state, territory and Commonwealth legislation, including seven rail safety acts, nine OHS acts and seven dangerous goods acts. Heavy vehicle operators will not have to deal with nine separate regulatory regimes to deal with their industry, supporting productivity and efficiency for operators. It will see one maritime regulator replacing 50 separate pieces of maritime legislation and seven separate state and territory regulators, each with overlapping and confusing regulation.                  The benefits to these reforms to our national productivity are clear, and that is why the business community is sending a very loud, clear and unambiguous message to state and territory leaders, which is to sign on to these reforms tomorrow. There have been 10 separate meetings of the Australian Transport Council. We have crossed every 't' and dotted every 'i'. It is time for this reform. It is 100 years too late, but it is time to get this reform done. We are indeed back on track. This will be absolutely vital for getting rid of anomalies which are there. In rail, for example, red over green means caution in one state and full speed ahead in the state next door. There are different weights that are allowed on our heavy vehicles. The amount of hay you can put on the back of a truck in Victoria is different if the truck is in New South Wales and different again if it is in South Australia. If you operate, for example, in the Sunraysia region, then there is very confusing regulation there.                 This is important reform. The opposition talked about this but did nothing about it for 12 years. We are going to get it done. In the maritime area, in which there has been some push back this week, I say this to state and territory leaders: if, for example, you are operating a commercial vessel in the gulf between the Northern Territory and Queensland, every time you cross the territorial waters you require different certification for the vessel and certification being redone for the staff of that commercial vessel. This is absurd in 2011. There are major gains: $30 billion over 20 years. This government has worked very hard to get the state and territories to the line where every transport minister throughout the country signed up at the ATC meeting in May. Tomorrow it is time for the premiers and the chief ministers to join with the national government in giving business the big win that it needs.

  I can absolutely confirm to the member that, as we announced, household petrol is out. It does not have the direct impacts from carbon pricing. We made a determination to do that and it is different to the earlier Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Yes, of course there are flow-through impacts for rail, and I think buses were the other example you used, and all of that has been taken into account in the provision of household assistance - that is, it has all been taken into account in the less than one per cent rise in the consumer price index, which is an impact of less than a dollar in $100. It has all been taken into account. Consequently, because we saw that there would be that consumer price impact, we determined to have household assistance and major tax reform with the carbon pricing package. The way in which that assistance will work is that 1.8 million pensioner households will on average come out $210 in front. That is above and beyond what they need to compensate them for the flow-through impacts of carbon pricing.                 People in the workforce who earn less than $80,000 per year will see a tax cut. We have associated that with major tax reform and the moving of the tax-free threshold from $6,000 per year to around $18,000 per year. What that means is that a million Australians will not have to fill in a tax return and many lower income Australians, people on a welfare-to-work journey or people who are second income earners will not see any tax taken from their pay packet. Week by week they will see the benefits of going to work. What these tax cuts also mean is that if you earn, say, $20,000 per year - many second income earners would, for example, because they work less than full time - you will see a tax cut of $600.                 We have made special arrangements for families with children, with family payments increasing up to $110 a year. Special arrangements have also been made for self-funded retirees. If they are part pensioners, then they will see the same increase in the pension as full pensioners. Many of them will get the tax cut. There is also a change in the senior Australians' tax offset, which is of benefit to them.                 So, if the member is interested in what things cost and the benefits that people get, I presume she would be desperately concerned that all of the assistance I have just referred to would be clawed back by the opposition.

  I thank the member for Makin, who I know shares this government's determination to ensure that, as we head towards a projected unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent, nobody gets left behind. This government is incredibly proud of the 750,000 jobs that have been created since we came to office. We know that they are having a very real impact on the lives of those individuals and also on the lives of their families and on their local communities. We are also determined to do more. We recognise the historic opportunity that we are now faced with: to reach out to those Australians who are on the margins, who are on welfare and not currently experiencing the benefits that come with having a job. Our government is very proud that, over the next four years, we will invest a record $8.5 billion in Australia's employment services. Importantly, this now includes some $3 billion for disability employment services. This provides the opportunity to assist those who have been sidelined from the workforce to share in the benefits of having a job - the disabled, mature-age job seekers and the very long-term unemployed. We are determined that they will come with us and enjoy these benefits.                 We are putting in place specific measures to assist this transition. As the Treasurer has mentioned, the increase in the tax-free threshold will have a major effect on the participation rate. But we have also announced some 35,000 wage subsidies for the long-term unemployed, new subsidies available through the Disability Employment Services, additional support and participation requirements to ensure that job seekers are job ready and able to take up these opportunities, and links through our mental health strategy to make sure that those suffering from mental ill-health are prepared for work. We are working with employers to remove misconceptions and discrimination which, sadly, exist within our community.                 On this side we are taking an innovative and effective approach to achieve our goal of further increasing employment and of extending the opportunities that come with having a job for all of those in Australia who are at risk of exclusion. But what do we hear from those opposite - what do we hear from the policy-free zone? Where are their solutions, where is the innovation, where is the policy, where are their ideas, how are they going to tackle making sure that the excluded go into employment? Well, again, we are met by a policy-free zone, and the only thing that they come back to when talking about jobs is of course the return to Work Choices - the old Work Choices which they seem unable to break -                      We do see the opposition come to life at the mere mention of Work Choices. But let us make it very clear: the way that we are returning those who have been excluded to employment is not through slashing penalty rates, it is not through slashing the wages and conditions of Australian workers and it is not through allowing unfair dismissal; it is through support, it is through resourcing and it is through new opportunities.                 Australia's unemployment rate now stands as one of the lowest in the industrialised world, in stark contrast to that of all of our peers. We are proud of these measures in this government. We are pursuing these measures so that more Australians can enjoy the benefits of work and we are determined to continue doing so.

 I thank the member for his question. The World Trade Organisation ruled in November last year that New Zealand apples be allowed into Australia subject to scientifically based conditions. The government accepted that ruling in compliance with Australia's obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Since that time, Biosecurity Australia, at arm's length from government, has been working on those scientifically based conditions. This has involved extensive consultation with stakeholders, from November last year until yesterday. Yesterday the director of quarantine announced the scientific conditions established as a result of those independent scientifically based processes. That does pave the way for the importation of apples from New Zealand. This morning, however, despite my urgings yesterday in this parliament, the shadow agriculture minister went ahead and announced that he will be proceeding with a bill that will overturn yesterday's decision.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I hear, 'Hear, hear!' coming from members of the National Party. The opposition's bill is in direct contravention of the World Trade Organisation's ruling and would, therefore, put at risk Australia's agricultural exports by putting us in breach of the world trading rules. This would be the first time in Australia's history that Australia refused to accept a decision of the World Trade Organisation. Passage of the opposition's bill would open up Australian farmers to retaliation by New Zealand, which could legally apply tariffs of up to 100 per cent on Australian agricultural exports to New Zealand.                 Of course, in seeking to score some base political points against the government, the coalition is signalling its willingness to sacrifice the livelihoods of Australian farmers. The National Party should be ashamed of itself. Let us hear from an authority on this. Former Prime Minister John Howard once observed, when he was being urged to reject a World Trade Organisation ruling, that 'Australia would be murdered in a trade war'. Those are not my words; those are the words of former Prime Minister John Howard: 'Australia would be murdered in a trade war.' He pointed out that we export four times as much agricultural produce as we import and that we could suffer four times as much damage in retaliation.                 The present opposition leader has not prevailed over the shadow minister from the National Party because he has refused to show any leadership whatsoever. He is doing what he always does, and that is seeking opportunistically to harvest a few votes and to sacrifice the living standards and the livelihoods of innocent Australian farmers, who could be caught in the crossfire between Australia and New Zealand in a trade war. The opposition leader is willing to trash the so-called free trade credentials of the previous Prime Minister and of the Liberal Party. Why? Because he thinks there might be a few votes in it.                  What about the farmers who would get caught in the crossfire? Why is the National Party not concerned about them? Why is the opposition leader so gutless that we have the National Party tail wagging the coalition dog? Show a bit of leadership. That is what you need to do. Show a little bit of leadership for once in your life. Resist the opportunism for which you are famous. You are cutting the throats of Australian farmers by not wanting to upset the shadow agriculture minister, because we know that the National Party determines the policies of the Liberal Party and that One Nation advises you on your xenophobic, disgusting and appalling policies -

  On the Leader of the Opposition's question, like so many questions before, first and foremost, I think we should be very, very clear that the announcement by BlueScope today, which would be received as very, very difficult news for the workforce of BlueScope, with 1,000 jobs to go, 800 in the Illawarra and 200 in Hastings, that that very tough news for those families is not related to the government's policy of putting a price on carbon. I refer the House to the statement that BlueScope Steel made to the Australian Stock Exchange where it said:                 The economic conditions for export steel-making from Australia appear unlikely to become favourable in the foreseeable future, and our continued exposure to this marker is clearly unsustainable. Our decision is a direct response to the economic factors affecting our business and is not related to the Federal Government's proposed carbon tax.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I go to some trouble to make that point about BlueScope Steel because, as I understand it, some of these things are already being misrepresented and I believe that it is quite wrong to misrepresent to around 1,000 working people and their families the reason that their jobs are under threat. I want to be absolutely clear before this parliament, and I think that every member of this parliament has got an obligation to be absolutely clear with individuals in the community, that this is not a decision related to the government's plans to put a price on carbon.                 On the government's plan to put a price on carbon, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that both the government and the opposition are committed to a minus-five per cent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020. The question therefore presents that if you are going to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, do you start soon and do it in the easiest possible way or do you start late with dramatic dislocation to the economy? Well, I am for starting soon. The Leader of the Opposition is for starting late, with dramatic dislocation. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition's plan would be good for Australian industries and businesses because of that dramatic dislocation.                 Number 2, the question that presents is: do you do it in the most efficient and cheapest possible way, or do you do it in the most costly and cumbersome way? I am for doing it in the cheapest possible way. The Leader of the Opposition is for doing it in the most costly and cumbersome way. And of course in assessing that putting a price on carbon is the cheapest possible way to do it, we have relied on the advice of economists. I know that that is discounted by members opposite, but I would refer them, for example, if they are looking for sources of economic advice, to the words of the IMF where they have said:                 We support the proposed introduction of a carbon price as part of a transition to a permits trading system to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.                 They went on to say in a facts sheet:                 Broad based taxes on greenhouse gas emissions are the most natural policy instrument as they exploit all possible behavioural responses for reducing emissions throughout the economy _                 The shared minus five per cent target: we want to do it in the most efficient way. We want to do it in the way that is therefore best for Australian industries, businesses and employment. It is the Leader of the Opposition that is committed to a scheme of dislocation and job losses.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. Today we are seeing more extraordinary events in Libya. We have lived through a great number in the Arab spring but there are more extraordinary events on our TV screens as the story of the Arab spring continues to unfold.                 Today we have seen rebel forces reach Tripoli. They have reached Green Square. They are in the heart of the capital. There appears to be little resistance in the square itself. We have seen scenes of celebration. But we do not know the full story of what has unfolded in Tripoli. We do not know with certainty where Gaddafi is. We do not know what resistance remains. There may be more fighting ahead. But it does appear that another undemocratic regime is falling.                 Colonel Gaddafi, with his family, has ruled Libya with an iron grip since 1969. As has been the subject of discussion in this parliament, he brutally took up arms against his own people earlier this year. He plunged his country into what has been a bloody civil war. Some of the things that we have seen in that civil war have rightly caused horror and outrage around the world.                 Under a UN Security Council mandate, the international community acted to protect civilians from Gaddafi. His regime appears to be ending. Today is a day of relief and celebration in Libya. What that means though is tomorrow a lot of hard work begins. Australia wants for Libya a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future. We know it is in reach but it is not certain. Australia has recognised the National Transitional Council as the legitimate governing authority in Libya. We were one of the first countries to call for the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone. We have been at the forefront of international humanitarian assistance and in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.                 Along with other members of the international community, we stand ready to support the work that will now be necessary in Libya: the work that will be necessary to end all violence; the work that will be necessary to bring Libya to a state of order; the work that will be necessary to develop a tolerant, inclusive, democratic society; and the work that will be necessary to breathe life back into Libya's battered economy. The work will be difficult and the path ahead is uncertain, but I am sure each of us has been very joyful to see the scenes of celebration today.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Jobs have been the No. 1 priority of this government from day one. When it comes to carbon pricing, we are concerned about the jobs of the future in a first-class economy driven by renewable energy.                     There are a lot of things that offend me about the opposition but one of the things that really offends me is how excited they get at job losses because they think there is some political credit in them for them. We on this side of the House understand the challenges, short-term and long-term, of creating a strong economy. We understand the need to maximise the opportunities that come from the mining boom. We understand the need for jobs of the future, particularly in renewable energy. Those opposite have no credit when it comes to jobs.                 We on this side of the House moved to protect our economy at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession. What did those opposite do? They voted against jobs in this House. When it comes to a record on jobs, we on this side of the House support jobs and we support Australian families - the 750,000 jobs that have been created while this government has been in power, the nearly 200,000 jobs that have been created. Today is a really tough day down in the Illawarra and a really tough day down in Western Port. We on this side of the House understand the gravity and the importance of this situation. We understand why it is important to put in place a range of economic policies which support our economy and future job growth. That lay at the very centre of the budget we brought down in May. We said then that we had a patchwork economy which would be impacted on by a variety of factors, and one of those is the Australian dollar. That has made life very difficult indeed for Australia's trade exposed industries. We understand that and that is why we have moved to put in place a range of policies to broaden and strengthen our economy to ensure everybody in our country, not just those in the fast lane, gets the benefit of a strong economy. That is why we on this side of the House have put in place a resource rent tax so we can give tax cuts to small business and corporate Australia more generally. That measure is opposed by those on the opposite side of the House.                  We understand the importance of jobs. We understand the importance of spreading the benefits of the mining boom, we understand the importance of investing in skills and infrastructure and we understand the importance of bringing our budgets back to surplus in a responsible way, not $70 billion worth of mindless cuts from those opposite to make up for all of the thought bubbles of the Leader of the Opposition because he cannot run a fiscal policy. We on this side of the House understand the importance of fiscal policy. We understand the importance of investing in infrastructure. We understand the advantage of investing in skills. We understand productivity through investment in the NBN. But those on that side of the House just want to play cheap politics with the lives of people. We understand that we have to respond and assist those workers. We understand we need to be with those workers who are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. To do that, you have to have responsible economic policies. You cannot have a reckless Leader of the Opposition going around with thought bubbles.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I know that he and the member for Cunningham will be working with their local community as it deals with the blow that they have had today. This is very difficult news for the people of the Illawarra. It is also very difficult news for people in Hastings. We understand the patchwork of pressures that are on our economy and we have been discussing with the Australian community for a considerable period of time now the fact that our nation is in the grips of an economic transition.                 We are seeing a global transition of economic weight from west to east. That is good for Australia, because it means that we are here in the part of the world that is growing and will continue to grow strongly and where the history of this century will be written. We understand too that our economy is going through a transition which comes from record terms of trade and strong demand for our resources. That means that our Australian dollar has been and will continue to be high. That puts pressure on export oriented industries like manufacturing, like tourism and like international education. We also understand that we need to see our economy transition to a clean energy future, and the most efficient way of doing that is to put a price on carbon.                 Understanding those patchwork pressures on our economy, we have seen today's announcement from BlueScope. We understand that this requires the government to respond in a series of ways. We are responding directly and nationally with BlueScope through our Steel Transformation Plan. We intend to respond to the needs of the regions involved with a plan to directly invest in economic diversification and jobs - $30 million will be available, $20 million from the federal government, $5 million from the government of New South Wales and $5 million from BlueScope itself. We are also making available $10 million in direct services and support for working people. We will also be investing in jobs in Hastings. We want to make sure that the working people who are caught up in this decision get their full entitlements, and we welcome the fact that BlueScope has said they will be paid their full entitlements. They will get the assistance that they need in skilling, training and support to get a new job. The regions affected will also get support for economic diversification.                 I believe that Australia will continue to be a nation that manufactures products that the world will want to buy. As a government, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. Whether through the new car plan, through our powering ideas agenda or through the work we have done on procurement and supplier advocates, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. I believe that we will continue to be a nation that makes things and has the benefit of high value added jobs and high wage jobs. Of course, that will mean that we will need to work with the manufacturing industry and those parts of the country that are particularly reliant on manufacturing. We will be working directly with the members for Throsby and Cunningham as we work our way through these job losses at BlueScope and the consequences for the individuals and for the community.

  I certainly believe now is the time to be working with manufacturing to secure its future. I certainly believe that means that the government does need to continue to roll out its programs and plans like the new car plan and I certainly believe that that requires us to work with manufacturing as we transition to a clean energy economy. In the carbon pricing package that we have announced there are allocations of around a billion dollars to work with manufacturing because we want to see them make that transition to a clean energy future.                  Now is not the time to be cutting back the programs that support manufacturing, as the Leader of the Opposition has committed to do. Now is certainly not the time to be doing that. Now is not the time to go about cutting carbon pollution in the most costly, least efficient way possible. The Leader of the Opposition's plans for a $1,300 per family slug and no industry assistance as industries transition would be dreadful for manufacturing. Of course, if he were ever elected as Prime Minister, before he got there he would be taking a direct slug of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars out of the support that we provide to manufacturing. That is the plan in writing and circulated in the community of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister. It is a dreadful thing to do to manufacturing, given the pressures on it at the present time.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his commitment to representing constituents on the Pacific Highway up the New South Wales coast. He would be aware that we have committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway, more than any government has ever committed to any road in Australia's history over such a period of time.                 The fact is that work is proceeding apace. The Ballina bypass will be open early. It will be open by Christmas, six months ahead of schedule and on budget. Work has also commenced on the longest bridge ever constructed in Australia, which is a part of the Kempsey bypass. The builders for the Devils Pulpit upgrade have been selected and work will commence by the end of the year. The building contract for Tintenbar to Ewingsdale in the electorate of Page was also awarded in the last fortnight. Work is forging ahead on the Bulahdelah bypass, the Banora Point upgrade and the Sapphire to Woolgoolga duplication. All up, today there are more than a thousand Australians at work upgrading the Pacific Highway. Our last budget saw an additional billion dollars injected into the Pacific Highway so we could meet that objective. I was there with the member for Lyne and the member for Page with the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, following our commitment announcement in May, and I was encouraged by the very direct commitment that the Deputy Premier gave on behalf of the New South Wales government to meet our shared objective on the full duplication of the highway. Just last month he said the date 'remained plausible as long as both governments commit to it'.                 There is no doubt this is a big challenge. All of the planning work had not been completed, which is why we needed to put that extra funding into the budget. I look forward to the New South Wales government on 6 September stumping up its share of the money in the $750 million that it has committed. New South Wales Minister for Roads Duncan Gay has 'staked his reputation on securing a major funding boost for the Pacific Highway in this year's state budget'. He said:                 My first target and task is to fulfil that commitment in this year's budget _ unless we can keep with them -                  the federal government -                  we are falling out of the game.                 This is a vital upgrade. That is why we have contributed $4.1 billion, which stands in stark contrast to the $1.3 billion committed over 12 long years by the former government. We have committed more than triple the money in half the time because we are absolutely committed to delivering on this project. I look forward to working with the New South Wales government to meet our shared objective.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for that very important question, and I know she will be working very hard with locals who have been affected by this decision which has been announced today, because this House does understand, I believe, just how significant an announcement this is and what a blow it is to affected workers, their families and their communities. There is no question that this government is committed to a very strong manufacturing sector for our country, and a critical part of a strong manufacturing sector is, of course, a strong steel industry. The steel industry faces a number of challenges: rising input prices, excess global supply, weak domestic demand and, of course, a higher dollar. A higher dollar certainly delivers cheaper prices to many consumers, but it also means that more of our manufacturers are under pressure. Sadly, we are seeing the consequences of that today.                 So the thoughts of everybody, at least on this side of the House, are with all of those workers that are affected today. That is why we will contribute $20 million to a new investment fund to support growth and new jobs in the region. BlueScope and the New South Wales government are also providing $5 million each, totalling $30 million, and we are providing a further $10 million to provide redundant workers with immediate access to intensive support, training and relocation services.                 The government will also allow BlueScope to draw down up to $100 million in advance payments from the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. This just underscores how important this plan is, and for the life of me I simply cannot understand why those opposite are opposing the Steel Transformation Plan. It is just as irresponsible as their plan to rip out $500 million in support for the automobile industry. They simply have no sense of the challenges facing manufacturing industry in this country.                 BlueScope has provided a number of important assurances. The Port Kembla blast furnace and the metal-coating line at Western Port will be able to be reactivated if conditions improve - that is the commitment that has been given - and redundant workers will be paid their full legal entitlements. BlueScope will continue as a significant employer in the region over the life of the Steel Transformation Plan and, importantly, remains committed to steel production in Australia.                 So on this side of the House we understand that, if we want to continue to have a strong manufacturing industry into the future, we do need a long-term reform plan. That is why the government is cutting company tax to 29 per cent, with a head start for small business, and using the revenue from the MRRT - once again, that very significant reform is opposed by those on the other side of the House. It is why we are putting in place major tax concessions for small business - the $6,500 instant asset write-off. Nothing could be more important to the cash flow of a small business than a $6,500 instant asset write-off, which is opposed by those of the other side of the House, for 2.7 million small businesses in our country, many of which are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. It is also why we are committed to a $3 billion skills and training package. What we are on about is putting in place the long-term reforms to strengthen and broaden our economy and to make sure the opportunities of the mining boom are spread right around our economy. We have a plan for the future; sadly, those opposite do not. They have only a plan for picking fault, scoring points and talking down our economy. That is the only plan they have.

  Questions of personal explanations are for the individual parliamentarians involved. No. 2: yes, I do have full confidence in the member for Dobell. No. 3: the situation continues to be as it has been for some time. Fair Work Australia has an investigation in train, and we should await the outcomes of that investigation. I also think the standards that are asked to be applied to one side of the parliament should be applied to both sides of the parliament. Whilst I am on my feet, I say to the opposition that I cannot believe that they would seek to draw into their grubby politics the question of 1,000 workers losing their jobs.

  What I have here is the red tape that existed in the heavy vehicle industry for truckies under the previous government.                     Last Friday COAG met here in Canberra, and the Prime Minister got agreement from each of the premiers and territory leaders for national transport regulators. National transport regulators are absolutely vital in cutting this red tape that holds back the Australian economy and that causes safety issues because of the varying regulations that are there in the economy. What I have here are real books - these are real books that exist in the cabs of D&amp;S Haulage Pty Ltd. This is a company based in Tumby Bay in South Australia. The President, Mr David Smith, who I have met with a number of times, is the immediate past president of the Australian Livestock Transporters Association. These four folders are the actual paperwork, with the different state and territory regulations and approvals, that is in the cab of every one of the 16 trucks that he owns.                 We will, as a result of last Friday's efforts - with a $30 billion benefit to the national economy over 20 years - get rid of all of it, as a result of the reform. This is real, practical change as a result of this government's commitment to microeconomic reform and improving productivity. No more will they have to deal with different weight regulations. No more will they have to deal with the current situation whereby a B-double in Queensland can have 66 cattle on it, when they get to the New South Wales border they are only allowed 60 cattle. So what do they do? Offload the six cattle at the border; just like they have different weight provisions; just like they have different fatigue laws. These are the real issues that this government is dealing with, which is why the Australian trucking industry, the Livestock Transporters Association and the Australian Logistics Council have all been working with this government to achieve this real change.                 Meanwhile, those opposite have been working with a different organisation, of Mick Pattel, who organised, of course, the convoy of no consequence outside -                      where a couple of hundred people gathered, with no support from the mainstream organisations -                      the people who believe in one world government, the people who believe in a conspiracy, along with the Leader of the Opposition.                     The Trots have bigger demos outside my electorate office once a week. The fact of the matter is this: we are getting on with working with the mainstream organisations, including the Australian Trucking Association, for real reform, real change, making a real difference to people's lives and making a real difference to the economy.

  To the Leader of the National Party, I would refer him to a number of state based schemes which apply methodologies already. So this is not something newly invented; this is something that has happened under various other schemes. Indeed, when I have been to talk to people in the landfill industry, one of the questions they raise with me is the question of transition from some of the state based schemes that they are involved in.                 Can I say to the Leader of the National Party, who asked the question too, this is really taking us back, so it is kind of groundhog day again, to the Leader of the Opposition's contention that apparently you cannot calculate -                      I would say to the Leader of the Opposition abuse is not a substitute for reason and he may want to go to some of the landfill sites where, for example, today they are collecting these emissions and today they are using those emissions to generate electricity for nearby households. In answer to the Leader of the National Party's question, I say that this is taking us back again to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition that apparently you cannot measure or track carbon pollution. If he really believes that, how can he support a minus five per cent target? How can he? This is him doing or saying anything. In front of people he believes are supporters of climate change denial he will get the kind of questions we have just had asked today. In front of audiences like those when he is blogging on Mamamia he will say he is in support of a minus five per cent target. But if the Leader of the Opposition genuinely believes that it is impossible to track carbon pollution he should get to the dispatch box and say he does not support a minus five per cent target. If he does support a minus five per cent target he should stop these stupid questions being asked.

   I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her continued strong advocacy for a region of Australia which is a great trading region whose prosperity depends very much on our capacity to maintain our export markets. Australia is a founding member of the global trading system, which has well established rules for the conduct of trade between member nations. Members are bound to comply with those rules. If they do not, other member countries can take retaliatory action against them. There are now 153 members of the World Trade Organization and more are trying to join up each year - that is, people want to be inside the World Trade Organization: inside those rules not outside. Yet the opposition leader would recklessly breach world trading rules and tear up trade agreements with our regional trading partners.                  The shadow agriculture minister has introduced into parliament a bill on New Zealand apples that would violate the world trading rules and expose innocent farmers, including those in Capricornia, to retaliation. The coalition, in addition, is supporting a private member's bill on palm oil labelling, which risks provoking a trade war with Malaysia and Indonesia. Indeed, the opposition leader's antitrade agenda extends to his opposition to international trading in carbon permits.                 The opposition leader has indicated his total opposition to trading in carbon permits. In doing so he shares the view of the one-world government conspiracy theorists that one tonne of carbon dioxide weighs -                    The members for Mayo and Wakefield then left the chamber.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I was making the point that the opposition leader's opposition to international trade extends to trading internationally in carbon permits, because in fact he believes, almost uniquely within this parliament - the member for Ryan probably agrees with him - that one tonne of carbon weighs, wait for it, nothing. This is the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. He says:                 See, one of the things that people haven't quite twigged to is that carbon dioxide is invisible, it's weightless and it's odourless. How are we going to police these emissions_                 It is weightless, yet he has promised to cut emissions of a gas, that he describes as weightless, by 140 million tonnes. A 140 million tonnes of weightless gas! He is going to be going pretty hard to do that, isn't he? He is going to cut emissions by 140 million tonnes of weightless gas! I do not always agree with the member for Wentworth but I agree with this statement of his. He said:                 Carbon dioxide does obviously have a weight, and if you drop a large lump of dry ice on your foot, you'll find that out very quickly.                 He is right. I think he would like to drop a large tonne of dry ice somewhere else - perhaps on the opposition leader's head.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The opposition leader's antitrade policy has been topped off with the opposition associating itself with the failed 'convoy of no confidence' - or was it the 'convoy of no consequence'?                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                       Dr EMERSON:                     If there is anyone in whom we should lack confidence it is the opposition leader, a recklessly, relentlessly negative opposition leader who has dug for himself a $70 billion budget black hole, whose antitrade policies are putting at risk the livelihoods of ordinary working Australians. Undeterred by that relentlessness we will press ahead in implementing the necessary economic reforms to create more jobs and more security in this country.

  I thank the member for his question. I think the member had missed something absolutely pivotal and central to the scheme, which is that the entities paying the carbon price are the biggest polluters. So where the price signal is working, it is working as a price signal to the biggest polluters to innovate and to change the way that they conduct business.                  This is exactly the same mechanism that the John Howard emissions trading scheme had at its heart, which was supported by the Leader of the Opposition and all of the members of the front bench who were ministers at the time. So at the moment these businesses that generate carbon pollution can put any amount of carbon pollution into the atmosphere for no cost. It does not matter if next year you put more up into the atmosphere than this year because it is at no cost. Why would you bother innovating to reduce the amount of carbon pollution? You do not face any costs. So the way in which carbon pricing will work -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I am responding directly to the question. I was asked about price signals and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and we are now seeing something that perhaps explains the grand confusion about these questions amongst some members of the opposition. The price is paid by the biggest polluters. Of course, as rational business people, they will seek to reduce that price and as they seek to reduce that price they will innovate and change the way that they do business and cut the amount of carbon pollution they generate. If you move amongst the Australian business community, and I know the member who asked the question does that, you will meet and be able to have discussions with business people who can talk to you about their innovation plans to reduce carbon pollution because they know that carbon pricing is coming and will start on 1 July next year.                 What the member is also referring to is that there is some flowthrough from carbon pricing into the prices of things that people buy and that impact - the Leader of the Opposition in his scare campaign has said that impact is 'astronomical' - is 0.7 per cent of CPI and households are being assisted so that around four million households will come out better off and around six million households will be fully compensated.                 As prices change in shops, yes, you will see an effect where goods that have less carbon pollution imbedded in them will be relatively cheaper, but we want those price signals to be true price signals not the results of price gouging, which is why, yes, we will have very strong fines and penalties for anybody who goes through and price gouges - that is, they adjust a price in a way that is disproportionate and not as a result of carbon pricing and then claim to the consumer that the price has only been changed because of carbon pricing.                 To come back to the reasons behind this question, if the member has fundamentally misunderstood the scheme I would suggest to him that he look at it again. I know he is on the public record as saying:                 When it comes to economic issues, my instinct is for open markets, free competition _                 If that is right, he should be endorsing an emissions trading scheme and not the red tape regulation and burdens that the Leader of the Opposition would use to smash Australian businesses and to smash Australian jobs. The other thing I would suggest is that he endorse the government's plan to make sure there that there is no price gouging.                     I am happy to keep explaining. What I would like to see is some point where the Leader of the Opposition explains his plan, given no economist in the nation endorses it.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I appreciate that members on this side of the House are interested in how our health reforms are delivering. Unfortunately, it is two years since I have had a question from the shadow minister on health reform and this is despite the historic delivery that our government has been able to achieve through health reform. Seventy thousand extra elective surgeries and not a question from those opposite. An increase of 50 per cent in funding for hospitals and not a question from those opposite. The MyHospitals website and not a question from those opposite. Local hospital networks up and running in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT and now a long-term reform package to increase funding transparency, efficiency and beds.                 Take the member for Corangamite's electorate as an example. Our health reform means that there are going to be five palliative care beds at Colac hospital and eight new subacute beds at Geelong Hospital. Our GP superclinic on the Bellarine Peninsula has been running for nearly one year, providing services and training staff in partnership with Deakin University. Medicare Locals are up and running in 19 communities, including the electorates of Corangamite and Corio. There is a new breast-care nurse working in the region and we have put nurse practitioners and midwife consultations onto the MBS for the first time as well as specialist telehealth consultations which can be accessed by all of rural and regional Australia if their specialist is in the city and not accessible to them. Throughout all of these reforms that are being delivered, not just in the electorate of Corangamite but across the country, we have not had one question on health reform from the opposition. For two years, the shadow minister has not thought it worthwhile to ask us one question. You have to ask: why is this? Is it because the Leader of the Opposition is so embarrassed about his history in this area that they just do not want to ask a question? Is it because the member for Dickson actually has not thought of a question that can be asked? Or perhaps he has no policies at all that he can raise with us to ask whether we would pursue them as part of our health reforms.                 Let me also update the House on how some of our other health reforms are delivering benefits to the community. Our preventative health initiatives have seen drops in consumption of both alcopops and cigarettes. One of our most recent investments is making a real difference - that is, our GP after-hours phone line. I can now announce to the House that, just since 1 July this year, 20,000 services have been provided by that GP after-hours service. We have increased the number of GPs that can be trained across the country. The Leader of the Opposition had a cap of 600 GPs to be trained every year; since his time as health minister, we have another 475 extra GPs in training and we are going to increase that to 1,200. Again, in the member for Corangamite's electorate, there are six new trainees as GPs. This story is told across the country, whether you go to the electorates of our regional Independents, the electorates of the backbench on the other side or the electorates that we represent. Health reform is delivering to the community, and those opposite have not asked a question about it.

  Member for Dunkley, the modelling that has been produced is reliable and we stand by the Treasury modelling -                      I know that there have been debates about modelling in recent days, and the -                      I know that there have been some issues about modelling raised in the Victorian newspapers which may have brought this question to the member's mind. What I can say to the member is that the modelling projects that the economy of Victoria will grow by 30 per cent to 2020 alone and by 162 per cent by 2050. These are not some of the results that people have recently seen in their newspapers.                     The Treasury modelling is accurate in showing the macroeconomic effects of carbon pricing, and I am referring him to those macroeconomic effects. I understand that there have been debates started about modelling, including modelling at a subregional level. Modelling at a subregional level is not reliable, and Treasury makes that point very strongly indeed. So I say to the member for Dunkley, who may, like other members of the Victorian community, have seen some misleading results in their newspapers, that we stand by, and people should rely on, the Treasury modelling.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He, like so many on this side of the House, understands the importance of encouraging the regions to be their best and the key role that governments play in enabling them to do that. It is essential that we secure the future of the regions because, if we get that done properly, that also secures the future of the nation. That is why we have taken the conscious step of reinvigorating the commitment we make to the regions in terms of not just the structures that we have encouraged but also the resources that enable them to undertake their activities.                 The patchwork nature of this economy has again already been indicated in this chamber today. The regions are the patches, and the reality is that those regions know best how to make their particular patch work better. The interesting message that has come from all of the regions that I and others have had the opportunity to visit is that they get the fact that it is important to diversify their economic base, because it is the regions that have diversified their economic base that are doing best in terms of the 750,000 additional jobs that this government has created. What we are saying is that the lesson that other regions have to learn is to diversify their base. Why? Because we are projecting another 1.6 million jobs by the year 2020, and it is up to the regions to determine how much of that action they get - their slice of that increase in jobs. That is why it is important that government programs are there to assist. That is why there are a package of measures in the budget to help the economy in transition, to invest in skills, to invest in infrastructure and to invest in innovation. That is why, in the cleaner energy package, there are a range of measures that help economies make the transition to a cleaner energy future. I was also asked by the honourable member what obstacles may stand in the way of this. I will tell you what the obstacle would be: electing a government that is built around negativity and fear. The Leader of the Opposition, in talking about the Latrobe Valley, has been saying that they are going to be finished. We know that when the Kennett government were in and privatised the electricity industry, they did it without any industry support. Now, when we put forward our industry support measures, the Baillieu government wants to ignore that in its modelling. The Leader of the Opposition went to Whyalla and said that they would be wiped off the face of the earth because of the clean energy future, when we said that 1,300 more jobs would be created.                 I have been to the Illawarra region - the area that is being talked of today - on a number of occasions with the members concerned. I know that the people of that region are committed to diversifying their economic base. As important as the steel sector is to them, they know that they cannot have an industry so narrowly based that their economy is focused around it alone, and they have welcomed the initiatives that this government has put in place to assist them make their economy in transition.                 We will continue to support these regions in their work. They know where their future lies. They know their strengths. They have identified the hurdles and they want to work with a government that is going to help them overcome those barriers. We know that if the opposition were to get into government they would cut those programs with their $70 billion black hole.

  I thank the member for his question. First and foremost, on construction costs: construction predominantly relies on things that have the maximum assistance rate - things like cement, for example. So I would refer the member to that. There have been some very exaggerated figures in the public domain about impacts on construction costs. Should the member have read any of those figures and be inclined to believe them, I would point the member to the fact that the inputs for construction tend to be things that have the maximum rates of assistance.                 Secondly, people with disabilities will see an increase in their disability support pension. They are amongst the pensioner households who will, on average, come out $210 in front when you take into account all of the effects of carbon pricing. Thirdly, in terms of the way in which the government works, for example, with state governments on disability services, payments under those intergovernmental agreements are indexed. Normally an element of that indexation is what has happened in CPI movements. It is weighed in the index and -                      I am being reminded that the current indexation for the national disability agreement is three times the indexation paid under the former government. But my point in relation to carbon pricing is that, as the 0.7 per cent comes into the CPI, the CPI tends to be an input for indexation of government payments. So there is an increase there that flows as a result of the CPI arrangements.                 What I would also say to the member is that, if he has a particular interest in disabilities, the big debate in disability services today is on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I was very pleased to see national agreement to that by all leaders on Friday last week, and we look forward to continuing to develop that scheme - a national disability insurance scheme - because we do not want to see Australians with disabilities left behind.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. Last week the OECD released a very important report on education, OECD reviews of evaluation and assessment in education:Australia, and unambiguously gave this government a big tick on education reform. I want to quote briefly from what the OECD review team said. They said, 'The overall evaluation and assessment framework appears as highly sophisticated and well conceptualised.' They went on to say that 'particularly positive' features include a focus on student outcomes, a coherent system of assessments for learning, a structure to integrate accountability and improvement, and the commitment to transparency. We could not have put it any better if we had tried. My School, national testing and the Australian curriculum got a huge vote of confidence by the OECD looking at national progress on education and the Gillard government's reforms in that area.                 The review also pointed towards further improvement, and there it identified the very policies that we took to the last election and are now delivering - a national performance management system for teachers, rewarding our best teachers, identifying our best schools, providing rewards for school improvements, and empowering local schools by allowing them to make decisions about what works best in their community.                 The fact is that this government is committed to making every school a great school. The architecture is in place and the next tranche of reforms will take the reform even further. Let us remember the context: significant improvement of the facilities of schools in the country through the Building the Education Revolution, providing some $2.5 billion to our nation's schools to lift the performance of students who are falling behind and to improve teacher quality. This government is spending over $65 billion on education - nearly twice what was spent previously by the coalition. Unfortunately, every time the shadow cabinet sits down to look at funding cuts education is on the chopping block. The fact is that Mr Abbott and the coalition are already on the record as committing to some $2.8 billion out of education. While the shadow minister for education trails his coat on foreign policy and, it seems, writes very literate essays about China, at the same time when they meet in the shadow cabinet all they are doing is contemplating cuts in education. He admitted on Meet the Press recently that education would not be spared from the $70 billion that the opposition is contemplating cutting from our budget.                 Whether it is $5 billion or $10 billion or $15 billion - and $15 billion, incidentally, is a quarter of our education budget - the fact is that these reforms are absolutely essential to the nation's prosperity and progress. But the sorts of cuts that the opposition has in place mean that NAPLAN is gone, My School is gone, the Australian curriculum is gone, teaching standards are gone and remaining trades training centres are gone. And the policies identified by the OECD that this government wants to put in place - performance management systems for teachers, local school empowerment and digital technology opportunities; all of those things - are gone under an opposition that does not know how important education is for the future of this country.                 We will continue to deliver those education reforms and to make every school a great school.

  I thank the member for his question. I am not sure whether anybody has been holding up their number 10 sign, but I think that should have got a 10 for the most creative question of the day.                 I am afraid that I could not watch the television show that he refers to last night. I am sure I would have enjoyed it, but I did not have an opportunity to watch it. What I can say to him about construction costs is what I said to the earlier member: actually, there are some very inflated estimates floating around about impacts on construction costs because the things that are predominantly used in construction are the things with the maximum assistance rate.                 What I would say to him about confidence questions is that, yes, there are a series of things that are impacting on consumer confidence. We have had the opportunity today to talk in question time about the patchwork pressures on our economy. I think that that is showing on consumer confidence. I think the overhang from the global financial crisis is showing. People are alive to risks around the world, and their TV screens over the last few weeks have presented to them images of risk from the US, with the political gridlock around fiscal consolidation, and then, of course, from Europe with some of its sovereign debt problems.                 I believe, too, that there has been an impact on consumer confidence as people have seen an outworking of the global financial crisis with reductions in their superannuation earnings. Some people have become concerned about their house prices; not necessarily that they have gone backwards but that the rate of growth that they would have liked to have seen in their house price is not going to be as strong as they would initially have envisaged.                 There are a lot of pressures on people, but I would say to the member that I hope he is out in his local community explaining to people that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. I hope he takes the opportunity, too, when he is in party room meetings with the Leader of the Opposition, to explain that it is not in the interests of his constituents for the Leader of the Opposition to misrepresent the impacts of carbon pricing day after day and to talk the Australian economy down.

  I would like to thank the member for La Trobe for her question because we on this side of the House know that people being able to retire, and not to retire poor, is very important.                 On this side of the House we believe in the value of increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. Twelve per cent is good for individuals; it means that they do not have to retire poor. Twelve per cent is good for taxpayers because it will relieve pressure on the age pension in the next 20 and 30 years. In fact, 12 per cent is good for the whole nation. We are the fourth largest capital funds under management market in the world. There is not a lot that Australia is fourth in the world at, but having a large savings pool is one of those accomplishments.                 The value of having those sorts of savings under management in Australia is that it helps to decrease our cost of capital and it means that we have resources here which are the envy of the rest of the world in terms of our savings. But in fact, when we talk about those who benefit, something like eight million Australians will directly benefit from the increase from nine to 12 per cent. That is the number of Australians who do not currently receive 12 per cent superannuation: eight million people.                 The member for La Trobe may be interested to know that in her seat, based on 2007-08 tax returns, something like 53,600 people would be better off with this policy. The opposition leader may be interested in a number: in the seat of Warringah something like 55,000 of his voters currently get less than 12 per cent. The member for Wide Bay, too, may be interested that 37,000 voters in his electorate currently do not get 12 per cent superannuation. We all know that life expectancy is increasing and we all know that the garden variety nine per cent super is not going to be enough for most people to retire on. Thirty in every 100 Australians are getting better than nine per cent but there are 70 in every 100 who are not. It is also important that we increase the life savings for women workers who do not get the same chances on average to accrue the same amount of money that they would at nine per cent.                 On this side of the House we want to take the pressure off future generations. We do not want to be here in 20 years time saying, 'Remember when we had the opportunity to finish the job and lift superannuation from nine to 12 per cent?' After all, when we talk about missed opportunities it was 20 years ago that the Keating government passed legislation to increase super from three to nine per cent. But, of course, there was one group of people who opposed super going from three to nine per cent and we all know who that was. It was the opposition. It has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity on superannuation. It opposed it then and I believe that it opposes increasing compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent now.                 In conclusion it begs one question: how can those opposite, knowing that so many tens of thousands of their voters stand to improve from nine to 12 per cent, receive their defined benefits super or 15.4 per cent superannuation? Got to love the hypocrisy - you take it for yourself but you will not give it to other people. It is not fair and we intend to change that for all Australians rather than the opposition who yet again will be on the wrong side of history.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say the position he refers to is an important position. We have been consulting and working with industry to get the right person to fill it. But even as that work has been happening we have rolled out measures under our Australian procurement statement. If I can take the Leader of the Opposition to those measures, because I think they are important for members of parliament to understand and for local communities, through them, to understand, that was a $50 million package which had, as part of it, buying Australian at home and abroad and to put in advocacy work for Australian suppliers. At its heart it also had procurement plans so that when we engage in procurement that we deal with people who have Australian industry procurement plans and participation plans so that we know that local industry will benefit. In addition, through that policy we have had other measures of ensuring that people in the private sector also have Australian industry participation plans. That has worked to leverage billions of dollars of new investment which has made a difference to Australian suppliers. That work comes on top of the investments that we have made in the new car plan, a plan of more than $5 billion to make sure we continue to be a nation that manufactures automobiles. All of this work comes on top of the other measures taken by Minister Carr through the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and the powering Australian ideas agenda.                 Across the board we have been engaged with manufacturing. We have also been engaged with manufacturing through skills work, which is very important if we are to retain manufacturing in this country. It is certainly my aim that we have the right skill sets. They need to be broad and they need to be deep, which is why we have been investing in skills and I am pleased that that has deepened our skills profile, with more Australians studying at certificate III level and above. It is why we made $3 billion available in the recent budget so that we could better assist with skills and drive a reform agenda.                 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, but I also say that I really do wonder whether he can ask to be taken seriously on this agenda when the stated positions of the opposition on manufacturing are as follows: that they would cut $176 million from the textile, clothing and footwear strategic capability program -                      I was asked on the question of motivation and seriousness about manufacturing and I am making the point that the government will continue to invest and work with manufacturing. As we have done in the past, we will continue in the future.                      I presume the Leader of the Opposition intends to continue with his stated cutbacks: $176 million in textiles, clothing and footwear; $102 million in combining Enterprise Connect and AusIndustry; and $500 million in the Automotive Transformation Scheme, a cutback to which the Leader of the Opposition recently recommitted - something he clearly had not conveyed to his shadow minister because on radio today she was unable to answer questions about whether that half-a-billion dollar cutback was going ahead. It is official opposition policy and I believe Australians will judge them on it.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and her interest in this the most serious of issues - that is, the ability for Australians to have a job, to have the benefits and dignity that come with work. There is nothing more important to this government than making sure Australians have the benefits of work. There is nothing more important to this government than making sure we spread opportunity throughout Australian society - to every part of the nation - to engage in productive work. Getting a job is of course the foundation stone people need so that they and their families can have a good life. It is about getting a job. It is about ensuring that when you have a job you can also get access to the training opportunities you need to get the next job, a better job. It is about the journeys of people from welfare to work at the heart of our recent budget - to help people to make that journey so that they have the benefits and dignity of work. I fundamentally believe that those who can work should work, and that was at the heart of the recent budget.                  When you are as serious as this government is about ensuring people have the benefits of work, then of course you do manage your economic policies so people can see those benefits. That is why we reacted so quickly and so decisively to ensure that we kept Australians working during the global financial crisis. We kept 200,000 Australians working. We were not supported in that. We had to battle it through, but we were determined to battle it through so that Australians had the benefits and dignity of work. It is why too, of course, 20 years ago, even though it was derided by others in politics, we as a political party said that this nation needed to turn its face to Asia and that our trading future would be in this growing region of the world, and so it is. So it is that our trade with Asia today enables us to see turbocharged our resources sector. A quarter of our goods exported alone go to China, fuelling its urbanisation and meaning record terms of trade for our nation. That is a good thing for the resources sector. It is a good thing for jobs in construction. It is a good thing for the jobs that flow as people continue to mine those very valuable commodities that China wants.                 But, of course, at this stage of our economic development we are seeing the Australian dollar pushed up and when the Australian dollar is pushed up it does put pressure on other parts of the Australian economy. We are seeing that in manufacturing. We will be strongly engaged with manufacturing. We see that in tourism. We will be strongly engaged with tourism. We have been and we will continue to be. Of course, we will continue to be engaged with international education, a great export industry for this country.                 We are fiercely proud of the fact that under this government 750,000 jobs have been created. We are fiercely proud of that fact. We are also very conscious that creating jobs for the future means we have to take the right decisions today to modernise and strengthen our economy, the right decisions so we have a clean energy future, the right decisions so that we have the best technology available to us and the right decisions so we are investing in the future of skills so that we can see people in the highest value-adding, and consequently highest paid, activities. We will always focus on making those right decisions so that Australians do have the benefits of work.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is a question about legislation passed under the previous government when the Leader of the Opposition was a supporter of an emissions trading scheme, as were all other members of the Howard cabinet. I am very happy to see the Leader of the Opposition take us back to those times when he believed in pricing carbon, when he believed in putting a cap on carbon and when he believed you could weigh and measure carbon pollution - things he apparently does not believe any longer.                  The website tracks and makes available information under that legislation. The point we have made publicly is that we cannot then mine and use that dataset for other purposes. Of course, businesses who pay the carbon price will know who those businesses are when the system comes into action on 1 July next year. I view it as remarkable indeed that the Leader of the Opposition is in this parliament asking details about the government's carbon pricing plan when he is unable on most days to tell Australians whether he supports a minus five per cent target or not.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have described to the Leader of the Opposition matters associated with that legislation. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that what we continue to see day after day - and clearly today is going to be no different to any other - is misrepresentations from the opposition about the way in which carbon pricing works. They have been out telling people that it would destroy coal; they were wrong about that. They have been out telling people that it would mean astronomical increases in prices; they were wrong about that. They have been out telling people you cannot measure carbon pollution; they were wrong about that. They have been out telling people, depending which audience they are in front of, they are either in favour of or against a minus five per cent target. What they cannot ever tell any Australians is that they have got a policy that will work, because every serious person in this country, every serious economist, considers their policy to be laughable.

  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Jobs have been the No. 1 priority of this government from day one. We understand the importance of employment in terms of peace of mind of a community. That is why we acted during the height of the global financial crisis to support our economy. There is nothing that this government is prouder of than the actions we took at that time to support employment security and, in particular, to support small businesses who were threatened by impacts in the global economy and a catastrophic loss of demand in the global economy. Because of our stimulus, Australia emerged virtually alone as a developed economy that did not go into recession, and what that meant was that hundreds of thousands of Australians stayed in jobs and hundreds of thousands of small businesses kept their doors open. That was a very important advantage for Australia as we go forward, because if you look around the world they did not have that experience. So now Australia has an unemployment rate almost half that in the United States. And if you look elsewhere in the developed world you can see the consequences not just on the economy but on the society from very high levels of unemployment.                 So from our perspective on this side of the House we believe that you have to support jobs, and you have to support jobs through good fiscal policy and intelligent policies, particularly when it comes to investing in reform to make your economy more productive. That is why we are so proud of the fact that 750,000 jobs have been created in the time of this government.                  I noticed before the member for Herbert laughed when the Prime Minister talked about the achievement of 750,000 jobs. This goes to the very core of why we are in parliament: to make a difference. Of course we are now in difficult times in terms of the global economy, but if you look around the world and you compare our unemployment rate to the unemployment rate in other developed economies you can see how well Australia has done. In the United States they have still lost seven million jobs in terms of where they were prior to the global financial crisis. We showed that we were prepared to step in and to put in place effective fiscal policy to prevent a recession, and that has delivered one of the strongest budgets in the Western world. So securing good jobs and responsibly managing our budget goes to the core of what this government wants to do for the future. We have done it in the past, but we are now doing it in a difficult environment, with growth slowing in the US and of course in Europe. What our patchwork economy means is that we have to go back and make sure that we put in place the fundamental reforms that will support employment in the future. What that means is spreading the benefits of the mining boom, giving a tax cut to the 2.7 million small businesses out there, not all of whom are in the fast lane of the mining boom. But, of course, those measures are opposed by those opposite. What it also means is that we must invest in skills, and that is why the $3 billion package was at the heart of the budget we brought down in May. It also means investing in critical infrastructure, most particularly the NBN, and it also means putting in place good fiscal policy and bringing the budget back to surplus. It also means putting a price on carbon so we can drive the jobs of the future in the clean energy economy.                 The Leader of the Opposition was wandering around the place calling for an election. If you are going to call for an election, you have to have a policy. There is a $70 billion hole in the bottom line of those opposite and that is before they get any new policies. That includes a $500 million cut to assistance to the manufacturing industry. We on this side of the House will get on with the job of delivering good policy.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question I would say the member for Dobell has amended his declaration of interests and he has advised me that he has disclosed all relevant matters. I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked this question: there was no way the Leader of the Opposition was going to ask about late declarations, was there?

  I thank the member for New England for that very important question about the value of the dollar, because there is a changing of the guard going on in the global economy and there is a move of economic power from West to East. What that movement of economic power means is that our terms of trade are going to be much higher for much longer than anybody had anticipated only a few short years ago. The strength of the Australian economy compared to other developed economies is one of the reasons our dollar is so strong. The second reason the dollar is so strong is that our terms of trade are at 140-year highs. They certainly will not stay there forever - over time they will come down - but those are the two principal reasons our dollar is strong.                 In this country for the last quarter of a century we have been committed to a market based exchange rate - a freely floating dollar - and we think that is important. We want to see other countries move to a market based exchange rate. That is the point of the discussions at the G20 on the framework for strong and balanced growth. There need to be structural reforms in other developed and developing economies and one of those structural reforms that is required if we are to get rid of global financial imbalances is that those developing countries that do not have a market based exchange rate should get one. The health of the global economy depends on that in the long term.                 When it comes to the strength of the dollar we do, as I said before, believe in a freely floating exchange rate. There is nothing that will change if in the next short period or even medium-term period we were to put in place some sort of sovereign wealth fund, such as the member mentioned before. It would not be a solution to where the dollar is going to go. The most important thing to understand about what we need to do in this economy, given the terms of trade and the pressure that the dollar puts on our exporters, is to make sure that in our economy we are as competitive as we possibly can be to give those businesses that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom the best possible chance to make a profit and to invest. That is why 18 months ago the government put in place a policy of getting a stream of revenue from a resource rent tax so we could give significant tax cuts over time to those companies that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom. That is why we have this commitment: to give a significant tax cut to small businesses, all 2.7 million of them. They are crying out for this sort of assistance.                 The instant asset tax write-off is terribly important to the cash flow of small business. That is why we put that policy in place and that is why we have been committed to bringing the corporate rate of tax down as well. All of these will be funded by revenue from a resource rent tax. In some ways the most important thing of all is building up the superannuation accounts of Australian workers with the revenue stream, as the Assistant Treasurer has been talking about. Effectively, what we have got in those superannuation accounts is eight million sovereign wealth funds. Building up those savings is so important to the future of a capital-hungry country that needs capital to invest. We have in place a process we started 18 months ago when we went out and said to Australians that we were going to go through a resources boom, our terms of trade would be high and would put pressure on the dollar and we needed to make some structural changes in our economy. That is precisely what we are doing, given the circumstances that most people did not fully appreciate 18 months ago when we made these announcements.                 I do not agree with the chairman of the Coal Association at all. He has made so many inaccurate statements in the last couple of weeks that I do not think I would ever believe anything he said.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Of course, the government's plan to cut pollution is centred on a market mechanism, and that will ensure that we fight climate change in the most cost-effective manner. Using a market mechanism is unquestionably the most efficient way of reducing our pollution. That is the conclusion shared by the OECD, the IMF, the World Bank, the Stern report, the work undertaken for the Howard government by Dr Peter Shergold, the Garnaut review and the recent work of the Productivity Commission and every other reputable economist who has considered the issue.                 Treasury modelling concludes that the Australian economy will continue to prosper while we do cut carbon pollution through a market mechanism. Employment is projected to grow strongly with a carbon price, with 1.6 million jobs added to our workforce by 2020. This is supported by modelling that has been released by the Queensland government today that found that Queensland employment will grow strongly, on average, by two per cent per year, with or without a carbon price, with an extra 474,000 jobs created over that period. Of course, since the government has announced its carbon pricing policy, we have seen billions of dollars committed to the coal industry in Queensland and the LNG industry.                 In contrast to the efficiency of a market mechanism, the opposition's 'subsidies for polluters' scheme is inefficient, ineffective and very, very costly. That cost is increased greatly by the opposition's refusal to allow trading in international carbon permits. An emissions trading scheme to achieve the five per cent emissions reduction target through domestic only measures, with no access to international carbon markets, would result in a carbon price at least double the carbon price under the government's scheme. Keep in mind that that costing reflects an emissions trading scheme which is significantly more efficient than the opposition's 'subsidies for polluters' policy. Under that scenario, the 'subsidies for polluters', without access to international permits, will cost the budget $48 billion to 2020, almost five times the stated cost of the coalition policy. That is the equivalent of not paying pensions for a year and a half.                 It would mean that the average Australian household will have to pay an extra $1,300 in taxes. That is a conservative estimate of the cost. The Grattan Institute has had this to say:                 _ if government were to rely on grant-tendering schemes in order to reduce annual emissions by 160 million tonnes, then based on past experience, government would need to announce an abatement purchasing fund of at least $100 billion to meet the 2020 emissions reduction target.                 Whichever way you look at it, the self-declared $70 billion hole -                      I would not be smiling if I were you, Joe, coming up with that. A $70 billion hole is added to significantly by this issue. But he has come up with a novel way of dealing with it. He has decided that carbon pollution is weightless and therefore it will not cost anything to cut it.

  As much as I am tempted to ask what the question was because it has been so long since it was asked, what I do understand is the following: the payment of fees is assessable income of the person who received the payment; beyond that I am not going to comment about the tax affairs of either the member for Dobell, the ALP, any lawyers or anyone else involved in these matters. Furthermore, I invite - I have just forgotten; member for Casey, are you on the front bench? Sorry about that. I was just going to invite the member for Casey -                      I am sorry he didn't back the Leader of the Opposition. I was just going to draw the member for Casey's attention to the answer of the Prime Minister to an earlier question. I see the member Randall's lips moving and as usual, nothing emerging.                     The member for Dickson interjects: I just wish they would give him a question.                     To continue the answer - I assume the question was being asked sincerely - the Prime Minister has indicated that the Register of Interests has been updated. As the Assistant Treasurer, I am not going to comment on the tax office assessments of individuals, and I certainly agree with the Prime Minister on the remainder of her answer. In terms of engagement in any transaction including myself, the answer is no.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question and for his persistent and ongoing interest in good public policy. The Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling - Palm Oil) Bill 2011passed the Senate on 23 June with the support of the coalition. The stated aim of the bill is improvements in consumer labelling but the government already has in place consumer labelling requirements and ongoing processes for considering improvements in consumer labelling. The bill threatens yet again Australian exports, Australian jobs and Australian small businesses. Once again we see an example of the economic recklessness of the Leader of the Opposition and his desire for opportunism over good policy.                 Last night we were able to watch the spectacle of humiliation of the shadow minister for agriculture as the item came up. Where were they? The item on New Zealand apples just disappeared without trace. He completely missed it. There he was a couple of days before saying, 'I'm proceeding with my apples bill.' And what does he do? He is confronted with a humiliating backdown.                     Dr EMERSON:                     You are gobbling up my time, Mr Speaker, but it has allowed me to recover from the devastating blow from the member for Menzies. I will get back to the palm oil bill. Here are the risks associated with the palm oil bill: Malaysia and Indonesia have indicated that they will take a dispute against Australia to the World Trade Organisation if the parliament proceeds with the palm oil bill. If we lost that dispute we would again be exposed to retaliatory action just as we were with the bill that dare not speak its name, the apples bill. It is not just retaliation that we need to worry about. These are the estimates of the adverse impact on Australian businesses of the labelling requirements of the palm oil bill - $150 million.                 Here is the opposition leader who feigns concern about business, we have the shadow minister over here feigning concern about small businesses, but they are happy to apply a $150 million penalty to Australian businesses. Why? Here is the mystery: the coalition members of the Senate committee indicated that they would oppose the bill, that the bill should be opposed.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Coalition members of the Senate committee recommended the bill be opposed. They were going to oppose it until, I am told by coalition MPs, the opposition leader personally intervened and demanded - this is true - that the coalition support this bill in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Do you want to know our position? We are opposing the bill. That is the truth of the matter. Let us hear just briefly what Professor John Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition's former employer, said about him: 'Tony is genuinely innumerate. He has no interest in economics and no feeling for it.' There are 70 billion reasons why this man should never be the Prime Minister of Australia. How many dollars in a $70 billion black hole? There are 70 billion of them! You should never be the Prime Minister of Australia.

  First of all, we are funding it from the steel transformation scheme, so let us get the facts right. We have been in discussions with the steel industry for some time about the structural changes that are occurring in the Australian economy. For the member to suggest that somehow this is all directly linked to carbon pricing is just a continuation of the scare campaign that those opposite have been running on carbon pricing. The fact is we are potentially funding some assistance to BlueScope from the steel transformation scheme - a scheme, I might add, that the Leader of the Opposition says he is opposing. He does not believe in the steel transformation scheme. It is true that we announced it at the time that we announced carbon pricing and it is certainly part of the government's response to a range of structural issues in our economy.                 Putting carbon pricing in place is a fundamental structural reform. It is one of the structural reforms that we as a country require to become much more energy efficient and to make sure that we can get the investment in renewable energy and more efficient energy practices. It is true that for industries like steel this is very important as well. The CEO of BlueScope has made that point - I heard him on the radio this morning making that point. In that sense, both are connected. The steel transformation scheme is connected to a future for the steel industry which is more energy efficient. But I want to repeat what the chairman and the chief executive of BlueScope have said today and yesterday.                     It is a fact that the steel transformation scheme was announced at the same time. There is no doubt about that. I acknowledge that, so I do not know what sort of 'gotcha' moment we are trying to have here. I think they have just completely lost it and gone gaga.                 The fact is that this is a very important scheme that we have put in place, and those opposite should be listening to what the chief executive and chairman of BlueScope are saying. Their decision to cease exporting into those export markets had absolutely nothing to do with carbon pricing and everything to do with the high value of the dollar, which is putting enormous structural pressure on the steel industry. It has a lot more to do with the excess capacity in the steel industry, a lot more to do with very high input prices and a lot more to do with weakened demand for their products. Those were the four factors that were highlighted by the chairman and the chief executive. The two are linked in the sense that having an efficient industry in the future is critical.                 As we go forward, all industries in this economy are going to have to become much more energy efficient. They are going to have to be able to invest in renewable energy and more efficient energy practices, and that is why the two were announced at the same time. All that these questions prove is that those opposite simply have not got a clue about how we put in place the policy settings for a modern economy to drive both investment and jobs for the future.

 I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. As we know, climate change is a global problem, an international problem, and any solution to climate change is going to have to involve coordination and cooperation within the international community. There is, after all, only one atmosphere and a reduction in pollution anywhere in the world has the same environmental benefit. The most practical way that nations can cooperate to tackle climate change is through the development of credible international carbon markets, because through these markets countries can take advantage of the lowest cost pollution cuts that are available. That is what the government's carbon price mechanism will achieve.                  Former Prime Minister John Howard understood this extremely well. The coalition's emissions trading policy that he took to the 2007 election clearly articulated this point. It said:                 The Australian scheme will be designed to maximise the prospect of linkages with other schemes, and with policy-based arrangements such as offsets, where offshore emissions-reducing activities could be counted by Australian firms in determining their net emissions.                 That was coalition policy and an important piece of economic policy because, through international linking of emissions trading schemes, we can establish a common carbon price between our economy and that of our trading partners over time thereby ensuring that carbon pricing does not disadvantage our industries and our businesses.                 The opposition's policy that we should not link with international carbon markets, that we should not allow Australian businesses to purchase carbon credits overseas, would have serious economic consequences. It would more than double the cost of cutting pollution in our own economy to meet emissions reduction targets. This would put Australian businesses at an extreme competitive disadvantage with those overseas. Importantly, economic opportunities for farmers, foresters and other land managers for exporting carbon credits would also be lost. One would imagine that the National Party would have an interest in such an issue. Little wonder that the business community has strongly argued for access to international carbon markets to reduce the cost of emissions reductions. Little wonder that business leaders are rolling their eyes at the economic capacity of the coalition under the member for Warringah's leadership.                 The opposition's policy is economically reckless. It is economic xenophobia. It is sending the signal - which it intends to do, one assumes - that it is somehow dubious to be trading with foreigners. It is typical dog whistle politics from the member for Warringah. It trashes commitments that have existed on both sides of this place to economic liberalisation and open trade. It is a white carbon policy on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. What would be next? Do we stop foreign trade? Do we stop trading in the dollar? Do we ban international trade?                     The humour is in the policy on the other side. The Leader of the Opposition is a significant economic risk. He thinks that a tonne of carbon dioxide is weightless. He thinks cost is nothing. He is not prepared to trade internationally. He is a risk to our economy.

  What an exquisitely timed question from the member for Kooyong.                   The member for Flinders and                    the                    member for Rankin then left the chamber.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I thank the member for Kooyong for his exquisitely timed question, given we are on the issue of international linking and on the fact that the opposition have committed themselves to a scheme that would shut Australia away from the rest of the world and mean that Australian businesses and Australian taxpayers paid more of a price for moving our nation to a clean energy future and that, in particular, would put a burden of $1,300 on every Australian family because they would turn their backs on the rest of the world.                 Throughout the minister for climate change's answer, the Leader of the Opposition was chanting: 'Where are these markets? Where are these markets? Where are these markets?' Let me answer the Leader of the Opposition -                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The member for Kooyong has asked me about modelling; he has asked me about global carbon markets. For the information of the House, global carbon markets in, say, 2005 were worth US$11 billion. In 2010 they were worth US$142 billion. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition may miss economic developments, given his lack of interest, but a global trading market that has gone from $11 billion in 2005 to $142 billion in 2010 I would suggest is very hard for anybody to miss. But apparently the Leader of the Opposition has missed it, the same way as he has missed -                      the fact that you can measure carbon pollution, which is why you can identify a tonne of it.                 On the member for Kooyong's question, he has asked me about the modelling and international action and international markets. The modelling core policy scenario assumes that countries meet the low-end commitments for 2020 they have made at Cancun and at Copenhagen. They are the low-end commitments, I repeat; so that is a conservative approach. From 2016 there is a global market and countries have some form of trade in permits - that is, there will be a mechanism for allowing abatement to be sourced in other countries. And then, of course, after 2020 it is assumed that the global cuts in emissions needed to reach global targets are shared across regions.                 On this question of modelling, as the opposition increasingly turns its back on anything that looks like sensible economic policy let us be very, very clear about the modelling. Hundreds of pages of information have been released. This modelling has been undertaken by exactly the same people who advised the Howard government - for example, they modelled for them the impact of the GST. Putting a slur on the modelling is the same as putting a slur on the scientists and on the economists. It is the kind of thing that the Leader of the Opposition does as he twists and turns to try and maintain his protest campaign, but he is completely unable to articulate a policy alternative, which is why he will go around saying all things to all people and agree with the last person he spoke with.                  Of all the things that have been dealt with in question time today, the government of course is vitally interested in the question of Australian jobs. It still seems to me that a question that should be answered in this parliament is why the Leader of the Opposition is always available for a photo opportunity with a manufacturing worker but when it comes time in this parliament to put his hand up for $300 million of assistance for them he will not do it because he prefers the cheap, petty politics he is known for.                      I was referring to a document which is confidential.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. As a representative of Western Australia, she more than most in this House knows we are an economy in transition yet again. This is not a new challenge to Australia. It is no different to the fundamental restructuring of the Australian economy that occurred in the eighties and nineties. On that occasion we tore down the tariff barriers, embraced globalisation, accepted the need to put in place an active labour market and, in doing so, fronted up to the process of workplace change and the all-important question of productivity.                 On this occasion we are pretty fortunate as a nation - a nation in transition in need of huge restructuring. We have committed $430 billion in new capital investment. We appreciate that in some instances that is putting pressure on other parts of the Australian economy. My responsibility for tourism is a prime example. So is the issue of change confronting the Illawarra and Hastings areas in terms of the pressure on BlueScope and other manufacturing industries. In that context, there is a responsibility on each and every one of us to act in a positive way to embrace change and to assist those communities through this difficult period.                  We should not forget that this is not new to Australia. Ten years ago we would not have thought of Newcastle without a steel industry. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, neither side of politics thought of South Australia without Mitsubishi. The strength of leadership by Premier Rann on that occasion shone a focus on the mining industry, the need for assistance for exploration and the need to chase defence contracts, the responsibility to invest in the services sector, such as the export sectors available in tourism, and education. Those challenges confront places such as Wollongong and Hastings at the moment, and that is why strong leadership is needed to spread the benefits of the current resources boom.                 Yes, there is a need for the Australian community to get a greater share of the record profits being earned by the mining industry at the moment, to enable us to reduce company taxation for the sectors being challenged at the moment, to assist small business in writing off the cost of new capital investment and to invest in infrastructure. The alternative is one of negativity from the opposition and a $70 billion black hole. There is also a responsibility in the private sector to work with government to assist the Australian community in this transition.                  In that context, I acknowledge that I have been working with the Western Australian government, talking to the major resource and energy companies, who are responsible for the $430 million pipeline of investment in this country, to embrace Australian industry to assist them in improving productivity and increasing Australian content. Today, for example, on the $43 billion Gorgon project, there is $14 billion to Australian companies involved in that project. That is a significant change in attitude not only by the Gorgon investors but also by industry at large in Western Australia.                 I also acknowledge the actions of BHP on the South Coast of New South Wales. They will maintain current coal production. They will also work to try to fill those jobs on the South Coast, the 750 coalmining vacancies in Queensland and the 600 vacancies in iron ore in Western Australia. Transition is not easy. It is about strong leadership. It is about time the opposition fronted up to its responsibilities. We must embrace this change and turn it to the benefit of all Australians, not to a select number of Australian companies.

  Whether the question is in order or not I will answer it. To the member who asked the question: China is undertaking actions to reduce the emissions intensity of its economy. Before the Leader of the Opposition and his friends start braying about this let us remember that they too are committed to reducing carbon pollution in this country by minus five per cent by 2020 so, like the government, they have committed to a carbon pollution reduction target. To the member who asked this question: the Leader of the Opposition only uses this argument on the days he is at community groups denying the minus five per cent target.                     I thank the Leader of the House for giving me the direct quote I was just referring to. I am asked about international arrangements, I am asked about China, and this question can only be relevant to this House if it relates to a public policy decision of the Australian government. That is carbon pricing. I am making the very simple point that the Leader of the Opposition only uses arguments about China on the days that he is at community groups and he is denying the minus five per cent target. For example, at a seniors forum on 18 July he said -                      'And the other crazy thing about it at this same time that our country is proposing to reduce emissions by five per cent, just five per cent, the Chinese are proposing to increase their emissions by 500 per cent.' The Leader of the Opposition was out using this China example to decry a minus five per cent target.                     Then, when he is blogging on Mamamia and he thinks people might be interested in climate change, he is out there saying the opposition accepts a minus five per cent target.                     This question is indicative of a Leader of the Opposition and an opposition generally that cannot be taken seriously on public policy, that will do or say anything on any given day, that will -                      On the question of international action and China, when the Leader of the Opposition is talking to a different audience, then he is a big supporter of the minus five per cent target. If you are going to be taken seriously in this country on public policy, you have to be prepared to say the same thing on every occasion.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. The government certainly understands that investment in skills is absolutely critical to enabling people to remain in the workforce, particularly in an economy that is modernising, and to enable Australia to be competitive in that economy. We are taking a number of important investment steps to make sure that we do skill up our workforce, not only for people who are in the workforce now but for kids who are starting on their education journey through school and high school, into vocational training and out into the workforce.                  In the last three years, there has been an investment of nearly $11 billion in improving skills and training, compared with some $6.8 billion under the Howard government. There are record numbers of apprentices and trainees improving their skills and their future employment opportunities. Importantly, in the last budget, where there was a strong emphasis on skills, again there was one of the largest ever skills package that we have seen - some $3 billion invested over six years - driving a new skills and participation agenda, with a particular emphasis on what we on this side believe is crucial, and that is modernising our apprenticeship system. We have seen incentives for apprentices and employees totalling approximately $1.1 billion just over the last financial year, and there are encouraging signs in apprenticeship take-up.                 But we do note that around 40 per cent of working Australians - that is some 4.5 million working Australians - do not have adequate literacy skills for employment. That is certainly the case for those who are unemployed, and we need to do something about that. So there are investments, specifically $500 million up to 2010, for those in the workforce; but, importantly, we are also conducting the first ever collection of national early development indexed data, which tells us how our kids are placed when they start on their learning journey. This is a world first, something that we on this side of the House are very proud of. It measures a range of indices - physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity and the like - to give us a sense of the kind of investment and policies we need when kids are starting out on their learning journey.                  In addition, we have a significant overall investment in education. I spoke about it yesterday in the House - some $65 billion that this government is investing, almost double what was invested by the previous government. Of particular note are the investments in things like literacy and numeracy. We know that literacy and numeracy are the basics, the building blocks, for people on their education journey, and we on this side of the House have committed some $540 million to make sure that literacy and numeracy support is in place so that people can go on to get good jobs.                  Finally, I cannot help but mention the investment in trade training centres. As anyone who has been in a trade training centre - and I know there are many on this side of the House - knows, this is something that this Gillard Labor government is very proud of. Every kid in Australia will get the opportunity of skills training in first-class facilities so that they will have skills in the workforce into the future. It is absolutely central to our agenda. I was asked whether there were any obstacles to this investment. The fact is that the obstacle sits opposite. The opposition - Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne, who has been thrown out of the House yet again -                      continue to announce cuts to education. They started in August 2010 when they announced cuts to things like the trade training centres. On 8 February, they announced even more cuts, a total of some $2.8 billion they committed. Now we have a $70 billion promise to cut and we know that education will suffer. On this side of the House, we will support the education of Australians into the future.                      I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have made many statements about that in this House. I stand by every one of them but what I am not going to stand for is the Leader of the Opposition in his question verballing and his presumptions about the motivations of the member for Dobell in determining to resign from the chairpersonship of a committee. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the statement he made, which was about the best workings of that committee.

  Of course I am aware of statements made by Kathy Jackson. Kathy Jackson is a union official. Unions, are, of course, the organisations that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to put out of business as part of the Work Choices agenda.                 On the issues that he has raised about the member for Dobell, can I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: another day and he digs himself deeper into the mud of hypocrisy on this question. Can I remind the Leader of the Opposition there is only one member of the federal parliament who has been charged with a criminal offence. That is a Liberal Party senator who has been charged with an offence against a person and an offence against property, and those charges are obviously coming to trial and going through appropriate criminal processes. It is not appropriate in respect of that Liberal senator for conclusions to be drawn about her innocence or guilt beforehand. The Leader of the Opposition said that. He said:                 The matter is now before the courts where I understand it will be contested and she should be extended the presumption of innocence.                 That is in relation to a criminal charge and I repeat again: the only member of this parliament facing criminal charges is a Liberal senator.                 On the question of the matters involving the member for Dobell, as is well known, there is a Fair Work Australia investigation in progress and I believe it is appropriate to wait for the outcome of any such investigation.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for confirming what I have said to the parliament - that there is only one member of parliament charged with a criminal offence.                  For the member for Dobell, people know there are Fair Work Australia investigations in process and the appropriate thing to do is to wait for the outcome of those investigations.                 Can I also remind the Leader of the Opposition not only is he mired in the hypocrisy of applying a completely different standard to a Liberal senator than any standard he extends to the member for Dobell; he is mired in hypocrisy in that when in government he was the first one as Leader of Government Business to get to this dispatch box to defend Liberal members who were in various scrapes and to say that they should be extended the presumption of innocence and that people should not act or draw conclusions until investigations came to an end. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that at that time he sat behind Prime Minister Howard, who said - and I specifically adopt these words as my own:                 _ a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for.                 He was talking about a police investigation dealing with three Liberal MPs. He went on to say:                 It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then if it is appropriate I will have something to say.                 Prime Minister Howard was right then. I adopt those words now in relation to the member for Dobell and the Fair Work Australia investigation.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I also thank her along with a large number of other members for attending with me, the Minister for Health and Ageing and Minister Mark Butler a Medicare Locals event in this parliament this morning. This was the first 19 Medicare Locals who are out there now bringing together services so that they can better offer community members who live in their local area coordinated care.                 Of course, this has been part of the rebuilding of the health system we have needed to do as a result of the way it was when we inherited it in 2007, where of course the Leader of the Opposition had left it short of money, short of doctors and short of nurses - indeed, short of everything that goes to making a health system. He certainly left it short of any reform vision. He was happy for it to just gently decline, with the Commonwealth's share of funding into hospitals going down and down and down, as the waiting time that Australians had for emergency department care and elective surgery care just went up and up and up.                 So we have had a lot to do, and today we took some more steps forward. We have reached a historic health reform agreement - a big change to our health system; as big as what was achieved under Medicare - which has put our health system, and particularly our hospitals, on a proper path for funding. We will be there as an equal partner in growth in hospitals - a very important reform.                 But we recognise that more needs to be done, and particularly that many Australians end up in hospitals when they did not need to be there. We have very high hospitalisation rates compared with many countries that are comparable to our own. In order to reduce those hospitalisation rates we need to get people better care in the community. That means that we need better coordination. The modern burden of disease is of chronic and complex conditions. People need their GP but they also need a range of other health practitioners. Medicare Locals are about assisting with that coordination and enabling local communities to identify where gaps and holes are there and what would best work for their local community to fill those gaps and holes.                 Then, of course, the health system does require capital, and one of the things that we have been very concerned about is the differential health outcomes between people in metropolitan Australia and regional and rural Australia, where there is a traceable difference in life expectancy. In order to make a difference for health care in regional and rural Australia, we have been making sure that capital is provided to bring in new facilities and to bring old facilities up to better standards in regional areas. That is why this morning I was very pleased, with the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Regional Australia, to announce that we are opening a new round of the Health and Hospitals Fund - an amount of $475 million. Applications are open and will close in October. We will make the necessary provisions and announce the results as part of the budget preparation process in 2012.

  What I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that decisions about how fair work processes will roll out are, of course, a matter for Fair Work Australia. So they need to make those decisions themselves and independently. What I can also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that perhaps she might be better spending her time directing her attention to why Senator Brandis has involved himself in a New South Wales Police matter in quite the way that he has.                     I can certainly assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have not been involved in trying to put political pressure on police. I wonder if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can give the same guarantee.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I would also like to acknowledge Mathew's presence in the gallery today and say how proud we all are of his achievements.                     We have spoken a lot about the patchwork economy over the past few months and indeed over the past year, and we have seen the contrast in our economy writ large in the past week. We have seen the substantial job losses at BlueScope, which have been caused by the high Australian dollar and other global factors, but on the other hand we have also seen substantial new investments in the resource sector in the past week and of course we have seen today the record BHP profit of $22 billion.                 The challenges of the patchwork economy go to the very core of our economic policy-making. Our last budget was focused exclusively on spreading the opportunities of the mining boom. That is why we had a $3 billion training and skills package at the core of that, it is why we must also begin to bring down the company tax rate, it is why we must also give small businesses a very substantial tax cut through the $6,500 instant asset write-off, and it is also why we must put in place the minerals resource rent tax, so we can use those resources from the highly profitable mining industry to cut taxes for struggling businesses elsewhere in our economy.                 I know the Leader of the Opposition believes that mining companies are paying too much tax and he believes they should pay less, but what is even more astounding is that he believes that other businesses that are not in the fast lane must have an increase in their company tax rate, and that was the policy that he took to the last election. This is stunningly stupid economic policy. The Australian people deserve, through the MRRT, a fair share of the resources of our country. How the Liberal Party could go around the country arguing that we should not have a resource rent tax, to give a tax cut to small business and to give a tax cut to other businesses through a reduction in the corporate tax rate, is simply astounding. But how he could then compound that by arguing for an increase in the company tax rate just demonstrates how reckless he is and how big a risk he and the shadow Treasurer are to our economy.                 At the heart of our reform agenda is a strict fiscal policy. We have put in place a strict fiscal policy to bring our budget back to surplus. It is a strategy that has been endorsed by the IMF and the international rating agencies. We have made a very important advance with that fiscal policy this week by announcing the Parliamentary Budget Office. This is very important because those opposite went through the last election with an $11 billion black hole in their budget estimates and they tried to hoodwink the Australian people that their numbers added up, but at the end of the day the department of finance and Treasury found that they did not add up after the election and that there was an $11 billion black hole. They will have nowhere to hide as they go through to the next election, because they will have to submit their costings to the Parliamentary Budget Office or the Department of Treasury. This is important. The shadow Treasurer has now said that there was a $70 billion hole at the core of their budget estimates. That was repeated by the shadow finance spokesman a few days ago, but today the Leader of the Opposition has said that they did not say that and that is just fanciful. What this proves is that he will say anything and do anything. What does not drive this Leader of the Opposition is the national interest. It is just his short-term political interests. His statements today demonstrate just how unqualified he is and how unfit he is for high office.

  Firstly, I say to the shadow minister for education that I was a little amused this morning when I saw the Leader of the Opposition on ABC24 News Breakfast saying that, if question time had proceeded yesterday, he had lots of questions on jobs. I thought stand-up comedy finished with the Leader of the Opposition!                     Exactly! Come in, spinner! I thank the shadow Treasurer for confirming in this parliament that they do not care about -                      I thank the shadow Treasurer for laying bare the political aspirations of the Liberal Party: all about themselves; they never cared anything about the jobs of the Australian people. And to the shadow minister who asked the question -                      Maybe, instead of screaming, he might like to listen to the answer.                     No - of course, he wants to keep screaming because that is what they are like as well: not serious about their roles in this parliament. To the shadow minister who asked the question, I would say this: he has asked me a question about the decision of the -                      He has asked me a question about the decision of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party in relation to the payment of some expenses. I would refer the shadow minister to the statement of the Liberal Party's Victorian director on 5 May 2011 where he was dealing with the question of payment by the Liberal Party of expenses in a defamation incurred by a Liberal member, where he said:                   The suggestion that there is any conflict of interest for the Liberal Party to support one of its parliamentarians in a defamation action arising from his public duties, when in opposition, is ridiculous.                 Then, of course, Premier Baillieu was also questioned about the matter. I say to the Liberal Party: what this proves is the stinking hypocrisy which is driving it each and every day. The Liberal Party paying defamation expenses for a member - apparently that is okay. A Liberal Party member is charged with criminal offences. We do the right thing and make no presumptions about her guilt or innocence, and they ask us to do that, but in relation to the member for Dobell they are not prepared to do the same. The Liberal Party: always prepared to throw allegations of cover-ups against other people, but the Leader of the Opposition knew for months that one of his members had been criminally charged and said nothing about it until he was asked. The Liberal Party: always very keen to say that the member for Dobell should surrender his committee chair position, but a Liberal Senator who is charged with criminal offences is apparently fine.                   Frankly, what really needs to happen here are common standards, and common standards require the following: if people are under investigation then we make no assumptions and we allow that investigation to take its course. That is what we have been prepared to do every day regarding a member of parliament in the other place. That is what the Leader of the Opposition should do regarding the member for Dobell. Anything else is hypocrisy that is fuelled by the opposition's political interest. As the shadow Treasurer has just laid plain before this parliament, the Liberal Party does not care about anything else - not about jobs, not about health, not about education, not about the economy, not about anything else - except one job and that is a job for the Leader of the Opposition. While they are there, mired in their hypocrisy, we will get on with the job of leading this nation.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for the only decent question asked by a non-government member during question time today. I do not know whether it is only me who is amused or whether it may be amusing others that the only non-government member prepared to ask a question about the economy is from the Greens! We cannot get one from the once-great Liberal Party. I do not know if that is amusing only to me or whether it might amuse people more broadly. As the Liberal Party sinks in its stinking hole of mud and hypocrisy, I have been asked a question by the member for Melbourne, which is on a serious issue - that is, the jobs of Australian workers.                 To the member for Melbourne I say: we understand that the economic circumstances of today, where the Australian economy is strong in its fundamentals -                      To the member for Indi, why is she cutting industry assistance? Maybe she wants to justify that. Why is she cutting industry assistance -                      ripping half a billion dollars of industry support away from manufacturing workers? It is because -                      the member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition think manufacturing workers are good backdrops for a photo, but they do not think anything else about them. That is the only thing they have ever thought about them. They do not care about their jobs and they do not care about industry assistance for their jobs.                 To the member for Melbourne, we are in economic times where, yes, the turbocharged nature of the resources boom is keeping the Australian dollar high, and that is putting pressure on other industry segments, including manufacturing. We understood that this was going to happen, so we have been working on it and setting up for it, understanding that this is where we would get to. We have strongly engaged with manufacturing through the framework of powering ideas - the innovation framework.                     We have strongly engaged with them through the procurement statement that has, as a subset, the Buy Australian at Home and Abroad initiative -                    The member for Indi then left the chamber.                     Under the Australian procurement statement we have supported the Buy Australian at Home and Abroad initiative, and this week we were pleased to announce that Peter Beattie would be the resources sector supplier envoy in relation to that. We have also had industry participation plans to work through. These are ways of ensuring that when we are a purchaser, when government is tendering, that we can leverage that purchasing power for the creation of an Australian Industry Participation Plan. We also have the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme, which does the same sort of leveraging when people seek particular arrangements, as well as the Supplier Access to Major Projects program, which leverages against government decision-making procurement and procurement directed at Australian suppliers. We understand that in this period of change we need to stay very strongly engaged with manufacturing. I believe manufacturing has a future in this country. It will require a government that values jobs and values manufacturing to work with it, and we are such a government.

  I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question. He is respected as a person who has served the justice community with distinction. It is well known that on Tuesday of this week the New South Wales Police Force indicated that it is conducting an internal assessment to determine whether a criminal offence has occurred in respect of matters concerning a member of this House.                     Mr McCLELLAND:                     I should say and emphasise at the outset that I have full confidence in the integrity and independence of the New South Wales Police Force -                    The member for Mayo then left the chamber.                     Mr McCLELLAND:                     and indeed its fine leadership. In fact, the police service has a right to undertake its important statutory responsibilities without political interference. This is confirmed in the 'United Nations Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors', which provides that states shall ensure that prosecutors are able:                  To perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment [or] improper interference ...                 Conversely, police forces and prosecutors have a corresponding obligation to ensure that they exercise their powers 'independently and be free from political interference'. That is stated as a quote from the 'Standards of Professional Responsibility and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors'. They have that right and we are entitled to, and should indeed, respect that right.                  Those international principles are reflected in domestic laws and guidelines for police services and prosecutors in the prosecution guidelines of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which specify that he is not to be influenced by possible political advantage, disadvantage or embarrassment to the government or any political group or party. I understand that the New South Wales guidelines reflect a similar sentiment. Indeed, the statement of values of the New South Wales Police Force specifically states that they are to conduct their role with impartiality. Indeed they do, and they are entitled to be respected for that fact.                  In that context, it is quite irresponsible for any politician to take a course of action that has the potential to tarnish the public's perception of that complete impartiality. Fundamentally, we should appreciate in this House that we are legislators; we are not prosecutors. It is not our role to prejudge issues that are the subject of investigation or, more significantly, to attempt to induce police or prosecutors to take a particular course of action.                 I, as I have done on a number of occasions, Senator Brandis and others - any member of the public - can refer to police officers an issue of concern in respect of a potential breach of the law, but to take action that purports to induce them is crossing that line. I, in my role as Attorney-General, would caution all members in the strongest possible terms about embarking upon that very dangerous slope.

  One of these days the shadow minister will ask a question about Australian schools, but it clearly will not be today.                     I do find this kind of stupidity from the opposition amusing; that is right. In answer to the shadow minister's question - as they bellow and scream the way they normally do - I did make that statement about News Limited. I did it at a time when Australians were watching issues in the United Kingdom and they were a cause of community concern. There was, for a period a couple of years ago, a UK scandal involving parliamentary entitlements. People would recall that. When people saw that on their TV screens in the UK it did cause a national conversation about parliamentarian entitlements, even though there was no evidence of anything happening of the same nature here and, indeed, the rules were very different here. I made a very simple point about the nature of our national conversation following what people were watching on their TV screens through the News of the World scandal.                 What I believe is entirely different here, and what the shadow minister is clearly not understanding, is it is one thing for us as a nation to have public policy debates; it is another thing to prejudge a matter in relation to an individual. I am concerned about Senator Brandis's conduct in relation to the matter the Attorney-General has just described, but Senator Brandis did say one very perceptive thing on 19 August. He said:                 Senator Fisher is being prosecuted. She maintains her innocence. She is entitled to a fair trial just as the member for Dobell is entitled to a fair trial.                 That is where the matter would and should rest if the opposition were not fuelled by hypocrisy and their own narrow political interest. As the shadow Treasurer has made abundantly clear today the only thing that motivates them, the only thing they care about, the only issues they will ever pursue in this parliament are ones -                      which they think will enable them to change jobs. They have got no concern about the Australian public, no concern about jobs, no plans in health, no plans in education and no knowledge of how to run the Australian economy. All they have left in the back of the cupboard is Work Choices and a $70 billion black hole and they pursue their hypocrisy and self-interest day after day - it is truly disgusting.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. She has been very interested in how health reform is delivering for the whole country but particularly in her electorate, where over $50 million is being invested in emergency departments, in a cancer centre, in GP superclinics, in a new assessment unit and in accommodation for cancer patients. So there is good news, which those constituents in the electorate of Page are seeing evidence of each and every day. We are very proud to be part of a government that is moving forward on all fronts in terms of health reform.                 Of course a big step was taken yesterday in part of our health reforms where this House passed the world's first plain-packaging legislation for cigarettes. It was a big occasion and a very courageous step that this parliament and our nation is taking. I must mention, especially when tomorrow is Daffodil Day, that we have those from the Cancer Council here in the gallery today. I am sure they are pleased not only that so many of us are wearing their scarves and badges but that this step that is being taken will help to reduce the toll that cancer causes in our community, because so much of that cancer is still caused from tobacco related disease.                 Unfortunately, although the Leader of the Opposition did not oppose the main legislation that was debated in the House, a very large number from his backbench spoke passionately against it including the member for Mitchell, who said that there was no point bothering about such things because life kills anyway, so why would you bother doing anything to reduce the harms caused by tobacco? What a disgrace.                 This was equalled only by the member for Dawson, who said that smoking was fun, so why would we pass this sort of legislation? He showed absolutely no understanding as to why we are trying to reduce the harms of tobacco. Coming into this parliament and making these sorts of ridiculous comments is not a good way to set an example for our community.                     Of course, in relation to many health reform measures we have seen the Liberal Party be entirely inconsistent. We have had the Leader of the Opposition saying, on no less than six occasions, that he supports activity based funding and we have had the shadow minister telling the Financial Review and others that they will vote against that in the parliament. We have the Leader of the Opposition setting up a temporary safety and quality commission. He did not make it permanent; when we made it permanent they voted against it. He promised he was going to build e-health records in five years. He did not deliver those. We are now delivering those and they are now opposed to them. He said he supported more transparency in our hospitals; he did not make that happen. We are making that happen and they now oppose it. The Leader of the Opposition spent his time as health minister saying he could have done something, he should have done something, he would have done something, but he did not. We are doing it and it is time they got on board and supported us.

  I am glad we have shamed the Leader of the Opposition into asking a question about jobs. Unfortunately, he does not bother to keep himself up to date with these matters because he does not really care. If he had bothered to keep himself up to date with these matters instead of being paralysed, sitting there just thinking about muck and hypocrisy for a week, if he had done a day's work this week, he would have realised that Dennis O'Neill has been appointed as the next steel supplier advocate and Peter Beattie has been appointed as the country's first resource sector supplier envoy.                 On the second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question he will continue - and this question is no doubt part of that campaign - to distort and misrepresent to the Australian people what the job losses at BlueScope were about. He is desperate to continue his fear and misrepresentation campaign so that even though this is about the jobs of 1,000 workers he will misrepresent to the Australian community that this is about carbon pricing. I directly engaged with the CEOs of the major steel companies. I did not go through a council, I did it myself. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and others have all been directly involved with the steel industry and we did that in order to get the Steel Transformation Plan right. And before the Leader of the Opposition continues this fear campaign and this misrepresentation, I would refer him to the words of the CEOs of those steel companies, where they very clearly said that the government had worked with them and had settled an outcome in carbon pricing and had heard their concerns. BlueScope, of course, said very, very upfront in relation to Monday's announcement, that it was not about carbon pricing. The government had worked with BlueScope, which is why we were able to make the announcements that we did on Monday, and we will continue to work with BlueScope.                 The Leader of the Opposition sits there and at the moment he has got no plan at all to assist manufacturing. Indeed, he stands for cutbacks - half a million dollars out of the automobile industry assistance that has been provided. Of course he is bleating there about carbon tax. It has nothing to do with carbon pricing. This is $500 million of industry assistance that has been promised to the industry for a long period of time, and it would be ripped away. The Leader of the Opposition is going to face a big choice when this parliament resumes, because we will be bringing in here the Steel Transformation Plan. He has made an art form of standing next to blue-collar workers with a hard hat on and a high-vis vest and pretending that really he is working-class Tony. It will be very interesting to see whether or not the man from North Shore will put his hand up for steelworkers when the time comes.

  I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question. An important piece of legislation passed the parliament this week: the government's carbon-farming legislation. The Carbon Farming Initiative will open up very important economic opportunities for farmers, for foresters, and for other land managers, to earn revenue from cutting pollution and storing carbon in the landscape. The CFI, the Carbon Farming Initiative, is a market mechanism and it is expected to generate investment of an estimated 460 million carbon credits to the year 2050, a very significant economic opportunity.                 The government also recognises that the CFI needs to be complemented by other significant investments in our land sector so that farmers and others can realise the full benefits. That is why the government announced a commitment to a further $1.7 billion of revenue from the carbon pricing mechanism to support the Carbon Farming Initiative and reward important co-benefits to biodiversity and enhance the resilience of the landscape.                 The coalition's position on the Carbon Farming Initiative has, I think, betrayed farmers and demonstrated what a costly shambles their policy-making process is and how they appear to have lost interest in anything constructive to do with policy.                  At first, the coalition responded very positively to the Carbon Farming Initiative. The shadow minister was quite optimistic and positive and supportive about it. But then when it came to a vote in the House of Representatives, the opposition voted against it. The legislation found its way to the Senate, of course, where the opposition then filibustered for no fewer than 16 hours and ultimately voted against the legislation. It is a very curious position for the National Party in particular to be adopting. But after all of that, when the carbon-farming legislation came back to the House of Representatives this week, the shadow minister declared that any future coalition government would not in fact repeal the legislation. It did not call a division and, having voted against it twice, they are now happy to let it go, and he said:                 We will not be abolishing the bill. It is important to give this message to potential actors and investors in the space.                 This capitulation was apparently driven by a recognition that it is important to give farmers and other stakeholders certainty. That is a welcome recognition.                  But the trouble for the coalition is that the Carbon Farming Initiative, and certainty for farmers and other stakeholders, is inextricably linked to the passage of carbon-pricing legislation. Very importantly, in the carbon-pricing legislation that will come before the House in coming weeks, there is $1.7 billion worth of assistance to support the CFI and people in the land sector, no less than $420 million for the Carbon Farming Futures Program, which will deliver research and methods for crediting carbon in the landscape, and a number of other important measures. If they do genuinely support these things but not the carbon price, this would mean another $1.7 billion hole in the policy that the average Australian household is going to have to fund. Already, of course, households are going to have to fund $1,300 more in taxes to pay for their silly policy position that will achieve nothing. Their policy-making in this area has all the same credibility as the claim of the Leader of the Opposition that a tonne of carbon dioxide is weightless. Their policy is a joke.

  I say to the shadow Treasurer that he may want to do a bit of research and he may want to talk to people in the steel industry. He may want to speak specifically to the CEO of BlueScope and the CEO of OneSteel, and he may want to speak to them specifically about the way in which the government worked through their concerns with carbon pricing. He may want to bother doing some reading and when he does that reading he should read through the statements they made when the carbon-pricing package was announced. And he may want to do some reading on what BlueScope said when it announced job losses earlier this week, that it was not to do with carbon pricing. Then he may want to reflect on the question of hypocrisy and whether you should come into this parliament pretending you care about steelworker jobs when you are going to come into this parliament in the next few sitting weeks and put your hand up against $300 million of assistance for steelworkers.                 Let's be absolutely clear about this - absolutely clear to the workers at BlueScope and the workers beyond: this side of the parliament will come in here and vote for a $300 million transformation plan. We are determined to deliver assistance to them, and we will deliver assistance to them. Those on the other side should be judged on how they vote on that piece of legislation. The shadow Treasurer will come in and put his hand in the air and say, 'I don't care at all about steelworking jobs; I don't care about them at all.' That is what he will do with his vote in the parliament, just like he did during the global financial crisis, where he came in and said, 'I don't care about the jobs of Australians,' and just as the opposition will in the minerals resource rent tax debate, where Australians will see profitable mining companies, and that is a good thing. They will see results like they saw with BHP today, and they are a good thing. They will see a turbocharged, highly profitable industry, and the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition will come into this parliament and they will vote against the minerals resource rent tax. They will deny other companies and small businesses a tax cut, they will deny Australian workers a superannuation increase and they will deny Australians more infrastructure.                 So, for the shadow Treasurer, I am very happy to debate economic credentials and supporting Australian jobs with him any day of the week. In the global financial crisis we acted and saved jobs; you recommended doing nothing and voted against what we did. We are here engaged with manufacturing and its future; you think manufacturing workers are a good backdrop for a photo opportunity, but otherwise you could not care if they were all made redundant. We are here managing the economy during a period of economic transition, keeping up our credentials as a great free-trading nation, and you are over there flirting with protectionism. Unless we intimidate you out of it - like we had to with the apples bill - you will try to take us out of the World Trade Organisation global rules based order. So it is time the shadow Treasurer actually stumped up and said something sensible about the future of this country.                     The connection is jobs, and you will never understand it.                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.

  I very much thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He knows that the Labor government are very serious about supporting Australia's pensioners because we do understand how difficult it is for pensioners and other people on fixed incomes to manage their household budgets. Of course, it was this government that delivered record increases in the pension in 2009. Since September 2009, pensioners on the maximum rate have been receiving $128 extra a fortnight if they are single and around $116 a fortnight extra for couples combined - never delivered by those opposite but delivered by this Labor government - to make sure that pensioners are able to manage their household budgets.                 It was also this government that improved the indexation system for pensioners to make sure that the pension keeps up with pensioners' costs of living. That was why this government also increased the utilities allowance by $400 and why we have introduced a new seniors work bonus, meaning that those pensioners who are doing some part-time work are able to keep more of what they earn.                 Our record demonstrates that we stand up for Australia's pensioners. We are, of course, going to make sure that we do that when we introduce a carbon price. We do understand how important it is to support Australia's 3.4 million pensioners - whether they are aged pensioners, disability support pensioners, people on the carer payment or veteran pensioners. All of these pensioners will receive extra assistance to make sure that they can manage with the carbon price. These are going to be real and permanent increases to their pensions - something that pensioners know they can rely on from this side of the parliament.                 We know, and pensioners know, where the risks to their standard of living really lie. Pensioners know that, for 12 long years, this Leader of the Opposition and the Howard cabinet refused to deliver an increase to their pension. We know there was an actual proposal for an increase to the pension that went to the cabinet that this Leader of the Opposition was a member of, and it was rejected by those opposite. We also know that it is this Leader of the Opposition that has said he intends to claw back the household assistance that we intend to pay to pensioners to fill his $70 billion black hole. That is where he intends to get it from. The shadow Treasurer, who has just been thrown out the parliament, let the cat out of the bag on the ABC's 7.30 program just last week when he said:                 I'm not saying we'll necessarily cut the pension.                 What pensioners want to know is how much of the pension you will cut, how much of the pension supplement you will cut and how much of their pensioner concessions you will cut to fill the $70 billion black hole that you have created. Pensioners deserve to know.

  Members should be advised that the government was aware of that report in designing the regulatory framework that will apply to the arrangements that we are developing in Australia. There was some debate, I think five to six weeks ago, regarding the extent and the intensity of that regulatory framework and, indeed, in many cases quite strong penalties that are being applied to prevent that sort of behaviour. That information has been within the knowledge of the government. It has been taken into consideration in the design of the framework. In terms of the relevant markets that are part of that design, the relevant minister has advised the public of those matters.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. This government certainly understands the importance of investing in skills education. We are taking important steps to make sure that we improve the skills of Australian students. Yesterday I had the opportunity of meeting with the Australian Apprentice of the Year, Jason Bryan. I got a good sense from him of how much excitement there is amongst the trades and apprentices about the big effort that is coming from this government on skills training. Over the last three years, we have made an investment of some $10.9 billion in improving skills and training for our future workforce.                 It is important to let the House know that we have also made significant investments specifically in vocational training itself, an investment of some $11 billion in three financial years - 2008 to 2010. Of that, we have invested over $800 million in capital works upgrading and modernising hundreds of training facilities around the country. We have also invested significantly to make sure that the global financial crisis does not impact significantly on apprenticeships. We can see that we have very encouraging signs of an uptake in apprenticeships. We were sitting at around 448,000 apprenticeships in September 2010, the highest number ever recorded.                 As well as that, we recognise that quite often when young Australians are in school they may not choose a higher education route. They might want to get into that skills pathway whilst they are still at school, so we are investing $37.5 million in creating national trade cadetships, providing a pathway with the Australian Curriculum for secondary school students who are interested in a career or a trade. I have spoken about our investment in trade training centres, some $2.5 billion over 10 years to enable every high school student in Australia to have access to a trade training centre. That is an important investment.                 I was asked about the risks to the investment. I have to say that when it comes to political slogans - and I remember the three-word slogan 'Just Say No', which I think may have been President Reagan's wife's slogan - there is one that really gets members of the opposition going, and it is trade training centres. All you have to say is 'trade training centres' and they are out of the blocks like they are training for the London Olympics. I can inform the House that we continually see members of the opposition showing up at these trade training centre openings. We had the member for Mackellar at the Pittwater Hospitality Trade Training Centre on 28 June - she was very happy to attend. We had the member for Barker only a couple of weeks ago at the Lower Murray Trade Training Centre - very happy to attend. Of course, we had the member for Macquarie attending a centre, as was reported in the Hawkesbury Gazette of 23 March. There she is: 'Trade training centre unveiled' - I recognise that face.                 The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister have put on record their cuts to education, which include cuts to the very trade training centres that opposition members cannot wait to be a part of the opening of. If you ever wanted a more significant comparison between a commitment to real policy that is helping young Australians and the hypocrisy of those opposite, this is it.

 I thank the member for his question. First and foremost I would say to the member that I know the opposition have been out there fundamentally distorting the impact of carbon pricing, and one of the areas they have been fundamentally distorting is the dairy industry, where they have been trying to pretend to people that there are big costs coming and have been trying to scare people. They believe it is all part of their political strategy and they do not want people to have the facts. In our carbon pricing package, as the member may have seen, there are streams of assistance that will be available to assist people. He may want to get some of that information. I doubt, for example, that he has been out in his electorate talking to pensioners about how they are going to benefit and get more money than they need to assist with the average impact of having priced carbon.                     Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: there are 40,000 people directly employed in the dairy sector who want -                      To the member who asked the question, I went to the question of assistance that we are providing to pensioners. Tax cuts and family payments are No. 1, because I doubt that he has bothered to inform his constituents of that. And No. 2: of course we are doing that because we expect that there will be some costs passed through on items where carbon pricing has had an effect. The amount of those flow-through costs is less than a cent in a dollar - it is 0.7 per cent of CPI. The Leader of the Opposition has been out misrepresenting that to the Australian people and saying that it is astronomical. It is 0.7 per cent of CPI, and people will have assistance as they meet those costs. Indeed, around four million Australian households will come out better off.                  I am familiar with the electorate that the member represents. In that electorate particularly I think he should look at the compensation statistics and the way in which people will be assisted. We will continue to work with the dairy industry and get them the facts. They will never get them from the opposition. When we get them the facts, that will help them understand the modest impacts of carbon pricing as opposed to the fear campaign to which they have been subjected.                  Finally, I would say to the member who asked the question: has he ever inquired of the Leader of the Opposition how the so-called direct action policy - the subsidy of polluters policy - is going to affect his electorate? Has he ever inquired about how it is going to be funded? The cost is $1,300 per family. Who is going to pay that? Has he ever asked whether the penalty clause in that policy will be leveraged against dairy farmers? Has he ever asked the Leader of the Opposition that? I suggest that he ask some of those questions because -                       the Leader of the Opposition's policy is the most costly way of getting carbon abatement. The member has a choice to make. No. 1: does he support the minus five per cent target at 2020? Yes or no. The Leader of the Opposition says all things to all people - the member can make his own decision. If the decision is yes, he supports the target. No. 2: does he support doing it in the least costly way or hitting those dairy farmers and his constituents with the new and onerous burdens that the Leader of the Opposition is planning for them?

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. This year's budget delivered on the Prime Minister's commitment on mental health is $2.2 billion in new measures - the largest ever mental health package in this country's history. Last week's COAG meeting heard a presentation from three members of the government's expert working group - Professor Patrick McGorry, Monsignor Cappo and Frank Quinlan - on mental health reform. I am pleased to report that COAG has agreed to conclude a new national partnership agreement on mental health by the end of this year. It focuses on accommodation supports and emergency department arrangements in particular.                  Meanwhile, states have been provided with our population modelling for future headspace sites for their comment to allow us to be in a position this calendar year to announce the next tranche of 15 headspace services. Discussions are also proceeding with state governments about our plans to roll out early psychosis centres or EPPICs with their support in their jurisdictions, and funding has started to flow to support up to 1,700 additional primary schools to take up the Kids Matter program to help kids build resilience and coping skills at that critical age                 Divisions of general practice and new Medicare Locals are receiving huge increases in funding, to the tune of 87 per cent, to deliver counselling services to hard to reach groups in the population, including people identified at risk of suicide.                 Unlike the opposition's policy in this area, which delivered not a jot for children and not a jot for adults experiencing mental illness, our package recognises the diverse impact of mental illness across the lifespan. Importantly in these challenging economic times, our package is properly costed and fully funded. The approach of the opposition, which I was asked about by the member for Wakefield, was essentially to say: 'If you want better mental health services in this country, we need to keep the broader health system back in the 20th century.' To pay for a policy that would deliver nothing for children and nothing for adults experiencing mental illness, the opposition would have junked e-health entirely, as the Minister for Health and Ageing has pointed out, leaving the broader health system instead to work on paper files forever. They would have trashed pricing reforms in the hospital system to deliver more efficient hospital services. Instead, they would have kept sending blank cheques to state governments every year. They would have withdrawn $350 million of funding for better GP infrastructure in local communities, and more. In total there would have been $1.4 billion of cuts to fund their mental health package. I note that is just one-fiftieth of the $70 billion of cuts that the now absent member for North Sydney has planned for our health services, our schools and our broader social services if he gets his way.                  The opposition's approach in this area is wrongheaded and it is fanciful. The COAG meeting last week confirmed that you can have mental health reform and broader health reform and you should have both.

  I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. We are concluding a parliamentary fortnight in which the government has got on with building the nation's future as the opposition has simply focused its sights on destroying the government. We have had our eyes focused on the future of millions of Australians; they have had their eyes focused on themselves, driven by self-interest every step of the way. We have had our eyes focused on prudent budget management; they have had their eyes focused in despair on trying to cover up a $70 billion black hole. We still do not know where the cuts are going to fall, how many pensioners are going to feel the pain, how many hospitals are going to feel the pain, how many schools are going to feel the pain and how much is going to be taken out of the defence of our nation. We just do not know.                     I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he cannot take it, he should just keep moving back. We have been focused on managing the economy of this nation. We have been focused on working with the resources sector as it grows, hungry for workers, hungry for skills and hungry for infrastructure. We have been focused on working with those industries that are feeling the burden of the high Australian dollar - manufacturing, tourism and international education.                 In this parliament we have passed 185 bills, remarkably 22 of them in the last fortnight. They have been world-leading bills like the plain paper packaging proposal, where, of course, we had to fight every step of the way to get the Liberal Party to break its addiction to big tobacco and do the right thing by Australians who suffer tobacco addiction. We have passed legislation for superannuation because Labor is and always will be the party of superannuation. We brought it in against the trenchant opposition of the Liberal Party. They fought it every step of the way. They said it would destroy Australian jobs. They said it would destroy the Australian economy. Does that sound familiar? The Liberal Party in full flight for a scare campaign. We have continued to deliver superannuation reform.                 We have continued to deliver our agenda in child care. When we came to government no-one cared about the ability of early childhood education to change life chances and to make a difference for the most disadvantaged children. No-one cared about any of that and no-one cared about the pressure on working families as they paid their childcare costs. We are very proud that we have increased the childcare tax rebate to 50 per cent. We focus day after day on increasing the quality of early childhood education, which is good for all children, particularly good for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.                     I am not surprised that members opposite are talking through that, because life chances of Australian children do not motivate them at all. Then, of course, this week we have passed another NBN bill, and they want to rip the National Broadband Network out of the ground, and we passed a carbon farming bill, something they have opposed but now said they will not take away.                 In the meantime the Liberal Party has been out advertising desperately trying to attract new candidates. I suspect the curriculum, if you want to be a Liberal Party candidate, is just learn to say 'No', and to help them on their way I table how to say 'No' in 500 languages. It will come in very handy for them.

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say that, as usual, he has missed the point. The point before this parliament today, and what the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer as a test of leadership, is whether he will join with the government in amending the Migration Act so that the government can pursue its determined arrangement with Malaysia to transfer asylum seekers. That is the question before the parliament today.                  Coming into the parliament today, I did expect to see these kinds of tactics from the opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition has to face up to a test - whether or not he is just full of slogans and sound bites or whether he will take seriously questions of Australia's national security. That is the key question after the High Court case: whether or not the Leader of the Opposition will pursue a strategy to wreck in his political interest or whether he will seek to work in the national interest. That is before the parliament for consideration and something the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer.                 On the question of refugee signatory countries, as the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, the government has entered into an arrangement with Malaysia. And in entering into that arrangement we have negotiated -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In direct answer to the question: as the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, the government has negotiated an arrangement with Malaysia where the refugee convention obligations this nation has freely assumed will be honoured in respect of the people that we transfer. This is the arrangement, which we have the most clear advice from experts within the Public Service, that will act as the clearest possible deterrent for people smugglers.                 I say to the Leader of the Opposition who asked this question: I detect hypocrisy here. This is the Leader of the Opposition who, during the election campaign, said his policy, if he were Prime Minister, would be a 'boat phone' - that is, he would make calls to patrol boats as he sat at the Lodge or Kirribilli requiring them to turn boats around. He knew that was not possible, but he was pretending to the Australian people that he would tow those boats back to Indonesia, which is not signatory to the refugee convention. As to the outcome for the people on those boats, he was never going to worry himself about that.                 So the Leader of the Opposition in the last election campaign marketed a sham policy behind a three-word slogan. If he had been able to implement it, it would have taken asylum seekers to a non-refugee convention signatory country with no protections. The issue now, post the High Court case, is: will the Leader of the Opposition finally deal with the facts of this policy debate and will he ensure, by working with the government to amend the Migration Act, that the government of the day can make the decisions it needs to make to have asylum seekers processed offshore or will he just go on wrecking? This is the test for the Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. As the House is aware and the member for Blair is aware, the government determined a number of months ago to commence negotiations with Malaysia. We did that because we wanted to have a policy with the maximum deterrence effect. We wanted to have a policy that would work to smash the people smugglers' business model - a policy that would work to deter people from getting on leaky boats and potentially losing their lives at sea; a policy that would build on what was achieved in the regional forum at Bali; a policy that would make possible bringing 4,000 more genuine refugees to this country from Malaysia, many of them people who would have waited years and years for an opportunity for a new start and a new life; a policy so that we would not see people losing their lives, but we would smash the people smugglers' business model and take more genuine refugees. That was the right policy then and it is the right policy now.                 In order to implement that policy, given the view taken by the High Court, we are determined to come to this parliament and seek to amend the Migration Act. The amendment that we bring to this parliament will be a broad amendment. It will enable this government, as it will enable any government in the future, to implement the policies and plans it believes best in relation to offshore processing. I understand that there is a difference between the government and the opposition on which policy and plan is the best one. The opposition has determined to support as its primary policy a processing centre in Nauru. That is despite the fact that we have clear advice that a centre in Nauru will not work. That is despite the fact that we have clear advice about the hundreds of millions of dollars of cost. That is in defiance of the advice that says people smugglers now know, because of processing on Nauru in the past, that people come from Nauru to this country. People smugglers now know that, of the people who were processed and resettled from Nauru, more than 90 per cent of them came to Australia, and so they are able to say to asylum seekers, whom they seek to prey upon and whose money they want to take, 'If you go to Nauru, you will get to Australia.' I want to send a very different message. I want to send a message which says, 'If you get on a boat then you will go to Malaysia.'                 We have made a different decision from the opposition, based on facts, based on advice and based on reality. We are not out there trying to pretend that black is white the way that the Leader of the Opposition is. That debate can continue but what is vitally needed in the national interest is putting the Migration Act in a form that puts executive government in the position it believed itself to be prior to the High Court case - that is, that it can implement decisions as it sees fit about offshore processing. We await to hear from the Leader of the Opposition, in this vital area of national interest, whether he will continue with sound bites and slogans or whether he will stump up and work with the government on a solution to the legislative issues that we face as a nation following the High Court case. We await the answer.

  Once again we see that when the opposition has a choice between talking about the future or talking about the past they always live in the past. The Leader of the Nationals seems to be unaware that the policy that he referred to was announced by the government in May. If he is interested in that policy I suggest he catch up with the policy announcements made at that time.

  I thank the honourable member for Robertson for her question. The answer to the question is that the most effective deterrent for people smuggling is the arrangement negotiated between Australia and Malaysia.                 The advice received by this government has been made available to the opposition. That advice is clear. The advice is that to break the people smugglers' business model you have to take away the product they sell. That advice says -                      The advice is clear. The advice has been made available to the opposition. That advice is that to break the people smugglers' business model it is necessary to remove the product they sell. The product they sell is a better chance of resettlement in Australia. Well over 80 per cent of the people who arrive in Australia by boat begin that boat journey from Malaysia. The most important and clearest message we can send is to return them to where they began that boat journey - not to Nauru, where they will be processed and the vast majority resettled in Australia. This is an arrangement which was been negotiated with Malaysia in consultation with the UNHCR. It involves an increase in our refugee intake and improved protection outcomes across the region.                 The very clear advice has now been made available to the Leader of the Opposition. We know the Leader of the Opposition is not big on experts. He does not like climate change experts, he does not like legal experts, he does not like experts when it comes to people smuggling. But the advice has been made clear: an outcome which involves Nauru alone, which would involve over 90 per cent of the people who are resettled from Nauru being resettled in Australia or New Zealand, is no disincentive at all.                 We know Nauru will not work. We also know that it is an expensive option. The member for Cook said earlier this year that Nauru would cost 'significantly less' than the Malaysia arrangement. The opposition leader said that Nauru could be up and running 'at a relatively low cost'. We know costings are not their strong point but they got this one particularly wrong, because advice released by me on the weekend shows my department's estimate of the cost of a detention facility at Nauru over four years at just under $1 billion.                     If you disagree with that, release your own costings. If the opposition do not agree with that they are free to release their own costings, but I doubt we will see that. This is just the operational cost, not the capital cost. Here is a test for the Leader of the Opposition. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said:                  I think that our country should have the best border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I'm prepared to work constructively to give the Government, to restore to the Government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it.                 The situation is clear. The government believes that it needs the Malaysia arrangement. If the Leader of the Opposition is good to his word and is prepared to work for the national interest he will support legislation to enable the government to break the people smugglers' business model by the arrangement with Malaysia.

  The situation is clear. There is an agreement with Malaysia for the transfer of 800 people. That remains. We believe the advice to us, which is that this is the best and most effective way to break the people smugglers' business model.                 The member for Cook argues that Nauru would be a more effective disincentive. He says it is clear that Malaysia does not work because of the number of people that arrived after the announcement. If that logic applied it would apply to the Nauru announcement of the previous government. It is interesting to look at the figures: 1,998 people arrived after the announcement of Nauru in the same period -                      The situation remains as it has been previously outlined - that is, the governments of Australia and Malaysia have agreed to the transfer of 800 people. The government of Malaysia has made it clear that they would review that arrangement at the end of the transfer of the 800 people, and I welcome the implication from the shadow minister's question that the opposition are prepared to support the government's legislation.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to travel with him to cyclone affected areas and we actually met with a number of people from Mission Beach, who talked to me about the safe harbour arrangements that he describes in the parliament today and which he certainly described to me during the course of that visit. So I do thank him for continuing to represent very strongly and continuously the needs of people in the local area.                 What I believe the member for Kennedy would agree with is that the reconstruction work from the cyclone is progressing and that funds have been flowing to North Queensland, just as they are flowing in other parts of Queensland. The Cardwell Esplanade and Marine Infrastructure Recovery Project has been officially launched, marking an important step forward in plans to reconstruct Cardwell after the devastating effects of the cyclone. The local mayor, Bill Shannon, who the member for Kennedy and I had an opportunity to talk to when I travelled with him, said on 19 August this year that the launch of that project symbolised a new phase of recovery work for the region and that it was building something new and better for those towns.                 All of that work has been possible because of the $15 million the state and federal governments have made available. Bill Shannon also said that he felt that restoring Cardwell foreshore to its former beauty and functionality was the best thing that could be done for the town, considering its importance as a tourist attraction and as a recreation and relaxation area for local residents. A 1.4 kilometre section of the Bruce Highway, part of the Cardwell foreshore, and the Clump Point and Dunk Island Jetty will also be reconstructed through this package.                 Regarding the building of marine infrastructure, as raised directly by the member's question, I am aware that he is championing the cause and that he is passionate about building a safe boat harbour at Mission Beach. Earlier this year, he will remember, when he raised the matter with me I said the government would create an interdepartmental committee to look at these issues, and I understand the chair of the committee has met with the member for Kennedy. The committee will report back to the government and inform our consideration on this matter. In the meantime, of course, we will continue to deliver the $5.6 billion that is being provided for reconstruction after the summer of natural disasters and we will continue to work strongly with the cyclone affected communities. I thank the member for his question.

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. The national accounts which were released last week show the underlying resilience of the Australian economy. The June quarter national accounts show that the economy grew by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. What they showed was a strong bounce back from the natural disasters in Queensland of earlier this year, which the Prime Minister was just talking about - the impact of the floods and the very substantial impact of Cyclone Yasi. Also, they show that there is an underlying strength more broadly right across the Australian economy. What we see is rising incomes, very strong investment and also very solid consumption. Those are the building blocks of a strong economy.                 If we go through the figures we can see that repeated time and time again. Corporate profits are growing strongly. There is also very solid wages growth. Businesses are investing with confidence, with strong growth in business investment: 1.7 per cent in the quarter and 10.2 per cent through the year. What this shows is an unprecedented investment pipeline that we have been talking about in this House through the past year. We also see that household consumption has been very solid: three per cent plus at trend. You would not necessarily think that was the case when you listen to some of the public commentary. Of course, some areas of the economy are soft, especially in retail, but overall Australians are still spending. Yes, they are saving more, but because their incomes are growing they are still spending at about trend. That was what was so pleasing about those figures.                 We have seen the unemployment rate tick up a bit, to 5.3 per cent. That is still remarkably low considering what we are seeing elsewhere among developed economies. But the interesting thing in the figures of last week is that we saw that hours worked also went up. If we were to recalculate what that meant in terms of new jobs this year alone, if those hours had gone to new jobs, there would be 110,000 additional jobs created this calendar year. So, once again, we are seeing the underlying strength that I was talking about before. We have seen 140,000 more Australians in jobs over the past 12 months and we have seen three-quarters of a million new jobs since the government came to office. That is supported by everybody on this side of the House.                 What all these figures confirm is that the Australian economy continues to outperform the economies of the rest of the developed world. We have done that despite the impact of the natural disasters which had a very big impact on our economy, and we have done it despite the fact that we have had continuing global instability over the past 18 months. I think these figures do serve as a reality check, particularly for those opposite who continue to talk the Australian economy down. For our part, what we celebrate with these figures is that the Australian economy has underlying strength. The Australian economy is one that can show strength despite everything that the world has been throwing at us.                  So we do have a bright future. We should look at the Australian economy and say that it is like a glass that is more than half full. We should not be saying that the glass is less than half full. These are strengths that serve our country well and that give people the confidence and the security that they can earn a decent income and take home a pay cheque to their family each week. This country has come through the biggest economic crisis we have seen on the globe for 75 years and it has come through with strength. That is something we can all be proud of.

  I sincerely thank the member for her question. It enables me to advise the House that on 6 October the government will host a future jobs forum. It will follow the tax forum. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer has just outlined to the House, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. Indeed, our economy is the envy of the world. We saw a good growth number. We continue to see unemployment at a far lower rate compared with countries like the US and the UK. We need to remind ourselves that we went into the global financial crisis with an unemployment rate around the same as the American unemployment rate. We have come out of the global financial crisis and into these days beyond with an unemployment rate that is pretty close to half the unemployment rate in the United States of America. So we are able to offer people the benefits and dignity of work, we are able to see growth in our economy and we are seeing rapid growth - turbocharged growth - in our resources sector, with more than $400 billion of investment in the pipeline.                 We understand that this also means that our currency is very high. Our Australian dollar is high and will be high for some period of time to come. That does put pressure on other sectors of the economy - what we have referred to as patchwork pressures. I therefore believe it is important that we bring together representatives of business, of unions, of representative employer organisations and academics to talk about jobs for the future. Our economic fundamentals are strong today, but there is nothing more important to this government than Australians having jobs, which is why we acted so quickly and effectively to support jobs during the global financial crisis. It is why we continue to work to support jobs today. It is why we have put in place the policies and plans that will enable us to see jobs in the future. This includes our work in skills and apprenticeships; our work in human capital generally; our work in rolling out infrastructure in roads, rail and ports; our work in building the National Broadband Network and bringing that new technology to Australia because it will equal new jobs; our work in pricing carbon and the creation of a clean energy future and clean energy jobs; our work with the manufacturing sector to ensure that we continue to be a country that makes things - and we will continue to resist the opposition's calls to take hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars away from our manufacturing sector. We will resist the opposition's calls to do that because, unlike them, we want to see a country where we continue to make automobiles and engage in high-value-added manufacturing.                 We believe it is an appropriate time, particularly following the tax forum, to bring together representatives to talk about jobs for the future. The government will be there and will be vitally interested in jobs. Of course, I expect the opposition to ignore the whole event because they are not interested in ensuring that Australians have the benefits and dignity of work.

  In relation to the question, as the member may well know, we worked hard with Malaysia to negotiate a set of protections for asylum seekers who were transferred to Malaysia or who will be transferred to Malaysia under this arrangements. We negotiated protections in relation to their human rights and we certainly negotiated protections in relation to caning and other human rights questions. But can I also say to the member that I understand that, for political reasons, the opposition will continue to dispute the government's arrangement with Malaysia. I understand that. I understand that the opposition will continue to do that, even though they have now had access to the same advice available to government. That advice has told them - and this cannot be denied; this truth cannot be twisted by the opposition - that the Malaysia arrangement has the best deterrence effect. That advice has told them that Malaysia is the best option. There is no twisting and turning that gets away from that. That advice is in front of the opposition.                 They may choose to walk away from that advice. They may choose, in the face of the best possible expert advice, to say: 'We choose the costly solution that won't work. We reject the solution that the experts say will work.' They may choose to send to people smugglers the message that says, 'Go to Nauru and you'll get a ticket to Australia.' They may choose to criticise the government as it sends a message that says, 'If you try to come to Australia, you'll go to Malaysia.' They may choose to play that wrecking politics. That is what we expect from this opposition. We expect them to act as a party of protest.                 But the question before this parliament is not whether they will continue to play reckless, negative politics - because we know they will. The question before this parliament is whether the words of the Leader of the Opposition can be relied on. He has said, and I quote his words -                      The opposition are always very keen to get into questions of honesty.                     The question of course can only be properly answered in this way: the government will be bringing legislation to this parliament to give executive government the power it needs to have offshore processing. We will be relying on the words of the Leader of the Opposition when he said:                 I think that our country should have the best border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I'm prepared to work constructively to give the Government, to restore to the Government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it.                 The real question before the member is whether she wants to join with the Leader of the Opposition in playing reckless politics or whether they want to act in the national interest and amend the legislation. The question is whether or not they are in any way serious about stopping the boats.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Two months ago the government released a plan for a clean energy future for Australia, and of course there has been considerable discussion of the plan since its release. It will ensure that Australia takes action to tackle climate change in the most economically efficient and environmentally effective manner. We developed this policy because the science on climate change is clear: climate change is occurring; human activity is contributing; and if it is left unchecked the Australian economy and our environment would be severely affected. No government acting responsibly can ignore that advice. A government must act, and this government has acted.                 A carbon price is the cheapest and most effective way to cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. It will create innovation. It will drive productivity improvements in our economy. It will reduce the emissions intensity of our economy. It will improve our long-term competitiveness. The carbon price will allow us to fulfil our obligation to future generations and to meet our responsibility to do a fair share to tackle climate change within and in partnership with the international community - and we must never lose sight of that responsibility as parliamentarians.                 We released draft legislation last month and we have received over 300 submissions in response. We will be introducing the legislation to this House tomorrow. We have been debating these issues for decades. There have in fact been no fewer than 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. So we have been debating this now for 17 years in our parliament. The time for inaction has passed. It is time for the parliament to take the practical steps to cut pollution and drive the investment that we need in clean energy and energy efficiency. It is extremely important for the business community, because business needs the certainty over climate change policy. Business needs the certainty of the carbon price mechanism and what the carbon price will be so that it can invest in long-lived assets, in particular in sectors like the energy generation sector.                 Notwithstanding all of the inquiries, all of the evidence, the science and the imperatives to act economically, the Leader of the Opposition opposes action on climate change. He attacks the scientists. He attacks the economists. He runs a baseless fear campaign in the community. He talks the economy down. He undermines consumer sentiment. He creates insecurity amongst working people about their jobs. He goes around terrifying pensioners. He makes false claims designed to frighten small business people, falsely claiming cost increases that will never materialise. The Leader of the Opposition should stop his baseless fear campaign and support an important reform.                     Let's not forget that John Howard, the former Prime Minister, supported a carbon price through emissions trading and took that policy to the last federal election that he contested, in 2007. Of course, in the last parliament, the government reached agreement with the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, about this policy issue. It has fundamentally been the destructive and opportunistic behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition that has impeded this parliament dealing with this issue - and deal with it we will.

  Isn't it interesting: the more advice the opposition get that Malaysia is the most effective deterrent, the more they are determined to undermine it. I suspect the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cook are worried that it will undermine their cheap slogan business model.                     Thank you, Mr Speaker. What we negotiated with the Malaysian government was a commitment to nonrefoulement, the fundamental principle of the refugee convention. What we negotiated is work rights for the people transferred. What we negotiated is that people will be treated with dignity and respect in accordance with human rights standards.                 The member for Cook knows this because he went on a little fact-finding mission to Malaysia. He went on a little trip and took a little home video, which was very thoughtful. He stood outside a detention centre and said, 'This is where people will be sent.' Wrong. He said, 'People wouldn't have work rights.' Wrong. He was proven wrong on every single point. The negotiations resulted in the arrangement as announced and as outlined.                     That was what was negotiated by the Australian government with the Malaysian government, in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, despite all of Morrison's myths. That is what was negotiated with the government - those protections for the people transferred. I think the government was more successful than the member for Cook would have been in his negotiations with President Ahmadinejad on his swap agreement with Iran.

  I thank the member for Moreton for a very important question. The top priority for this government is to build a strong economy that provides high-value, high-paid jobs to Australians. In the 21st century, those economies that will be successful, those first-class economies, will be those that are substantially driven by clean energy, and most particularly renewable energy. That is the importance of the package that we are putting before the Australian people. The clean energy package that we are putting forward will provide the certainty to invest.                     We are firing the starter's gun for the investment across a whole new lot of areas of innovation, particularly clean energy jobs, which will come across wide sectors of our economy.                 This initiative builds on what we have been doing so far. It builds on putting in place the NBN, another very important initiative to lift the productivity of our economy. It builds on the $3 billion package which was at the core of our recent budget to invest in the skills, education and training of our people. And, of course, it builds on what we are doing in taxation reform to make sure we give a tax break to those 2.7 million small businesses out there and to make a cut to the company tax rate.                 This is a fundamental reform and it is in the tradition of the other big fundamental reforms that have made the Australian economy much more resilient. As I was saying before, the Australian economy is resilient, and one of the reasons it has been resilient is that governments in the eighties and the nineties in this country put in place a raft of reforms that have built that underlying strength. This is one of those reforms - a reform that we need to stay ahead of the game, to get the investment going into clean energy technologies to create the jobs of the future. Under our clean energy package there will be 1.6 million jobs created over the period to 2020. They will come from very important projects such as our investment in solar power up in Chinchilla or at Moree - very important projects not just in terms of construction but in terms of how they will drive the innovation for the future. All of these projects are a small step but an important step in making sure that we grab the opportunities of the 21st century in clean energy, just as they are doing it in other countries right around the world - in Denmark, in Germany, in China and right around the region. We must make this reform so we are not left behind. What that really means is that decision makers have to front up to their responsibilities. They cannot ignore the facts. They cannot ignore the case for investing in clean energy through putting a price on carbon and the fact that it is the most efficient way to do that. Those on the other side of the House want to deny the facts. They want to put their heads in the sand. They want to reject the 21st century. They do not understand the importance of clean energy. We on this side of the House understand the importance of getting the economic settings right so we can be prosperous in the 21st century and deliver the high-value, high-paid jobs all Australians deserve.

  Of course, what we want to achieve is effective turnarounds. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition must know is that the people smugglers' business model has changed. They do not sit in the boats now enabling our Navy and patrol boat personnel to turn the boats around. There is not a way of going out to sea and turning the boats around and taking them to Indonesia, for two reasons. Reason No. 1: the transnational crime of people smuggling, like other transnational crimes, mutates in the way that it goes about its business, depending on enforcement techniques. Knowing that boats are at risk of being turned around, what happens now is that people disable boats. So you are left with a stark choice: do you leave people to drown at sea or do you go and pick them up? Well, we are Australian. We go and pick them up - of course we do. Then, of course, the attitude of Indonesia has changed. Indonesia does not take boat returns.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims some expertise in foreign affairs. I know the Leader of the Opposition doubts it and he is looking to the member for Kooyong to take her job, but she must know that Indonesia does not take boat returns any longer and she must understand the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition pretending that Indonesia will take boat returns, pretending that boats can be turned around and taken to a non refugee signatory country, with no protections negotiated. And then they come in here and bleat -                      I was asked about the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs about turning boats around and I am explaining the factual circumstances. I know the opposition does not like facts, but facts are important. We have heard bleating today about human rights issues - bleat, bleat, bleat from the opposition - when the policy that they went to the last election with was that the Leader of the Opposition would direct patrol boat commanders to take boats to Indonesia, not refugee signatories, and he would not have cared less what happened to them afterwards - men, women and children. To pretend that he did is absurd nonsense. The hypocrisy of this is truly remarkable. The shadow minister for immigration is on the record saying he does not care less about refugee signatory countries.                 So the answer to the deputy leader's question is this: I so much agree with the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that turning boats around is effective deterrence that I have worked with the minister for immigration in the modern circumstances where the crime of people smuggling has changed and where the attitude of Indonesia is different - I have worked with the minister for immigration to create a circumstance where, in effect, we are turning boats around - that is, people come here and they end up on a plane. It is the same process. They believe they are coming to Australia but they end up somewhere else. It is a virtual turnaround of boats. If the opposition had listened to the facts -                      And screaming abuse does not make the facts any different. I do not know when the opposition will ever learn that screaming abuse does not change the facts.                     The opposition was advised that turning the boats around in the past, when it was possible, did work as a deterrent. They were advised that in the modern age Malaysia is the best deterrent. Why do they come into this place and play cheap politics with national interest questions? That is what the Australian people are entitled an answer to. What a ridiculous -

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She knows that this government has been very active in supporting pensioners to make sure we can do everything possible to help them balance their budgets. Of course, we intend to support pensioners again by providing real and permanent increases to the pension as we put a price on carbon. By contrast, of course, this Leader of the Opposition is determined to do everything he possibly can to leave pensioners behind in his desperate scramble for the Lodge. Of course, we know it was this Leader of the Opposition in the previous Howard government that let the pension decline over 12 years that they were in government. It was this Leader of the Opposition, when he was a member of the Howard cabinet, who actually refused to increase the pension - refused and opposed a proposal to increase the pension that came before their cabinet. Now this Leader of the Opposition is proposing to leave pensioners behind yet again. He wants to claw back the pension increase that this government will deliver to pensioners as part of our carbon reforms. It was this Leader of the Opposition who, when asked at a doorstop in Perth whether he would claw back the pension increases that we are delivering, said, 'I make no apologies for saying 'yes'.' This Leader of the Opposition, as he wanders off, does not care two hoots about pensioners. He is the one who is going to claw back the pension increase that we intend to give to pensioners.                 Under our plan we intend to deliver an increase to 3.4 million Australian pensioners to make sure that they get the protection and increases they need in their pensions. Pensioners will actually get, through a new Clean Energy Advance, a lump-sum payment which the opposition intends to claw back - to take back - from pensioners. There will be an increase of $250 for single pensioners, which will be clawed back by the Leader of the Opposition, and an increase of $180 for each member of a couple, which of course will be clawed back by those opposite.                 Those opposite think it is a joke that pensioners are going to be frightened by their ridiculous behaviour here today. This government will deliver to pensioners. Those opposite will do what they always do, frighten pensioners and claw back the increases, which will then see pensioners go backwards.

We will make available a briefing on the legislation. What we now need is the opposition to absorb the facts and to stop pretending they do not exist.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. Indeed the world is acting on climate change, contrary to what those opposite have to say. On 15 July maritime countries agreed to the first ever shipping emissions regulations. Fifty-five of the world's biggest seafaring countries agreed at the International Maritime Organisation to reduce climate emissions from shipping with a global agreement to reduce energy use in new vessels from 2013 onwards. Of course, Australia as a founding member of the IMO was a key player in this action.                 This agreement represents the first ever mandatory global greenhouse gas reduction regime for an international industry sector. It is an international industry sector that has come together, regardless of nationality, to put in place an international regulatory regime to take action on climate change. The agreement will force all ships over 400 tonnes built after 2013 to improve their efficiency by 10 per cent, rising to 20 per cent between 2020 and 2024 and 30 per cent for ships delivered after 2024. This agreement is expected to lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions in shipping of 45 to 50 million tonnes a year by the year 2020. We know that there are economic productivity gains from good action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as is the case with shipping. There will be savings of some $5 billion a year by 2020, once again reinforcing this government's view that good environmental policy is also good economic policy.                 Shipping currently accounts for about three to four per cent of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide. This figure is expected to rise by six per cent by 2020, with emissions doubling by 2050 if no action is taken. It is consistent with this government's view, which is why we have also promoted a shipping policy that will support coastal shipping and support greater use of shipping as the most greenhouse-gas-efficient transport mode around our coast. This is another example of the government's good environmental policy. Taking action on climate change is consistent with international action and is good for jobs and good for our economy.

  I am not surprised we have ended up here. My answer to the member for Sturt is exactly the same as it was in the last sitting fortnight, when the opposition was out there trying to profit through smear and mud. I presume we will see it during this sitting fortnight as well. My answer in relation to matters that the member for Sturt refers to is there is a Fair Work Australia investigation in progress. That proper process should work through to its conclusion. I will continue to take that view consistently about Labor members in this parliament and about Liberal members in this parliament. Of course, the member for Sturt, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally are stuck in hypocrisy on this question.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for the question. During the parliamentary break over the last fortnight I was able on behalf of the government to sign off on the largest ever National Heritage listing on land in the West Kimberley. What we have done there has been consistent with a long legacy of environmental protection, whether it be going back to the Franklin River, Kakadu National Park or the Daintree Rainforest. In the Kimberley with the National Heritage listing we have some of the most spectacular parts of our continent: the Buccaneer Archipelago, with some of the highest tides in the world - there were 11-metre tides on the day I was there - where waterfalls are formed between the islands simply at the change of tide each day; the magnificent gorges in that great pathway along the Gibb River Road; and the Mighty Fitzroy River. For 200 kilometres, stretching alongside that West Kimberley coast, we have the most extraordinary trail of dinosaur footprints. We have an internationally regarded, extraordinary trail of dinosaur footprints which go to a level of heritage not found elsewhere on the continent.                 There are great stories of Indigenous cultural heritage: as well as the battle at Noonkanbah Station and Jandamarra, we also have the extraordinary story there of Fossil Downs Station and the pastoral industry, the largest overland droving expedition in the history of the nation. Unsurprisingly, when environmental outcomes of this nature are happening, they met with an objection from the Liberal premier. Forgetting that this originated from an agreement with the WA government - that was how it all started - we had objections from the Liberal premier claiming that we were going to jeopardise petrol stations, towns, camps, rubbish tips and bottle shops with a heritage listing. I make clear, in case the WA government has not caught up with it, that no garbage tips and no bottle shops or petrol stations were heritage listed. But some of the most extraordinary and special parts of Australian history and Australia's heritage formed part of that heritage listing.                 A heritage listing of itself is not a lockup - it does not mean that development cannot occur. But it does mean that, when development does occur, it has to take account of the values which have formed part of that listing. Across the 19 million hectares of the West Kimberley there are values which should properly be borne in mind in any future development applications. It does mean that the aspirations of some, including the WA Premier, who have talked about Broome becoming a future Dubai, will not see wholesale development throughout the Kimberley. It does mean that the area will not be wrecked. It does mean that the Kimberley will not - and the WA Premier has suggested that this would be a good thing - end up looking like the Pilbara. But it does mean that, within the West Kimberley, the values that should be protected will be protected.                 Just as when we protected the Franklin, the Liberals opposed it; just as when we protected Kakadu, the Liberals opposed it; just as when we protected the Daintree Rainforest, the Liberals opposed it; so, too, when we protect the West Kimberley, the Liberal premier opposes it. When the Libs win, the pathway is the same: the environment always loses. Whether you are looking at the national parks at the moment, where they are trying to turn them into cattle farms or turn the river red gum forests into places that are simply there for the collection of firewood, the pathway is the same. Good environmental outcomes only come when government is on the Labor side of the House.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, what the government has done is work through a new and innovative solution - that is, the Malaysia agreement - a transfer agreement, not something done under the Howard government, but something that according to the best possible advice that we have received is the strongest deterrent available to us now.                      To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: it is important that the Leader of the Opposition and the members of his front bench who are interjecting now absorb the facts of what is happening with people smuggling and asylum seekers. I know the word 'facts' always causes the opposition to guffaw because actually absorbing and understanding the facts is never their strong suit.                  But the facts are these: we have the clearest possible advice from the same experts who advised the Howard government that the strongest deterrence message we can send now is the agreement with Malaysia. We have the clearest possible advice to that effect. We have the clearest possible advice that having offshore processing on Nauru without having other measures like the Malaysia agreement would not have the deterrence value that we seek. We have the clearest possible advice to that effect. But I understand, that in this parliament and beyond, it will be controversial between the government and the opposition as to whether the best solution for people-smuggling issues is to have the Malaysia transfer arrangement or to have processing on Nauru.                  The government will maintain, standing on the basis of the best possible advice available to us, that we should implement the Malaysia arrangement. I expect the Leader of the Opposition to maintain that he opposes the arrangement with Malaysia and he seeks to have processing on Nauru. That debate will continue, but the issue that will come before the parliament and the issue that needs to be determined is whether or not executive government, any executive government, should have the power and authority it needs in order to put in place and beyond legal doubt offshore processing measures. I will be seeking to amend the Migration Act so that that legal authority is there. We will use that legal authority to implement the arrangement with Malaysia and to have a processing centre in Nauru. I fully understand if the Leader of the Opposition were ever elected Prime Minister of this country he would use that power in order to have processing on Nauru.                     Sorry, Malaysia and PNG. The Leader of the Opposition supports processing in Nauru.                      They are always on the substance and the issues of big principle, Mr Speaker!                 And so the question that the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer is not whether he agrees with the government about Malaysia and PNG -                      The question he needs to answer is whether he will support legislative amendments that enable executive government to make decisions about offshore processing. We await his answer, and I hope he answers that question not in the spirit of the interjections today but in the national interest.

  I think it is truly disappointing that this announcement cannot be met with support from both sides of the House. It is truly disappointing that that cannot happen - that partisanship and bitterness have so overtaken the opposition that they are unable to welcome a visit to this country by the President of the United States. But I am in the happy position -                      Thank you very much. I am in the happy position to confirm that President Obama will visit Australia on 16 and 17 November. I welcome that, the government welcomes that and, I believe, the Australian people will welcome that. President Obama's visit will come immediately after he chairs the APEC meeting in Honolulu, and it will occur just before he proceeds to the meeting of the expanded East Asia Summit in Indonesia. I believe he will enjoy a warm welcome here.                 When I had the opportunity to speak to President Obama earlier this year, I of course renewed Australia's invitation for him to visit. I said to him he would be welcome any time he was able to visit our country. He indicated to me that he was looking forward to visiting - he was looking forward to doing that because of the shared objectives that our countries have but also because he has very fond personal recollections of Australia from his visits here when he was a child. So we will be welcoming President Obama.                 In terms of the objectives of the visit, it could not come at a better time given we will be proceeding to the East -                      Thank you very much. I am used to it; there is nothing in this nation's interests that the opposition will not seek to trash. The visit could not come at a better time because we will be proceeding to the East Asia Summit, an important piece of regional architecture, and President Obama will be attending it for the first time. It could not come at a better time because we do have the 60th anniversary of our alliance to celebrate and commemorate. It could not come at a better time because it is 10 years since 9/11, something that I believe Australians marked and reflected upon over the weekend. To have President Obama here 10 years on is very important. It could not come at a better time because we continue to see instability in global markets and we will be working towards the G20 and looking forward to discussions at the G20 to consolidate global growth. It could not come at a better time because our nations are working in discussions as the United States works through its global force posture review. It could not come at a better time because we do have the important issue of transition in Afghanistan, where our soldiers fight today, to discuss together.                 I trust that when we receive President Obama it will be done genuinely by this parliament in a spirit of bipartisanship. I am disgusted it has got off to such a ridiculous start.

  I thank the member for Deakin for that very important question, because tackling dangerous climate change is one of those fundamental economic and environmental reforms for our nation but most particularly for the jobs of the future. This year Australia is experiencing its 20th year of continuous economic growth. One of the reasons why we saw in the last national accounts that there was a resilience in the Australian economy, despite all of the headwinds we can see in the international economy, is that governments in this country, over the past 25 years, have fronted up and dealt with the fundamental economic reforms that are required to strengthen our economy and to meet the challenges of the future. That is why everyone on this side of the House is so proud of the clean energy package introduced into the House today - because this is all about the jobs of the future. We on this side of the House understand that in the 21st century you cannot hope to be a first-rate economy unless you are powered by cleaner energy, particularly renewable energy. That is why we need a price on carbon.                 We on this side of the House accept the fact and accept the evidence that a price on carbon is the cheapest and most efficient way of driving that investment in cleaner energy and in renewable energy, because we will face up to the future. We will not turn our backs on the 21st century like those opposite. We understand the need to drive fundamental reform in our economy. If you look at the modelling that has been done you will see that it forecasts 1.6 million jobs through to 2020 in our economy, building on the nearly three-quarters of a million jobs that have been created. But those opposite are carrying on. They are dismissive of the importance of employment and they are dismissive of the importance of fundamental economic reform to drive the jobs of the future.                 This government has a reform agenda when it comes to coping with the big changes that are going on in our global economy - the movement from West to East in the global economy, and the mining boom. That is why we are investing in skills and education; it is why we are putting in place the NBN; and it is why we understand that we need to put a price on carbon, like so many other countries around the world. It is also why we understand the need to spread the opportunities that come from these fundamental reforms.                 That is why the Household Assistance Package that has been introduced in the House today is so important. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Of course, all of this assistance to households will be simply clawed back by those opposite, as the minister was explaining in this House yesterday, because those opposite do not understand the importance of fronting up to fundamental reform and taking the people with them, nor do they understand the importance of fundamental tax reform. At the core of this package is the proposal to lift the tax-free threshold - to triple it to $18,000. This is a fundamental reform that recognises the hard work of so many people on low incomes, and in particular the importance of secondary income earners.                 So what we on this side of the House are going to do is charge the large polluters and provide assistance to households and industry. Those on that side of the House are going to tax households $1,300 and hand it to the big polluters. That is just another one of their crazy policy propositions, which shows just how unfit for high office they all are.

  I was anticipating a question on the science of climate change but the member has chosen to ask me about something else. Can I say to the member, the issue for the parliament now is whether you believe executive government should have the power to engage in offshore processing - yes or no? That is the question.                     I am very prepared to speak about advice on the question of Nauru. The advice we have received and made available to the opposition is it will not work. The advice we have received is that the Migration Act needs amending. What we are waiting to hear from the opposition is whether they will join with the government in doing that.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. It is a very serious one and I am sure all members of the parliament will have an interest in the answer. We are all committed in this parliament, this government, all Australian governments, to remembering and honouring our war dead. It is one of the things that has bound us together as a nation over a very long period of time. It is part of the contract between our nation and those who have served for us in battle. It is a commitment that I take very seriously.                 The treaties that Australia and the Commonwealth have with France relating to our war dead are amongst the strongest treaties of their kind. French and Belgian officials and those who own and farm the land in which remains are sometimes found understand the desire of Australians to ensure that any remains are dealt with sensitively and they share our concern about treating our war dead with respect.                 I am advised that there is no evidence that French farmers are guilty of ploughing human remains back into their fields, as has sometimes been asserted in media reporting. In recent years most if not all remains of Australian soldiers have been discovered at a depth greater than that which is uncovered by routine ploughing. They are further underground. In almost every instance those remains were discovered during deeper excavations - for example, when people are digging trenches for gas pipelines, so they are working further underground.                 As all Australians know, tens of thousands of Australians fell in battle across the Western Front. There are about 18,000 Australians who lost their lives and for whom there is no known grave. The government will continue to do all it can to find and identify the remains of our war dead. The member for Denison referred to Fromelles, for example. We continue to identify and commemorate the remains of 250 soldiers. Those remains were discovered in 2009. The government has set up a new unit known as the Unrecovered War Casualties section to specifically investigate missing-in-action cases.                  Finally, I want to recognise - and I think members of the House would join me in this - the respect and gratitude and constant acts of remembrance that the people of France and Belgium pay to Australia. People who have visited there comment on it, not only in terms of the memorials they see but also in the attitudes of the people they meet. We continue to be grateful for seeing that emotion from the people of France and the people in Belgium towards our soldiers lost at war.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I was very pleased earlier today to introduce into this parliament, alongside the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the legislation to put a price on carbon and realise a clean energy future.                   An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In seizing this clean energy future we will always be guided by the science and we will always be guided by the facts. The scientists are telling us - and we accept the science - our climate is changing. That change is caused by human induced carbon pollution and we need to act to reduce that carbon pollution. I know on the other side of the parliament they deny the science. We do not; we accept the science. And we accept the advice of economists that the cheapest way of reducing carbon pollution is to put a price on that carbon pollution, to ask the big polluters to pay. The legislation we have brought before the parliament will do just that.                 In asking the big polluters to pay, we recognise that innovative Australian business people who have a price on carbon pollution will innovate and change the way that they do business. They would work to reduce the price they pay for carbon pollution by reducing that carbon pollution itself. They will introduce new ways of working. We have innovative business people in our nation and we will see them respond and adapt as we put a price on carbon. This is a price that the biggest polluters pay and the revenue raised from that price will be used to protect Australian jobs, to ensure that we look after Australian households and to make sure that we innovate and seize a clean energy future.                 There is nothing more important to this government than people having jobs. We cannot afford to have our nation left behind as the rest of the world moves to seizing a clean energy future. By putting the price on carbon we will seize that clean energy future, we will seize those clean energy jobs. We will also work with Australian households and families and with pensioners to make sure that we are assisting them with the flow-through impacts of asking the biggest polluters to pay a price on carbon pollution.                 I am very proud that we have been able to associate with putting a price on carbon a major tax reform which will better value work, will send a clearer signal about the benefits of work and will send a clearer signal about moving from welfare to work, which will enable low-income Australians to see the benefits of the work that they do.                 We will always be guided by the science and the facts. I know that the opposition are taking a different approach. They have distributed this document of deceit to get their members out there telling Australians things that are not the truth. They are about fear, not facts. They are about slogans, not substance. We will deliver the change this nation needs for a clean energy future, for clean energy jobs, as the Leader of the Opposition continues his campaign of deceit.

  I thank the member for his question. I claim it on the basis of expert advice, but I do not ask the member to agree with me on that. That is not the point, and no amount of screaming and shouting by the opposition frontbench will change this fundamental fact. I do not ask the member who has asked the question, the member for Bonner, to agree with me on that; I do not ask him to accept the expert advice. I understand that the opposition is in a mode in the modern age where it trashes the view of every expert - scientists knocked aside, economists knocked aside, senior public servants treated with disrespect. I understand that is the present attitude of the opposition.                 That is as it may be, and the opposition may choose to pursue a solution about people smuggling that is not recommended on the basis of expert advice. That is a matter for it. What is squarely before the member who asked the question and squarely before the Leader of the Opposition is not endorsing the government's arrangement with Malaysia - I do not seek that; I do not expect that. What I do expect is the opposition to join with the government to amend the Migration Act to put beyond legal doubt the ability of executive government to have processing offshore. That is what I expect.                 In pursuit of that objective we have made briefings and advice available to the Leader of the Opposition from senior public servants. He has marched out the door and he has deliberately misconstrued what he has been told. We have made available to the Leader of the Opposition the advice of the Solicitor-General. He has misconstrued that in the parliament today. But, despite all of that, we will continue to provide advice and information to the Leader of the Opposition and we are specifically offering a briefing on the proposed legislation.                 At some point the opposition is going to have to stop this kind of carry-on in question time and actually answer what in truth is a very simple question: will you vote for changes to the Migration Act that empower executive government to act and to implement its preferred solution and its preferred offshore processing arrangements? Will you do that? Won't you do that? No amount of carry-on in question time is going to get you away from that decision. That decision has to be made. And when it is made I trust that the Leader of the Opposition spends some time reflecting on the national interest rather than his narrow political interest, because most days the Leader of the Opposition can be negative and reckless without consequence but this is not one of those occasions. This is an occasion where negativity and recklessness would have a cost for our country.                     Our country should not have to pay that cost.                     The Leader of the Opposition should instruct members of the Liberal Party and the National Party to vote in favour of this legislation and to vote in favour of the national interest, just for once.

  Today I was very pleased to be able to support the Prime Minister in introducing the carbon price legislation. Eighteen bills were introduced prior to question time in what is one of the most important economic and environmental reforms undertaken in the country. It is the culmination of a debate that has been running for the better part of two decades. We have seen 35 parliamentary inquiries into climate change since 1994. Indeed, there has been a lot of discussion on this issue in this House. Even during this year alone there have been around 250 questions asked on carbon pricing and over 15 separate MPI debates. The fact of the matter is that the time to act is now. There has been lengthy debate, lengthy inquiry, lengthy argument, the policy has been developed, there has been lengthy consultation -                      The fact is that it is imperative that we begin the transformation of our economy in this way. This transformation will begin with the passage of the clean energy legislation. We need to put in place the incentives for business to invest in clean energy technologies that will allow Australia to maintain its economic growth at the same time as it cuts its pollution. The countries that pioneer the clean technologies of the future will be those that achieve this change and they are the countries that will see strong and consistent economic growth through the next century. They are the economies that will have the competitive edge.                 The alternative to this is the Leader of the Opposition's prescription, his position of saying 'no' and doing nothing about it. It is pretending that climate change is not occurring. It is attacking the scientists, who say that climate change is occurring. It is attacking the economists, who state that a carbon price is the most efficient way of tackling this problem. By refusing to grapple with the challenges and the opportunities of a carbon constrained world, the Leader of the Opposition would rather see our economy become stagnant and fall behind our competitors.                 This morning I had the opportunity to meet with a number of experts in the climate change and emissions trading fields who are visiting this country, including representatives from China, India, Denmark, and the United States, and in particular the state of California. Emissions trading will start next year in California - an economy larger than our own. China is on track to pilot six emissions trading schemes from 2013 covering 230 million people and a combined gross domestic product of more than US$1,500 billion. These are extremely important developments in the Asia-Pacific region and Australia must be part of it.                 A transition to a low-carbon economy is inevitable. The only question is whether we do it in a steady gradual manner that will see tax cuts and protection for jobs, as will occur with the passage of the clean energy legislation, or whether it will be forced upon our economy by external circumstances at far greater cost and with a far more difficult adjustment. The relentless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition would condemn the Australian economy to a much more painful, much more sudden, much more costly shift to a low-carbon economy. It is imperative this parliament carries this legislation.

  Indeed, prior to question time, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs introduced legislation into this parliament to ensure that Australia could move to a clean energy future. We have done that in a way which is transparent. We gave notice of it a week ago. We gave notice yesterday of the process that would be proceeded with, and there are motions on notice that will be considered this afternoon in order to facilitate that process.                  We have indicated that discussion on the legislation will begin tomorrow. Tomorrow, it is the first item and we will go through all of this week and all of next week. We have said that we are prepared to sit extra hours, an offer that at this stage is being opposed by those opposite. They say that we do not have enough time to debate the bills but they are opposed to sitting extra hours. I indicate to the House that we will be bringing forward resolutions to the House that will facilitate extra hours, and those opposite, if they wish to oppose them, can do so. But they certainly cannot have it both ways, and the Manager of Opposition Business confirms his hypocrisy by saying that they will oppose these bills.                 We have given one month's notice until the votes will be determined finally on 12 October - one month. This compares with eight days that they gave for the Work Choices legislation, where member after member, including me, was excluded from participating in that debate. Indeed, we had an exposure draft of the bills released on 28 July, with 300 submissions received. The MPCCC had 1,300 submissions received. There have been 35 parliamentary reviews in 19 years and a range of expert reviews, including the Shergold review, the Garnaut review, and the CPRS green and white papers. So we have had a lot of debate. But it is now time to decide. Do we go forward into the future to a clean energy future, or not?                 Of course we know that those opposite have one tactic, which is to oppose. Those opposite have one tactic, which is to destroy everything that they touch. Today we have seen their behaviour in this House, which is one thing. But it has moved up another step. Some of those who have been escorted out of the gallery had lunch with a number of the members prior to today. The members opposite are now not just inciting their backbench; they are inciting the gallery with their little people's revolt.                     There is no decency from those opposite. I notice that the member for Indi is not here. She is probably outside my office, as she was two weeks ago with the banner 'Tolerance is our Demise'. All the outrageous slogans and activities that were there were flown up at taxpayers' expense in order to engage in that sort of grubby behaviour.                 This government is determined to provide every opportunity to have debate. We are not frightened of a debate about ideas. We know that on the science, we will listen to the scientists; on the economics, we will listen to the economists; and we know what those opposite have said about the carbon tax. The Leader of the Opposition says that if it comes in, 'take it off and resist to the death this thing coming in'. That is their position. They say they want more time, but how much time does it take to say no, no, no!

  The government understands that, despite the Australian economy being the envy of the world, there are some families who are feeling the pinch and, though parents want a low-pollution future for their kids and grandkids, they need to balance the family budget today. That is why, while we are talking about our clean energy future, we are also talking about household assistance that will be available for Australian families.                 Just as age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers and others will receive household assistance, so too will families who are receiving family payments. For those families, carbon price assistance will be paid as a separate supplement through Centrelink. Eligible recipients will not have to fill in any forms; they are going to get that benefit automatically into the bank account, the same way the family payments are paid. Our household assistance package will ensure that families have that money in their pockets before the carbon price takes effect. Every family payment recipient will receive some or all of their first year's assistance up-front through a lump-sum payment, the clean energy advance. This advance will be paid by Centrelink between May and June next year, before the carbon price is implemented on 1 July 2012.                 On top of that, every taxpayer earning under $80,000 a year will get a tax cut from 1 July next year. So in the electorate of Corangamite, 50,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut and more than 40,000 people will receive additional income support or family assistance payments. What that means for a typical family - say, mum, dad, and three children aged four, seven and nine - is that if dad is earning $52Â½ thousand a year and mum is working part time and earning $17Â½ thousand a year, a total of $75,000 a year, the family will get $332 extra in government payments and $982 as a tax cut. So, in total, that family receives around $1,300 a year extra. That is $700 a year on top of any expected price impact on that family. That $700 a year extra can go towards buying energy efficient appliances, just as an example of something that family could do to further lessen any price impacts on them. That is a very stark contrast to those opposite, who not only want to claw back that $1,300 of assistance, not only want to rip back that tax cut and those family assistance increases, but actually want to slug that family an extra $1,300 a year to subsidise big polluters. They want to take money from that family - tax dollars that could be used on education, health, training, roads or whatever it may be - and subsidise the big polluters.                 We have a month of debate ahead of us. Nobody really believes that the Leader of the Opposition needs a month to make up his mind. We know that he has already made up his mind and that what is coming is a big fat no on this. In fact, that is why people have started calling the Leader of the Opposition the minus sign of Australian politics - whenever you put him into the equation, the result is a negative.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. When debating matters of national importance, such as carbon pricing and tackling climate change, it is important that governments and oppositions take account of the facts and base their argument on those and the evidence, not on fear. Since the government announced a framework for a carbon-pricing mechanism, the government has methodically undertaken analysis and modelling, presented evidence, prepared reports and consulted with stakeholders - all of which has shown that a carbon price is the most economically efficient and environmentally effective way of cutting pollution. In contrast, those opposite and their state colleagues in fact have mounted a political campaign that has been based on misrepresentation, misinformation and deceit, aimed at only one thing - inciting unfounded fear in the community about this issue.                 An article in today's Sydney Morning Herald reveals that, rather than engaging genuinely on climate change, those opposite have been told to parrot a series of untruths and distortions from this document: 'Carbon tax legislation talking points', which has been distributed amongst the opposition. They have been handed those talking points. I have looked through them and they are a classic exercise in deception. They claim, for example, that the government's modelling of the impact of a carbon price on families and on pensioners used a carbon price of $20 a tonne, not $23 a tonne, which is the starting price for the scheme. That is a lie, and they know it is a lie.                     I withdraw, but it is clearly deceit because the modelling of the impact of a carbon price on households and on pensioners used a $23 carbon price, and that is well known. The talking points circulated by the opposition also claim that there will be 126,000 jobs lost as a result of a carbon price. That is another exercise in deceit. The Treasury modelling demonstrates clearly that there will be growth of 1.6 million jobs to the year 2020 under carbon pricing.                 The coalition's talking points also claim the government will spend $3.5 billion in taxpayers' funds to buy international carbon credits in the year 2020. That is a disgracefully misleading claim designed to foster the protectionist xenophobia that the Leader of the Opposition traffics in. The blatant misinformation does not stop there. It extends to the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell. He too has been caught out deliberately exaggerating the impact of a carbon price on public transport. Premier O'Farrell claimed not so long ago that public transport fares would increase by around 3.6 per cent. Now that we have access to the real New South Wales documents we find that his own modelling states that the impact will be less than 0.5 per cent.                 All that the Liberal Party and the National Party are prepared to engage in on this fundamental issue of economic and environmental reform is misinformation and deceit. It is time that the parliament passes this legislation and implements this important reform. The Australian people will see through the deception on the other side of this House.

 I thank the shadow minister for his question. No. 1 - and I think this is very important because it was clear to me even as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was delivering his answer that there is confusion about this on the opposition front bench - the modelling of the household impacts and the government's household assistance package is based on a $23 starting price.                     The shadow Treasurer did not seem to understand that before, so I did want to clarify that.                     I am clarifying this because it appeared to me that the shadow Treasurer was confused. The household assistance package is modelled on a $23 starting price. Yes, the Treasury modelling of the macroeconomic indicators is based on a $20 starting carbon price. As the shadow minister has indicated, the government is having the modelling updated -                      In answer to the shadow minister's question, the updated modelling will be available next week well before the parliament votes on this legislation. Let's be frank, the updated modelling will not change anybody's mind in the opposition because they are not interested in the facts.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. It brings us to a matter that was the subject of discussion a little earlier on in question time. This is a matter that is very important to the national interest and a matter in which it is very important that this parliament and every member within it proceeds understanding the facts.                 The facts are these: after the High Court case of recent weeks, the government has received legal advice from the Solicitor-General which deals with the outcome of the High Court case and makes it abundantly clear that for executive government - for this government; for any government in the future - to have the power beyond legal doubt to process or transfer asylum seekers to countries outside Australia, the Migration Act needs amending. It is the intention of the government to bring to the parliament amendments to the Migration Act that achieve that. They will not be country specific. They will enable executive government - this executive government; any executive government in the future - to implement the decision it believes is best in the national interest.                 I understand that there is a sharp difference of opinion between the government and the opposition on what should be done based on that kind of power. The government is committed to the arrangement we struck with Malaysia and to a complementary centre in PNG. The opposition has a different view. It has a view about Nauru. Clearly, in question time a little bit earlier we were contesting those two policies and the merits and advice that leads to them. The government maintains that the expert advice leads it to the Malaysia arrangement as having the best deterrence value. Of course the opposition is at complete liberty to take a different view even when they have received expert advice. If they make a determination that policy is different, that is a matter for them. But we are asking the opposition in the national interest to step forward and work with the government to amend the Migration Act so that executive government - this executive government; any executive government of this nation in the future - has the power that it will need to transfer asylum seekers to third countries.                 Members of the parliament may have seen an exchange between me and the Leader of the Opposition following a discussion of these questions. The Leader of the Opposition said to me: 'Do you really expect me to accept an invitation couched in these terms? All I get is bile from you.' That was what the Leader of the Opposition said to me. Let me make it absolutely transparent to this parliament - and I believe it needs to be on the public record - that, yes, I do expect the Leader of the Opposition to accept an invitation couched in these terms because it is in the national interest. I do not expect the Leader of the Opposition to allow his tender feelings to interrupt a proper consideration of the national interest. If the Leader of the Opposition has problems with statements made by me, well, poor petal, but we will have a political contest about those. What should not happen is that this nation's national interest is held hostage to the monstrous arrogance of the Leader of the Opposition. He should work with the government to amend the Migration Act. That is in the national interest and he should get it done.

  I thank the member for his question. As he is probably aware, in the United States various states are taking their own actions in relation to climate change, at the same time that President Obama is driving a very ambitious clean energy agenda. What that should cause the member to reflect on is whether it will be this country that has the clean energy jobs of the future or whether it will be other nations. I am for having the jobs in this country. That is why we are moving for a clean energy future.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. The House is well aware of the High Court judgment on 31 August, which changed what was well accepted and understood on both sides of the House as to the interpretation of the changes to the Migration Act which the member for Berowra introduced in 2001. The clear understanding, until that High Court decision, was that they enabled the minister for immigration of the day to nominate a country for third-party processing, where the minister had made a determination that the protections in place were appropriate. Under that legislation, a declaration was made for Nauru and for Papua New Guinea by the former minister, the member for Berowra, which, until very recently, was held to still be in force and still be valid.                 The strong legal consensus, at least amongst anybody who does not have the name 'George Brandis', is that not only did the High Court judgment rule out the Malaysia arrangement but also that the declarations made by the honourable member should now also be regarded as being invalid. We have had five Senior Counsel or Queen's Counsel provide written advice to that effect: Gagaler SC, Lloyd SC, Kennett SC, Estcourt QC and Merkel QC. Merkel QC, for example, said: 'In respect of both Nauru and PNG, there must be great doubt that a declaration by the minister would be valid.' From Stephen Estcourt QC: 'Any declaration of Nauru or Papua New Guinea under section 198A(3) would, notwithstanding the obvious point of distinction, likely meet the same fate as the recently invalidated declaration in respect to Malaysia.' Or we have the international law expert Professor Don Rothwell, who said:                   _ offshore processing in Malaysia, as per the High Court's decision, and in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, would not be legally permissible.                 But it seems that, not content with ignoring climate scientists and not content with ignoring economists, alone they are now ignoring the lawyers as well. We have had the member for Cook denying that legislation will be necessary for a processing centre at Nauru.                 They seem to base this on the advice of Senator Brandis, the Liberal Party's spokesman on legal issues, who sits in his office, stroking his chin, saying, 'Should I advise that Liberal Party policy is legal or illegal as shadow Attorney-General? As the Liberal Party spokesman on legal matters, should I say the Liberal Party would be in breach of the law or not?' He weighs these matters up very carefully, I am sure. But, clearly, if the Liberal Party are to be regarded as fair dinkum, they will accept the consensus of legal opinion, just as they will accept the consensus of opinion on the effectiveness of Nauru.                 Earlier in question time, we had the member for Tangney talking about an FOI request released as recently as six months ago - they were right on to it, as quick as a flash. What the member for Tangney did not quote was another segment of that FOI, which said:                   _ the vast majority of those who arrived at excised offshore places and who were found to be refugees were settled in Australia or New Zealand.                 That is direct advice from the department of immigration which confirms the advice that has been given to this government consistently, which the Prime Minister referred to yesterday. Over 90 per cent of those resettled from Nauru were resettled in Australia or New Zealand. The Leader of the Opposition may claim that being sent to New Zealand is a deterrent, but I am going to defend New Zealand. It is not a deterrent for people to arrive in New Zealand by boat; what it does show is that their policy continues to be a failure. They should act in the national interest and work with the government. This is a test for the Leader of the Opposition: will he act in the national interest or in his own cheap political interest?

  The government has negotiated an arrangement with Malaysia in good faith and we will honour that arrangement and the government of Malaysia will honour that arrangement. To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: very simply, I do not expect him to endorse the government's arrangement with Malaysia. That is not the question before the parliament. The executive government will make decisions about asylum seeker processing. Legislative amendments will come before this parliament next week. What needs to be addressed before this parliament is ensuring that executive government, this government, any government, has the legislative authority that it needs to make the decisions it sees best in relation to the processing and transfer of asylum seekers. A little earlier today I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition -                      As I was saying, a little earlier today I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition and advised him that the government would ensure that relevant officials, including the Solicitor-General, were able on Friday to brief him on the legislative amendments. I trust that he will take that briefing. I know that he has been looking for one, so I am sure that something can be organised that suits his convenience.                 The important fact here is having the legislation in the right form to enable government to make the decisions that it wants to in relation to the processing and transfer of asylum seekers. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition does not view favourably the government's arrangement with Malaysia. I believe the government of Malaysia will honour the obligations it has freely taken upon itself. The Leader of the Opposition may well form a different view about the merits of the Malaysia arrangement, but there is only one question that will come before this parliament and that question will be the amendments to the Migration Act. I will be asking the Leader of the Opposition to deal with those amendments in the national interest.

 I thank the member for Greenway for her question. It is an important question about national policy and the things that are most important to Australian families. Of course, the thing most important to Australians is having the benefits and dignity of work and we are determined to keep our economy strong because we know that people must be able to get access to a job. There can be no security for Australian families or Australian individuals if they cannot access a job.                 That is why we worked so strongly and so hard during the days of the global financial crisis to ensure that this nation did not go into recession and to protect the jobs of 200,000 Australians to make sure that Australians had the benefits and dignity of work. Having looked after those jobs during the days of the global financial crisis, continuing to strengthen and modernise our economy is an ongoing task. That work is never finished. You need to keep strengthening, keep modernising in our world of change. That is why the government has been so determined to ensure that, in this phase of economic transformation - as we see in our economy an incredibly strong resources sector, record terms of trade and a high Australian dollar, with the implications that has, some of them positive, and the implications that also has for trade exposed areas of our economy like manufacturing, tourism and international education - we are doing the things necessary to keep our economy strong for the future.                 You cannot hide from the future. You cannot wish it away. There are only two choices: either you step up and shape it or it shapes you. I am determined that our nation will make the decisions necessary to make sure that we are the shapers of our future and, in shaping our future, we will be continuing to deliver policies that modernise our economy. In delivering those policies we will be focused on the importance of skills, education and human capital and on the importance of traditional infrastructure like roads and rail and ports. Of course, we will also be focused on the infrastructure of the future, including the National Broadband Network and the microeconomic reform agenda that needs to come with that, with the structural separation of Telstra. Of course, there will also be a focus on the clean energy jobs of the future.                 Yesterday it was my very great honour to bring to this parliament the Clean Energy Bill -                      I was talking about Australian jobs, and as I do that I expect the opposition to be focused on abusing me because they have no care or concern about the employment of Australians. We have a Leader of the Opposition who slept through the legislation to support the jobs of Australians during the global financial crisis - who was so unconcerned about Australian jobs that he stayed asleep.                 Yesterday I introduced in this parliament the legislation to get us the clean energy jobs of the future. This is an important national debate. I attended to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's speech this morning. I would have to say I was dismayed that he devoted only one sentence to his policy alternative. I think that is saying something about the opposition's perspective. To the clean energy jobs of the future they just say no, because for them it is always about fear and never about facts.

  In answer to the shadow minister's question I will repeat what I have said already in question time today and what I had cause to say yesterday. I understand that there are sharply divided views in this parliament about refugee and asylum seeker policy. I understand that. Indeed, our nation has lived with that for many long years - with sharply divided views on a number of these questions - and I suspect we will live with sharply divided views both in this place and in the community broadly for many long years to come.                 Against that backdrop of community division and different views both within this parliament and beyond, government needs to address the task and always have in its mind what is best in our national interest to secure our borders and to ensure that we meet the obligations we have voluntarily accepted under the refugee convention. The government has made a set of decisions about that. I understand the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with those decisions and I do not ask him to. But I do ask him to join with the government in putting executive government in the legal position it believed itself to be in before the recent High Court case. That is the legal position the Howard government also believed itself to be in. That is the question before this parliament -                      What I say to the member for Cook is that the question that we will present to this parliament is the question about legislative power. I remain determined to amend the Migration Act. The question does present squarely to the opposition whether it will join the government in that. We have made briefings available. We are in the process now of arranging a briefing for the Leader of the Opposition. I trust that the opposition, when it has received that briefing about the amendments, will reach the view that it is important that there is legislation in the right form to enable government to enact its preferred answer on refugee and asylum seeker policy. For us, that will be Malaysia and PNG. For the opposition, that will be Nauru. But we require legislative amendment to support either solution, so the briefing will be made available. I ask the member for Cook and the Leader of the Opposition to absorb that information and make the decisions in their shadow cabinet and their party rooms beyond in the interests of this nation.                 Leave not granted.

  I would like to thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The clean-energy package of bills that were introduced by the government yesterday will responsibly transform our economy over time. They will establish an emissions trading scheme that will cut our pollution and generate large and ongoing investments in clean energy and in energy efficiency.                 Our economy and our workforce will continue to grow while we are cutting pollution under the arrangements that the bills will put in place. By providing certainty for investors, in particular, over carbon pricing, the package will unleash a wave of investment in clean energy generation and clean technology innovation. Industry will invest to reduce the emissions intensity of their production processes, and many businesses are already planning that investment. That investment and improvement in emissions intensity of our businesses is critical to productivity growth in our economy over time and it is the keystone of future prosperity, because productivity growth is absolutely critical to the improvement of living standards in our society in the future.                 The package also includes very important changes to the income tax system. It includes income tax cuts that are achieved by trebling the income-tax-free threshold. That measure will boost workforce participation because it generates incentives for people to work. This is an economic reform important to the country's future that has the double dividend of boosting productivity and improving workforce participation.                 By contrast, pretty much all that we know about the position of the opposition is that they have brought forward a subsidies-for-polluters scheme that will cost Australian families and taxpayers $48 billion to 2020, or $1,300 per household per annum by 2020. The Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity today to explain his alternative policy, but all we heard was more personal invective, more negativity, more misrepresentation, more disinformation. The responsibility of leadership escapes the Leader of the Opposition. Under his leadership the coalition spends all its time conniving and deceiving for its own political benefit.                 There is a useful insight into this today in the Australian Financial Review, where it is reported that the Leader of the Opposition's policy director - that would not be a very busy job in the Leader of the Opposition's office, it has to be said - connived with the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, to publish completely deceitful material on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. What took place was a deliberate ploy to misrepresent the cost impact of a carbon price on public transport in New South Wales by no less than a factor of seven. It was completely overstated by a factor of seven. That is all that we get with the Leader of the Opposition: deceit, misrepresentation, negativity.                 As the parliament debates these bills, I ask all of those of good conscience on the other side to consider the issues very carefully, because the government's package is very important for the future of our country, our economy and our society. I know there are many on that side who wish to support it.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. I say to the member for Macquarie: the arrangement we have entered into with Malaysia is for the transfer of 800 people. The arrangement remains for the transfer of 800 people. We have the clearest possible advice from the experts that advise government that it is the plan with the maximum deterrence effect.                 The member for Macquarie may want to come to a different policy conclusion. That is a matter for her as a member of the House of Representatives. But, if the policy conclusion she comes to is that she would prefer to see asylum seeker processing on Nauru, she would need to directly confront the question: what are the implications of the High Court case?                 The implications of the High Court case are that she could not make that decision without it being the subject of a great deal of legal doubt and she certainly could not start transferring unaccompanied minors to Nauru. The Solicitor-General's advice about the High Court case is crystal clear on that.                     I am asked about the Malaysia agreement and I am talking about factors relating to it and operationalising it. I am reminding the member for Macquarie that, if she has not read and absorbed the Solicitor-General's advice, that is something she may choose to do. She may have already done so, but if she does absorb that advice she will see that his view, as Solicitor-General, the highest legal adviser the government has, is that processing on Nauru is subject to legal risk without amending the legislation and certainly unaccompanied minors could not be transferred. In those circumstances, even if you ran the legal risk in relation to transferring adults, you would obviously be in the position where you would be at some risk that people smugglers would start choosing to fill boats with children. No-one wants to run those risks.                  That means we need to amend the legislation and the question that will be before the parliament once the legislation is introduced is whether the opposition will vote for that and put executive government in the position that the Howard government was and that this government believed itself to be before the High Court case. I have been advised that the Leader of the Opposition has accepted the offer for a briefing at five o'clock on Friday afternoon in Melbourne. I am very pleased to see that.

  The Leader of the Opposition has either misheard or misconstrued or is misrepresenting what I just said.                     I am taking the question seriously and I will answer it, so maybe the opposition might want to cut the abuse and listen to the answer.                     We are discussing a matter of national interest and I presume all members of the House would be interested in this discussion. I may be wrong about that, but I will assume that all members of this House have an interest in securing Australia's borders and in the best possible policy in relation to refugees and asylum seekers.                  In response to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, I was asked by the member for Macquarie about whether we had an arrangement for 800 or whether we had extended it. I confirmed it was an arrangement for 800. I then went on to explain what I believed to be the merits of that agreement - that we had the best possible advice that the Malaysia agreement provided the best possible deterrence. I did not put that specifically about the figure and that is what the Leader of the Opposition has either misheard, misconstrued or is seeking to misrepresent. The Leader of the Opposition knows from the briefings he has received that the advice to us from the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and more broadly is that they believe the Malaysia arrangement has the maximum deterrence.                     On these important questions of national interest, and in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the Leader of the Opposition has received a briefing from the secretary of the department of immigration and others. That briefing has made clear to him their advice, and their advice is that, out of the options that government has at its disposal, Malaysia is the option with the maximum deterrence effect. I understand that on this question of national interest the Leader of the Opposition may well come to a different view. That is a matter for him. Executive government - this government - is determined to implement the Malaysia arrangement and to start a processing centre in accordance with our understandings with the government of PNG. I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to endorse that. I do not ask him to stop criticising it. I do not ask him to do anything in relation to that other than what he has done for many weeks now, which is to indicate that he does not believe in it, does not support it, does not agree with it and is full of criticisms of it. He should continue to do that if that is what he has come to in his mind as the best decision in all good conscience.                 What I am asking of the Leader of the Opposition is that, when amendments to the Migration Act come before this parliament - which this executive government does require in order to implement the arrangement with Malaysia and the centre in PNG, and which an alternative government, were one ever elected which had the Nauru proposal as its policy, would need to implement that policy to put it beyond legal doubt and to make modifications in relation to unaccompanied minors - he support that legislation. Behind all of this partisanship is one central fact: the government believes in and wants to implement offshore arrangements in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. The Leader of the Opposition wants to implement offshore arrangements in relation to asylum seekers. In order to do so in a way which is beyond legal doubt the Migration Act needs amending, so in the national interest I believe we should be able to agree on that.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question on carbon pricing. I do note that I did not receive a question on carbon pricing from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.                 On the member for O'Connor's question on carbon pricing: the government does intend to apply an effective carbon price to fuel use by heavy on-road transport from 1 July 2014. That is true, we intend to do that through fuel tax credits. We intend to do that because we want to ensure that there is competitive neutrality between the various ways that goods are moved around our country. Rail, domestic shipping and domestic aviation face an effective carbon price, so we believe that the alternative way of moving goods around should also face an effective carbon price.                 It is true that there were a variety of views about that on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, but the government's view is that there should be such an arrangement and we are determined that such an arrangement would come into force on 1 July 2014.                 The government estimates - and when I say the government here, I am talking about the experts who do modelling at Treasury, who advise this government and who have advised past governments - that the impact of heavy on-road coming into the scheme from 2014-15 is around 0.05 per cent. We have, as a prudent measure, taken that into account in designing the household assistance package. So although the household assistance package will, of course, come into effect prior to the introduction of that change for heavy vehicles, the 0.05 per cent has been taken into account.                 That means that the member for O'Connor will see in his electorate pensioners, parents of children and income earners who earn less than $80,000 a year seeing more dollars in their pockets. There are tax cuts, there are pension rises and there are family benefits changes.                 To give the member for O'Connor some statistics in relation to his own electorate, more than 13,000 families in O'Connor will receive household assistance through their family assistance payments and more than 20,000 pensioners in O'Connor will receive assistance - and will recall of course that we have modelled assistance for pensioners so they get more than they need to compensate for the average flow-through impact of carbon pricing. That is so that they can come out in front. In addition, the member for O'Connor will see 2,600 self-funded retirees in his electorate see more money, as will the 1,500 students, 4,200 jobseekers and 2,400 single parents. Then, of course, people who work in the electorate of O'Connor and who live there, whom the member represents in this parliament, will also see tax cuts.                 The member for O'Connor is able to tell his constituents and community that, yes, there will be an impact on heavy on-road vehicles from 2014-15, but it has already been taken -                      No, in the government's intentions. The government intentions are that -                      I thank friends in the parliament for assistance on clarity. This is a government-only measure, and the government are determined to pursue it. As a government-only measure it is our determination that it come into effect from 1 July 2014, but it has already been taken into account in the household assistance package.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that very important question, because this government is getting on with the job of rolling out a very big reform agenda: putting a price on carbon to drive investment in renewable energy; reforming our tax system; boosting national savings through our superannuation reforms; and, of course, putting in place reforms to skills and training and establishing the NBN. We are rolling out all of these reforms in a responsible way, and the rock on which they are built is a very credible, strict, clear and consistent fiscal policy. We are building on the strength of that fiscal policy by establishing a new Parliamentary Budget Office, an independent costing service. The PBO will ensure there is greater transparency and accountability in the costing of election programs in particular. For the first time ever in the history of this parliament, the opposition and individual members and senators will have access to an independent, confidential costing service outside the general election period, and they will have access to a fully transparent election policy costing service during election periods.                 This is absolutely fundamental to ensuring that the Australian public are informed about the costs of election promises, because the Australian people do not want to see ever again a repeat of what occurred during the last general election, when there was an $11 billion costings black hole in the budget estimates of the opposition. At the last election the opposition spent all of their time hiding their costings from the Australian people.                     Now we find they will say anything and do anything to run away from proper scrutiny the next time around as well. They are looking for any excuse to trash the Parliamentary Budget Office before it even gets off the ground. We had the member for Mackellar come into this House last night and mount a despicable attack on prominent public servants, and that was added to by the member for Goldstein. All of this comes after those opposite had sat on a joint select committee and supported in full the proposals for the Parliamentary Budget Office. Two shadow ministers supported it. The member for Higgins supported it, and she had this to say about the PBO back then: 'It will enhance transparency and accountability.' What has changed in the past five months? What has changed in the past five months is that there is a $70 billion crater in their budget estimates, before they add any new policies for the next election. The shadow Treasurer is so scarred by his incompetence that now he wants to hide from scrutiny during the next election campaign. There are 70 billion reasons why the shadow Treasurer wants to keep his costings hidden from the Australian public - 70 billion reasons why this mob cannot be trusted to run an economy and are unfit for public office.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question: (1) the government's policy is that we want to implement the arrangement with Malaysia, and that does require amending of the legislation, as I have already indicated to the Leader of the Opposition, and that is a decision he faces; (2) we have taken the best possible advice on structuring this arrangement and its deterrence value, and I am advised that the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Metcalfe, in discussing these questions with the opposition - he certainly said this to government, so this is the advice to us - said that the deterrence impact of transferring people will be very strong. So we obviously designed the Malaysia arrangement to have the maximum, strongest possible deterrence impact. So this is not about saying that this is processing of a certain number of people overseas in the way that, for example, under the Howard government a number of people were processed on Nauru. This is about people being transferred - people who are then not processed and do not come to Australia. So the deterrence effect -                    The member for Eden-Monaro then left the chamber.                     What I am endeavouring to explain to the Leader of the Opposition - based on the expert advice we have been given by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and what I believe the secretary actually said to the Leader of the Opposition in the briefing that he provided to the Leader of the Opposition - is that the secretary said it is up to 800 asylum seekers. Of course, our hope is that we would not need to transfer that many. Our aim is that we do not have to transfer that many, because the advice to us is that the strength of the deterrence effect is such that this will smash the people smugglers' business model.                     I am conveying to the House expert advice we have been given which has also been available to the Leader of the Opposition. This has the maximum deterrence effects. It smashes the people smugglers' business model because it takes away from them the very product they seek to sell, which is that people will be processed and end up in Australia. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition may contest all of this - and I know that he does - that is the advice that has been provided to us, and that is the advice that we are relying on. Once again, I say to the opposition that it is open to them to say they do not want to rely on this advice. It is open to them to say that they prefer a different policy solution. It is open to them to identify that policy solution as Nauru. That is a matter for them. Then they would have to answer a series of questions about costs, what happens when it is full and what happens when the expert advice proves to be right that there is no deterrence effect and the asylum seekers are resettled here in Australia. That will be a matter for them, but the important point before this parliament is not the contest between our plan and the opposition's plan. The important point that will come before the parliament next week is having the legislative foundation stone so executive government can implement the plan that it prefers; for this government to implement Malaysia and PNG and for a future government, should one ever be elected with the policy of processing asylum seekers on Nauru, to have the opportunity to do that. That is the question that the Leader of the Opposition will need to answer. I do not ask him to endorse the government's plan. I ask him to seriously consider, in the national interest, amending the legislation as he will need to do to support the plan he says he believes in.

  I thank the Chief Government Whip for his important question, which comes 12 months to the day since the Gillard government ministry was sworn in after our election victory last August. That is why we are sitting on this side of the House and why the opposition are still on that side of the House.                 Indeed, the government has a very big agenda. Since we were sworn in, the House of Representatives has carried 191 bills through the House - that is, 191 in this column and a big zero in their column because not one piece of legislation has been defeated. The parliament is functioning and it is functioning well in spite of the wrecking tactics of those opposite. The parliament said yes to the structural separation of Telstra; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to rebuilding Queensland after the devastation of the floods and Cyclone Yasi; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to a fully-costed and fair paid parental leave scheme; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to a budget that invested in jobs and the economy with record spending in mental health; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to national health reform; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to the National Broadband Network, with not just one but five bills carried through the House; those opposite said no, no, no, no and no.                 The government is determined to meet our future challenges. That is why we are saying yes to the creation of a Parliamentary Budget Office. That is why we are saying yes to the clean energy bills that are before the parliament, but in this case not everyone is saying no. The member for Wentworth, who was due to speak this morning on the clean energy bills, took himself off the list. But he knew that he could contribute because prior to question time he had this to say in response to the question, is the carbon tax to the plan that you and Ian McFarlane negotiated?                 I think all of these schemes have got a lot in common. This one obviously has quite a lengthy fixed-price period. That's why it's called a carbon tax.                 All of these schemes - whether it is one Peter Shergold canvassed when we were in government or the Rudd CPRS, as amended in the negotiations with Ian and myself, or this one - have a lot in common.                 Indeed they do. Both had a fixed-price period, both led to an emissions trading scheme and both were supported by the member for Wentworth - not just in his heart but in his head, as they are supported by everyone who takes climate change seriously. It is only this side of the parliament that has a future agenda on jobs, skills, infrastructure, education and health. Those opposite simply have a negative agenda of carping and opposing everything that is put forward.

  The question simply is not right. The member is misrepresenting the situation, but if the member is in any way interested in expert advice then I would suggest that he get across the expert advice that is being provided to government and to the opposition. Can I say generally to the opposition, I understand that there will continue to be political contest about the nature of policies and plans in the area of refugees and asylum seekers. So be it. That is what the House of Representatives is for. We will in that political contest refer to the expert advice that supports us. The opposition may choose not to rely on that expert advice. That is a matter for it. What this parliament will be called upon to determine is the legislation and how it should read. Facts are facts and you cannot wish them away. The Solicitor-General has been clear that for offshore processing to proceed, whether that offshore processing is in PNG, in Nauru or whether there is the Malaysia transfer agreement -                      The Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'That is not a fact; it's an opinion.' It is a fact that the highest legal officer who advises government gave this advice. That is fact and you cannot wish that fact away. The Solicitor-General has advised government that to put offshore processing beyond doubt, even it were occur in Nauru, as the Leader of the Opposition prefers, the legislation needs amending to ensure that such arrangements could include the transfer of unaccompanied minors. If you do not make that amendment then you run all of the legal risks. Then what do you do? You send a message to people-smugglers to fill boats with children. These are facts. They cannot be wished away. They cannot be denied. They must be dealt with.                 The only thing we are asking the opposition to do as we absorb these facts together, and the Leader of the Opposition gets the opportunity to have briefings in depth, is to put the law in an appropriate state -                      Exactly. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'Put the law back as it was.' Yes, put the law back so executive government is in the position that the Howard government believed itself to be in in relation to offshore processing and this government believed itself to be in in relation to offshore processing before the High Court case. Then, having amended the law, we will implement the Malaysia arrangement and one with PNG, the opposition can knock themselves out with criticisms of that arrangement, we will have the election in 2013, and the Australian people can make a decision between the government's policies and plans and the opposition's policies and plans. What the opposition should not do, in my view, is refuse to amend the legislation and in doing so deny themselves the legal foundation stone for the policy that they say they support. So this is the decision for the parliament. Legislation will be introduced next week. The Leader of the Opposition will get briefings on Friday afternoon. I think it is a very good thing that he is availing himself of those briefings. I am pleased we were able to negotiate and get a time that works for everybody on Friday, and I trust that he will seriously consider the advice and information that he receives during that briefing in the national interest.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She is a true advocate and champion for manufacturing workers in this country, and I can assure her that the government is working to keep our economy strong by making sure that Australian manufacturers are supported from unfair trading practices such as dumping.                 The government's improvements to the anti-dumping system will deliver faster resolution of complaints. Indeed, we are committed to increasing staff of Customs from 31 to 45 to ensure Customs has the right level of resources but also to ensure additional experts such as forensic accountants in order to ensure we have quicker and more effective advice so we can prevent dumping in this country. Customs, of course, will also consider the need for provisional measures at the earliest opportunity in an investigation rather than waiting until verifying all data, something that I believe has been a problem for manufacturers and producers in this country for some time. Indeed, the legislation that has passed the House will have a 30-day time limit on the minister's decision making for such cases. By way of comparison, under the Howard government Minister Vanstone would take up to more than one year to make decisions in this area. That certainly frustrated the parties.                 The government's improvements will also enable us to identify dumping behaviour by making particular market situation provisions more effective and making significant changes to the appeals process and amending the definition of material injury. The reforms will ensure greater consistency with other countries by taking into account relevant cases and practices in other jurisdictions, specifically in relation to non-cooperative parties. Indeed, legislation currently before the parliament also rectifies an omission of the Howard government, ensuring that Australian industry can take action against the same unfair subsidies overseas that everybody else can. These are very important reforms. The government will also ensure compliance with the trade remedies in place through increased monitoring and anti-circumvention measures. The International Trade Remedies Forum has been established, representing industry, to provide ongoing advice to governments on the effectiveness of anti-dumping.                 I have been asked about alternative views. The fact is that there are no alternative views coming from the opposition, other than to say that the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply in speech in May, made reference to dumping but has done nothing since. Indeed, in February, the opposition set up a task force -                      Indeed, the member for Indi chairs this task force, which has no tasks and indeed no meaningful force. It has been there since February, telling workers around this country it is going to help them. But what have we seen since February? Absolutely nothing. The member for Indi was at the Press Club today. She spoke for 30 minutes. There were no announcements, no reforms, in this very important area, because in the end, when it comes to the opposition, they are a policy-free zone. We have rhetorical drivel from the member for Indi. The reality is that this government cares about manufacturing in this country and it cares about agriculture in this country. That is why the employer bodies, the unions and the National Farmers Federation have supported our reforms. What we know is that the Leader of the Opposition may talk about dumping but in the end he will use workers as a prop in a media stunt; he will walk away from those workers in the same way he will walk away from their entitlements. Giving the Leader of the Opposition control of employment conditions is like giving Dracula the keys of the blood bank.

  I thank the member for Calwell very much for her question because she knows that this government is determined to continue to implement the commitments we have made to put a price on carbon pollution and the commitments we have made, and continue to make, to pensioners to support them and help them meet their household budgets.                 It is the big polluters and not Australian pensioners who are going to have to pay for the pollution that those big polluters put into our atmosphere. We are delivering a real and permanent increase to the pension. Under our plan to put a price on pollution, Australia's 3.4 million pensioners will receive assistance that more than covers their average expected price increases. Australia's 3.4 million pensioners will get that extra assistance as a result of the legislation that this government has introduced into the parliament. Pensioners will receive both the clean energy advance and a clean energy supplement to make sure that they get ongoing assistance. That assistance will be worth $338 a year for singles and $255 a year for each member of a couple. It will be the case that both the pension and the clean energy supplement will be indexed to make sure that pensioners can keep up with the cost of living.                 As the member for Calwell and everybody on this side of the parliament knows, this builds on the very significant increases to the pension that we have delivered since 2009. From next Tuesday, 20 September, pensioners in Australia can expect to get another increase to their pension as a result of improved indexation that this government has delivered as a result of the major reforms we have put in place.                 What we know, unfortunately, is that the Liberals in New South Wales -                      It is absolutely relevant to what we are doing for pensioners because, as the Speaker may recall, the Prime Minister put a request to the premiers and chief ministers of Australia asking them to make sure that the pension rise that we put in place in 2009 stayed in the purses and wallets of pensioners, that it was not gobbled up in the increased public housing rents. Unfortunately, it is the case that last week the New South Wales Premier announced that he is reneging on that agreement and they are increasing public housing rents.                     They are now increasing public housing rents for 68,000 pensioners in New South Wales.

  I thank the member for his question. The government are proud that 12 months ago, when we were sworn in as a government, we had already declared that we would be the first country to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. Now, 12 months on, this chamber has passed the measures. We expect that the measures will be before the Senate next week. I hope very much that the Senate will support the measures in the same fashion that they were supported in the House. It would be particularly timely given that next week, as part of the United Nations General Assembly, the first non-communicable diseases conference is being held. It will be only the second time in the history of the United Nations that they have had a dedicated health forum combined with the General Assembly. Last time, as members would know, it was to deal with HIV. Now it is to deal with the growing burdens caused by cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and a range of other illnesses, which are caused in large part by a number of risk factors and tobacco is the leading one amongst them.                 We are very proud to be part of a government that is delivering on our commitment to be the first country to introduce plain packaging. Of course this reform has not been easy. It will not necessarily have an easy passage in the Senate. It is being met by very ferocious opposition from big tobacco companies that have spent in the order of $10 million on negative advertising campaigns. We are absolutely determined to do what is right here. We know that, if we can reduce the harm from tobacco related disease, not only will we significantly reduce the number of Australians who die each and every year from tobacco related illnesses - 15,000 - but, more importantly, we will also ensure that the number of families who suffer as a result of those deaths is reduced in the future.                  I hope the opposition will encourage their Senate colleagues to support this measure in the Senate next week. I think it will be a proud moment for Australia, which has a history of both sides of politics having taken ambitious steps in leading the world on tobacco control, to have this measure passed at the very time the rest of the world is debating measures that can also be taken on tobacco control. If Australia is the first to introduce this measure, we know we will not be the last. That will be good for countries around the world and many thousands of people. It is estimated nearly six million people around the world die every year from tobacco related illnesses. We can take a step to make a difference. We can help the rest of the world take a step to make a difference too.

  I believe the member for Sturt's question is grossly inappropriate because it is doing what I do not think should be done in this place about any member of parliament and what I will specifically decline to do about members of parliament who face some sort of inquiry and that is to make a decision in advance of that inquiry about what the facts may be. If I were the sort of person who did that then I could start doing that about a senator from the Liberal Party. I do not believe that would be appropriate. Indeed, I believe that would be quite wrong.                 Let us be very transparent about what has been done today. Mr Speaker, on another occasion you may choose to reflect on these questions. The opposition has put a values proposition about something in general and then has basically sought to assert that a member is in breach of that values proposition with no facts or evidence before them. If we are going to start that, I do genuinely fear where it will end. The appropriate conduct for members of parliament if matters are being investigated by appropriate authorities is to await the outcome of those investigations.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I know he carries on a very proud tradition of members from the constituency of Throsby really arguing long and hard for jobs in their electorate.                  The government is serious about reform because reform is all about making Australia a better place for people to live in and to grow up in. It is about tackling dangerous climate change by putting a price on carbon pollution. It is about rolling out an accessible National Broadband Network. It is about transforming education right around the country to make every school a great school. It comes on the back of a proud tradition of Labor reforms which can tell people what we on this side of the House are about. Whether it is Medicare or compulsory superannuation, we are fair dinkum about reform and about bringing these policies through to make sure they improve the opportunities for Australians in the future.                 There are some big reforms out there in education if you think about it. There is a new building in every one of our schools - not 3,000 flagpoles against 3,000 libraries, but new halls, new classrooms, new science laboratories; an Australian curriculum accessible to every student wherever they live; national standards for the teaching profession; and hundreds of thousands of computers installed. I put out a statement today saying that I am pleased to see that we had 75 per cent of the total installed by the end of June. We have invested record amounts in literacy and numeracy and record amounts in assisting kids from low socioeconomic communities lift their education capacity. Of course there is the once-in-a-generation opportunity through the independent Gonski review of school funding.                 We are also doing it in higher education. There is a significant amount of investment again - nearly double what we saw from the previous government. There are 130,000 new training places now being provided and record numbers of apprentices and trainees with skills. In higher education we now have more young Australians than ever before being given the opportunity of a university degree. There was an important announcement today that students from inner regional areas are able to access the independent youth allowance under exactly the same rules that apply to students from outer regional, remote and very remote areas. I am asked how this is being received. On the BER, Trevor Gordon, the Principal of Cairns State High School, said in the Cairns Post in October:                 It is one of the most wonderful facilities I've seen in my 38 years as a teacher.                 I have heard many comments like that from principals around Australia, as I know have my colleagues on this side of the House.                     On the national curriculum, Martin Dixon, the Victorian minister, said:                 It is a historic occasion. It is one that teachers and educators have been waiting for for a long time.                 I could not agree more. On national professional standards for teachers, Sheree Vertigan, who is from the Australian Secondary Principals Association, said:                 The standards are a crucial platform for building teacher quality in all secondary schools across Australia.                 Those opposite may not be willing to have their budget cuts subject to the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office, but our investments in education ensure that young Australians now will have jobs in the future.

  To the member for Wannon I say that I am happy to talk to him about an individual constituent matter, if that is what he would like me to do. More generally I say to him that we are determined to create a clean energy future for this country. That is why we introduced the legislation yesterday. This is a nation-changing reform about jobs and prosperity in the future and about making sure that we do the right thing by our environment and that we accept the best of scientific advice and the best of economists' advice. It does really amaze me as we move to the end of the second question time after the introduction of these bills that the Leader of the Opposition has been asking about everything else but not asking about this. Perhaps that is because he knows he cannot explain his policy, because he failed to do so in his speech today, which I came in to listen to.                     So, to the member for Wannon, if he genuinely has an issue on behalf of a constituent then I am very happy to address that matter with him directly.

  I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. In the last 12 months we have delivered a lot of equipment for our soldiers in Afghanistan. That includes the upgrading of our Bushmaster vehicles. Our troops in Afghanistan now also have new combat body armour and are wearing a new combat uniform. We have also rolled out a new counterrocket system that warns our troops of rocket attacks at the base at Tarin Kowt as well as a number of our forward operating bases. They are all part of the $1.6 billion Force Protection package that the government is implementing.                 I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago and had the opportunity to talk to our soldiers about this new equipment, and their feedback on the ground was very positive. That said, there is still more work to do. There is always more work to do particularly in the area of IEDs. Earlier this year we made the decision to purchase an additional 101 Bushmaster vehicles to replace those that had been destroyed, as well as supporting current and future operations. On Monday, the Minister for Defence and I announced an agreement with the Canadian government for a number of ground-penetrating radar systems to help to clear the roads of IEDs in Oruzgan province.                 In Air Force in the last 12 months, 20 of our new Super Hornets have been delivered and the next four Super Hornets will be delivered in the next month. In March, members may remember, we made the decision to purchase a fifth C17 heavy-lift aircraft, and it will arrive in Australia in the next few weeks. Work is also well underway on the first air warfare destroyer and I know some of that work is occurring in the member for Newcastle's electorate. Work is also underway on the two new landing helicopter dock ships. The Largs Bay, which we have purchased from the UK government earlier this year, will arrive in Australia in December where it will be commissioned HMAS Choules, after Claude Choules who died in May this year and who, members will know, served in the Royal Navy in World War I and then migrated to Australia and served in the Royal Australian Navy in World War II.                 The question also asked about the Australian defence industry. The Australian defence industry does a lot of work for Defence, about $5Â½ billion worth every year. Over the next decade that will increase to about $7Â½ billion in today's terms. There is a reason for that. Over the next 10 to 15 years we will replace or upgrade 85 per cent of our military equipment, and that is a big challenge. It is important that we get it right and a key part of that is making sure that we have the skills that we need to do the job. The biggest mountain we will have to climb is the future submarine project, potentially the biggest and most complex defence project Australia has ever undertaken. It will potentially involve hundreds of companies, thousands of workers and a lot of skills that we do not currently have in sufficient numbers today. Some of the skills will come from overseas but many will need to be grown here in Australia. That is why I have asked Skills Australia to work with Defence and the defence industry on the range and depth of skills that we will need over the next decade and the best way to build them. This will help us to meet the challenges that lie ahead.                 Ultimately, that is what government is all about: meeting the challenges of today and the challenges of the future. Whether it is climate change, building the National Broadband Network, increasing the superannuation of Australian workers or providing our troops with the equipment that they need, this government is delivering now to meet the challenges of the future.

  Firstly, to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I just remind that the government will not be seeking to legislate the arrangement with Malaysia. We will be seeking to introduce into the Migration Act general powers which will enable a government - this government or any government in the future - to implement offshore processing arrangements in nations as they see fit.                 Obviously the government is committed to the arrangement with Malaysia and also putting a centre in PNG, and we have been in discussions with the government of PNG about that. The Leader of the Opposition has a different plan, and his different plan is about Nauru. That too, to be beyond legal doubt, would require legislative amendment and also to deal with some very complex matters involving unaccompanied minors.                 The Leader of the Opposition asked me about discussions with other parliamentarians, including Senator Bob Brown. Senator Brown is, of course, aware of the government's plans. They have been very clearly canvassed in the media and the government will be bringing legislation to the parliament -                  On the point of order made by the minister for regional development, which I would characterise as a point of order on the basis of a belief that the original point of order was an interference in the proceedings, I am happy that the standing orders allow that there be one point of order on relevance during a question and I am then obliged to rule on that. I do suggest that it is the form of the points of order that perhaps the House or the Procedures Committee could look at where the standing order that the point of order is about should be the subject of the point of order without debating the point of order. It is the debating of the point of order that is the interference. The Prime Minister has the call. She has been relevant to the question and she has the call.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition about discussions with Senator Brown. What I was endeavouring to make clear is that the government's policies and plans are of course known to Senator Brown, as is already very clear to the Leader of the Opposition and, I would suspect, everybody else in this nation.                 Senator Brown is opposed to the government's policies and plans because Senator Brown is opposed to the offshore processing of asylum seekers. I therefore anticipate, in accordance with Senator Brown's publicly stated view that he is opposed to offshore processing of asylum seekers, that he would vote against amendments to the Migration Act that facilitated offshore processing of asylum seekers.                 So the question that will come before the parliament is a question about amending the Migration Act to enable government to have the power to have offshore processing. The question, really, that I would suggest the Leader of the Opposition direct his attention to is: when that legislation comes to the parliament, will he and Bob Brown be voting together?

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and her deep interest in representing her constituents in this parliament while also ensuring that her constituents can live in a nation where opportunity is shared and where we show appropriate care and concern for each other so we are not leaving people, industries or regions behind.                  We live in a world of remarkable change. Our planet, our world, is changing with economic weight moving to our region of the world. This is great news for our country. The tyranny of distance that has held Australia back in many ways in past ages will be there no more. We are in the right place at the right time in history in the growing region of the world. We come to this change economically strong as a result of having ensured that our economy kept generating jobs and protecting jobs during the days of the global financial crisis. By acting we kept Australians in work, and there is nothing more important to Australian families than having a job.                 In this phase of our economic transformation it is very important that we continue to reform and we continue to face up to the hard challenges that are necessary to ensure our continued prosperity. They include making sure that we are reforming our education system, because the skills and capacities of the Australian people are ultimately our best comparative advantage in the world. It is about making sure we invest in infrastructure including the infrastructure of the future, the National Broadband Network. It is about making sure that we are providing the services that Australians rely on in the most efficient way. Our health reform agreement is a major step forward in doing that. We are working through profound reform agendas as our society ages and we need to care for more older Australians and also in the area of disability to make sure that we are not leaving Australians behind because they have faced a life circumstance where they or a member of their family has a disability.                 These are all major challenges, but we are also facing up to the big challenge of climate change and to making sure that in the future economic growth and emissions growth are not one and the same, that we can decouple economic growth from growth in carbon pollution. This week we introduced to the parliament our plan to reduce carbon pollution and to create the clean energy jobs of the future. It is a plan where polluters pay and Australian families will receive tax cuts and increased family payments, and where pensioners will see increased payments. It is a plan to make sure that our nation innovates and that we see clean energy jobs in this country. It is a plan to ensure that we reach the national goals we have set ourselves, including the unconditional five per cent reduction in emissions.                 I note that today the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, composed of miners and manufacturers, has provided a costing of the Leader of the Opposition's plan and confirmed that it will cost Australian families $1,300 a year. That is a cost that Australians should not need to bear.                     In conclusion, I believe it is the responsibility of all members of this House as we legislate to put a price on carbon to do that in the cheapest possible way for Australian families and Australian businesses. That is exactly what the government is committed to doing.

  As I believe the parliament is now well aware, given the number of questions on this issue this week, the government has received and is relying on advice about the deterrence effect of the arrangement with Malaysia. That is the truth. It may be an uncomfortable truth for those opposite, but that is the truth. We have made that briefing and advice available to those opposite. I do not ask that the opposition therefore endorse the government's policies and plans, but I do believe that it is in the national interest that the government of this country, whether it is this government or a government five, 10, 15 years down the track, has the powers that it needs to process asylum seekers offshore and to transfer them to other countries if it chooses to do so. Ultimately, the only proposition that will come before this parliament will not be the endorsement of the Malaysia arrangement; it will not be endorsement of the construction of a centre in PNG; it will not be endorsement of the construction of a centre in Nauru. It will be whether or not executive government should have the power to transfer asylum seekers to third countries. I am in favour of that.                     As I was saying, the question for this parliament will not be about the endorsement of a particular plan, whether it be the Malaysia arrangement or some other plan. It will be a legal question - a legislative question - on whether a government should have the power to transfer asylum seekers to third countries, yes or no. The Leader of the Opposition has accepted an invitation to some further briefings on these matters tomorrow. I am very glad to see that. Hopefully - I do genuinely hope this - beyond those briefings the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally will see their way clear to agreeing with the government that executive government should have that power.

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. As I indicated to the House yesterday, the passage of the clean energy bills will unleash a lot of investment in clean energy generation and clean technology innovation. This is going to be critical to future growth in our productivity and our living standards. That is something that is well understood by economists around the world. However, there does appear to be some ignorance of the facts and of the economic benefits, by those opposite, about this. For example, on Monday, the Leader of the Opposition claimed the following:                 There is no way on God's earth that you can have a solar powered steel mill, just as there is no way on this earth you can have a wind powered manufacturing plant and anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.                 That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. Unfortunately, this does ignore the facts and the evidence that these types of investments exist. For example, in Germany, BMW are currently building wind turbines at their Leipzig manufacturing plant that will provide the electricity to assemble hundreds of vehicles per day from 2013.                 In the United Kingdom, Ford's diesel assembly plant is already completely wind powered - a manufacturing facility completely wind powered. Also in the United Kingdom, a Nissan auto plant currently has -                       I was saying that also in the United Kingdom a Nissan auto plant currently has 10 on-site wind turbines producing up to 10 per cent of the energy required for the plant. In France, solar powered furnaces with the capacity to reach temperatures of 3,000 degrees plus and capable of melting steel are already in operation. What do each of these countries, in which these facilities are located, have in common? They have a carbon price in their economy.                   The member for Bowman then left the chamber.                     Facts are very important in this debate. And it is also important to look at the outlook for the coal industry in this respect. ABS data that was released yesterday revealed that coal exploration in Australia reached a record high - 66 per cent higher than the December 2010 quarter, the last period before we released the carbon pricing framework. This is the industry that the Leader of the Opposition said 'would be destroyed' by a carbon price. There are record levels of investment and exploration going on.                     Also, as the Prime Minister mentioned, the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network that does represent miners and manufacturers - a group not always on our side in many issues - confirmed that the opposition leader's plan, his so-called 'subsidies for polluters' direct action plan, would cost households $1,300 a year in 2020.                 We know what the Leader of the Opposition does when someone does not agree with him. He has a go at them. Just have a look at the scientists and the economists.                     The plebiscite bill went down today, too - another stunt. The carbon price is a key economic and fundamental environmental reform. I call upon all of those opposite who support action on climate change to support these bills.

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In answer to the member's question, first and foremost, can I say to the member, she would be aware that we have people -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am endeavouring to answer the member's question because it is a question about an important policy area, a policy area that goes to our core national interest. The answer to the member's question is as follows. The member is probably aware that we do have already in detention asylum seekers, and so we do need detention capacity for asylum seekers who are currently in Australia. The member may also be aware that we use detention capacity for more than asylum seekers who arrive unauthorised by boat. We use detention capacity for a wide variety of purposes related to immigration management, so people are detained for other reasons.                 Can I say to the member as well that the question that will be introduced before the parliament next week will not be a question about whether or not she believes in the Malaysia arrangement. That is a matter for her, and she may choose on the weekend to consult her constituents about their views about national security, their views about border protection and their views about refugee and asylum seeker policy. But there will be nothing in this parliament that asks her to vote on the question of whether or not she endorses the arrangement with Malaysia. The vote in this parliament will be on amendments to the Migration Act which would enable the member, if she was a member of the government, if she ever served in a future government in the capacity of minister for immigration -                      I was specifically asked about detention capacity in view of the Malaysia arrangement, so I am addressing that. I am pointing out to the parliament that in relation to the Malaysia arrangement no-one will be asked to vote on that. People will be asked to vote on amendments to the Migration Act which will enable a government, including this government, to process people offshore.                     In conclusion, I will be asking, as I am asking now, members of the opposition to very seriously consider their position on these amendments, given the seriousness of this issue to our national interest.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question. It enables me to talk to the House about the future tax forum and tax reform generally. First, it is very important to ensure the House has the facts at its fingertips. The Howard government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. I know that members of the opposition are in denial about this very simple fact.                     I am trying to share a few simple facts with the House. Under the former Howard government, tax as a share of GDP reached 24.1 per cent -                      in 2004-05 and 2005-06.                     That is a fact - 24.1 per cent, making the Howard government the highest taxing government in Australia's history.                     Tax as a share of GDP inherited by this government was 23.5 per cent - that is, it had come down from the Howard government's peak as the highest taxing government in the nation's history. For 2011-12, tax as a percentage of GDP will be 21.8 per cent. Importantly, that is less than the tax share -                      I was asked about tax and the tax forum coming up in a few weeks time. I was creating the baseline fact that I think people need to know that tax as a share of GDP is less now than when this government was first elected in 2007 and certainly less than the highest taxing peak under the Howard government, as the highest taxing government in the nation's history.                  I am asked by the member for Lyne about the efficiency of taxes. On the question of the efficiency of taxes, the government has been engaged in a tax reform agenda, including the tax reform agenda associated with lifting the tax-free threshold, which takes one million Australians out of the tax system. The member for Lyne has also directed my attention to the inefficiency of state taxes - the number of them and the inefficiency of them.                     I was asked by the member about inefficient state taxes and I am responding directly to that. The member raises this question and he is right to do so. It was the subject of a great deal of attention under the Henry tax review. Self-evidently, state taxes are a state responsibility, but I will certainly be encouraging participants at the tax forum, including representatives of state governments to bring proposals for fewer taxes.                     I will certainly be encouraging that because the efficiency of our tax system is very important to the Australian nation and, as past tax studies, including the Henry tax review, have shown, there is a large number of inefficient state taxes; so, of course, it would be desirable for our economy for state governments to address this question and to have fewer taxes.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his very important question, because it is three years ago today to the very day that we saw the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, which sent shock waves right through global financial markets. On that day the world did look into an economic abyss that eventually became the global financial crisis and the global recession. What followed that was an enormous amount of instability in the global economy and a collapse in global demand. What that led to was the worst recession globally in 75 years. Given the magnitude of all these events, it is perhaps not surprising that the world is still living with the aftershocks of the global financial crisis and the global recession. We can see this in very slow growth rates in Europe and in the United States and we can see it in the really high levels of long-term unemployment right across so many advanced economies; and, of course, we can still see it today in the instability in global financial markets. But the thing that is very pleasing for our country is that we are uniquely placed: we are in a position of fundamental strength in the middle of this uncertainty and turbulence elsewhere in the global economy. Our economy is stronger than our peers because we as a government took the hard decisions. We as a government got the big economic calls right in this parliament, particularly at the end of 2008 and through early 2009. The consequence of that for this country is that we did not experience the capital destruction, the skills destruction and the high unemployment that plagued so many other developed economies. We did that because we worked together and because this parliament passed not just one but two sensible stimulus packages. The consequence of that has been an economic strength in this country unlike that of our peers. In particular you can see it in terms of unemployment. Unemployment in this country is far lower than that in the United States. When the world went into the global financial crisis the unemployment rate in the United States and Australia was the same. It is almost twice that now in the United States.                 So we have an exceptional record in terms of supporting employment, including nearly three-quarters of a million jobs in this country over the past four years - a very strong record of employment creation and, as we saw from the national accounts, a strong investment pipeline, solid consumption and very good income growth. These are all very good indicators which tell us about the underlying resilience of our economy, but, of course, there are parts of the economy that are doing it tough. That is why we need to put in place a fundamental reform program to assist people across the economy. We can see that those sectors of the economy that are affected by a high dollar are doing it tough. That is one of the reasons why we need the MRRT and the revenue from that to give a tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses - the instant asset write-off worth $6,500 to assist those struggling small businesses. That is why we do need to invest in infrastructure. That is why we need to build the NBN. That is why we need to boost our national savings by building up superannuation.                 All of this is based on a very strict, clear and consistent fiscal policy. That is the rock that the resilience of our economy comes from. That is an objective which is not shared by those opposite. In terms of the Parliamentary Budget Office, which we need for transparency to indicate who is serious about strong fiscal policy, we have found out that those opposite want to hide this from the public -                      For all of the reasons that I have outlined in the House, we support the Parliamentary Budget Office. We support the recommendation of the joint committee, which was supported by those opposite and is now opposed by them.                    The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.

  The government's policy is not to reintroduce temporary protection visas. As the shadow minister would be aware, we have been provided with very clear advice, which has also been shared with the opposition, that temporary protection visas do not have the deterrence value that has been claimed for them and they have the potential to encourage family groups and women and children onto boats, which is not something that anybody wants to see.

 I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The figures released today by the independent Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics clearly show the strength and resilience of the Australian economy. They are also a very strong statement about our capacity to manage the implementation of the MRRT and our confidence in the future of our economy.                 Let us deal with a few hard facts. Firstly, export earnings from resources and energy commodities have set a new record, reaching $175 billion in 2010-11. Secondly, this is an increase of 27 per cent on 2009-10 and a nine per cent increase on the previous record of $160 billion set in 2008-09. Clearly, the decisive action we took as a government through the global financial crisis is bearing fruit. Our community had confidence in our capacity to go forward and use the resources and energy boom to further strengthen the diversification of the Australian economy. I would also remind you that we have achieved this result despite the serious adverse weather effects experienced in Queensland, the Cooper Basin and the Pilbara region of Western Australia earlier this year. It is also interesting to note that we have not alone benefited from high commodity prices. We are also seeing increases in export volumes, which is very important. That is related to the fact that we as a government have invested and will continue to invest in productivity related issues such as the skilling of the Australian workforce and infrastructure. It is also why we are working with the resource and energy sector to try and encourage them to invest in the skilling of our Indigenous community side by side, by focusing on the increased employment of women in this sector, and to use migration with a focus on skilled and semi-skilled migration agreements to enable us to deliver these projects on time and on budget.                 Take the value of liquefied natural gas. Exports of LNG have hit for the first time $10 billion, with export volumes up 12 per cent and the value of exports up 34 per cent in 2009-10. These are exceptional results that we should be proud of as a nation. Similar results apply across a range of commodities, be it iron ore, metallurgical and thermal coal or, for that matter, copper. Importantly, they say to the domestic and international economies that we as a nation are a safe haven for investment. That is why we have a capital investment pipeline at the moment of $430 billion, of which $110 billion is in the LNG sector. I am also confident that over the next six to eight months we will achieve a further investment of $50 billion to $60 billion, effectively meaning that by Easter of next year we will have $500 billion committed to new capital investment in Australia.                 Our responsibility is to use this opportunity to assist those sections of the Australian economy who are finding it tough because of the strength of the Australian dollar coming off the back of the strength of our resources sector. It is about diversifying our economy, smart investment in manufacturing, support for financial and legal services and the importance of our hospitality and catering services sector. We are the envy of the world when it comes to economic opportunities, and the Australian community can have a sound confidence in our economic future.

  In relation to the member for Sturt's question, no, my office has made no such call. It would not be trying to direct Fair Work Australia about what it should do in the independent exercise of its discretion. That would be quite wrong. If the member for Sturt is trying to encourage me to do something that would be quite wrong, then I will not do it.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and her commitment, like all of those on this side of this House, to a clean energy future for this country. In the last two months since the Prime Minister announced the package, I have attended, at the invitation of 17 regional development authorities around the country, 17 carbon forums and one in Rockhampton in the member for Capricornia's electorate. In all of these areas there is a common theme.                     That is just not right.                     You were at the one where they said they did want it, if the truth is known. You came along to disrupt then and you are trying to disrupt now.

  In answer to the member's question, can I ask her to reflect on this: why is it that Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron would have set such an incredibly ambitious target for carbon pollution reduction - much more ambitious than the bipartisan target in this country - if he believed that the statistics that the member has just used were right? Indeed, with the sister political party to the Liberal Party in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron is embarking on this course because he sees the prospect of new jobs for his economy.                     His economy does need those new jobs because of how it has come out of the global financial crisis, and he sees the economic opportunity of this. So I suggest to the member that she may want to get some information from the related political party in the United Kingdom about the job creation prospects that British Conservatives see from dealing with carbon pollution. In this nation, I refer the member to the -                      I was, of course, responding to the fact that UK research was cited in the question. On the question of jobs in Australia, I refer the member to the Treasury modelling which shows that to 2020 we will see 1.6 million jobs created in this country. We will see people in jobs. There is nothing more important to this government than people being in jobs. That is why we reacted so swiftly during the global financial crisis, and we were distressed to see that the opposition did not want to support the work of Australians during that crisis. It is why, as we move to a clean energy future, our focus is on jobs and the creation of jobs - 1.6 million jobs by 2020. As the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government has just outlined and as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency outlined a little bit earlier in question time, there are jobs in this clean energy future. There are new jobs - jobs that we cannot imagine now but that people will do in the future. In the same way, with the information technology revolution when it first started, people would not have foreseen that there would be jobs in being a blogger; people would not have foreseen there would be jobs at an entity like Google.                   The member for Tangney then left the chamber.                     There will be jobs created that we cannot even imagine now, but there will also be the jobs that have been done over time over the ages - traditional jobs: jobs in steelmaking, jobs in plumbing and jobs in construction. These are very traditional jobs that will be done differently.                     The member now interjects about steelmaking. Maybe she does not understand. She is voting against a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan -                      and she will be denying steelworkers in this country the support that they need. If the member for Gilmore is seriously concerned about jobs then, first, she should get across the facts about our clean energy future, and then she should walk into this parliament and vote for jobs.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Experience tells us that today seven Australians will die through suicide and more than 200 will make a suicide attempt. One in four young males who die do so through suicide. It is the biggest killer of men under 45 and women under 35. Some groups in our community, like Indigenous Australians, gay and lesbian Australians and Australians who are themselves bereaved through suicide, are particularly vulnerable. I do not imagine there is any member in this place who has not been affected by suicide either personally or in their role as a community representative.                 The Prime Minister's commitment last year to redouble our efforts and our investment in suicide prevention forms an important part of this year's record mental health package. Those investments include expanding capacity for suicide crisis hotlines, infrastructure at notorious suicide hotspots, more money for successful community initiatives in suicide prevention and much more. Often the most effective strategies are the simplest.                 Today is RU OK? Day, the third year in which this campaign has been run with the support of the Australian government. The message of RU OK? Day is that taking the time to ask someone you know who seems out of sorts, 'Are you okay?' can be the trigger to them seeking help and finding their way out of a dark and potentially suicidal place. It reminds us that, as important as government investment and government services undoubtedly are, looking out for those around us is an essential part of helping people we know and people we love to take that first step towards seeking help.                 The message has been extremely successful. The campaign uses social media brilliantly. It has enlisted the pulling power of ambassadors like Jack Thompson, Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts as well as a list of NRL stars who continue to speak to that diminishing number of Australians who continue to hold out against the ultimately irresistible spread of the AFL. Hundreds of workplaces and businesses around the country are sponsoring RU OK? events at work today to get the message out to their employees. Here in Parliament House an RU OK? morning tea was co-hosted by Senator Humphries and our own member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, who I think is the only qualified mental health professional at least in this chamber.                 In 2009, research showed that 650,000 Australians participated in a conversation prompted by RU OK? Day. In 2010, that number reached two million, and I would be surprised if the number does not increase this year. This simple and effective campaign is the brainchild of a successful advertising executive, Gavin Larkin, who lost his own father 16 years ago to suicide. Many here will have seen Gav featured on this week's Australian Story with his son, Gus, and many others will know that Gav is not okay. Gav has advanced cancer and is currently receiving palliative care. I am sure that I can say that all of our thoughts go out to Gav and his family at this incredibly difficult time. I also imagine that his family must be very proud of the legacy that he has created through this campaign, because it is a campaign that will save lives.

  I am indebted to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for giving what I think is a very penetrating critique of why the opposition's polluters subsidy plan is destined for failure, because at the centre of it is bureaucrats trying to pick winners and donating taxpayer funds to companies which may well go bankrupt at the cost of $1,300 per year for Australian families.                     I was just going to make the point that, in contrast to the opposition's subsidies for polluters multibillion dollar slush fund, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be a body that is at arm's length from government, led by commercial leaders who will be making decisions on a commercial basis. The aim, of course, is to catalyse the development of clean energy in our economy. So we will be relying on the expertise of people from Australia's private sector to work on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and of course we will have some things to say about that over time as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is established.                 What is truly remarkable about this question, though, is the essence of the opposition's policy is that it believes it can take $1,300 per year from Australian families, put it in a slush fund and then dole it out to polluters, and, yes, that would have the consequences the Deputy Leader of the Opposition predicts.

  I would like to thank the member for Makin for his question. I know that he is interested in seeing 46,500 of his voters get a lift in their superannuation because the member for Makin knows that superannuation is about the future and avoiding the shock of finding you have insufficient money to retire on. That is why lifting superannuation is so important.                 In fact, it is a bit like the carbon tax. What we are doing on this side is making decisions for the long term. We are not putting off till tomorrow the problems that need to be solved today. Indeed, the government is proposing and is committed to introducing an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next six years. What we are trying to do is make sure that people can retire on at least 70 per cent of the income they had while they were working.                 We understand that Australians are living longer. You only have to look at the opposition frontbench to realise Australians are living longer! We want to make sure that older Australians have enough income to retire. We on this side know that nine per cent is not enough. That is why we are proposing to help fund the drop in Commonwealth tax revenue from putting more income from the marginal rate of taxation into concessionally taxed superannuation. We understand that that can be funded through the minerals resource rent tax. The minerals resource rent tax is fiscally responsible because it is making sure that all Australians have enough money to retire on. Of course, that is fiscal responsibility - in contrast to those opposite, who would dump rocket fuel on the hottest part of the economy and hand back billions of dollars to the richest companies in Australia in the mining sector.                 But we are not just lifting the superannuation rate from nine to 12 per cent. We are also seeking to lower the pressure of fees and charges on the money which goes into superannuation now for our strongest super reforms. What we are also trying to do is to eliminate unfair commissions paid to financial planners, making sure that there is as much money as possible available for people when they retire and it is not eaten up in unnecessary fees and charges.                 In fact, what we are doing is not just good for 10 million individuals and for lifting superannuation; it is good for the nation. There are not many things that Australia is fourth in the world in, but we are the fourth largest private funds under management sector in the world. This is not an accident; this is a contribution of Labor governments. And we intend to keep contributing to our economic independence. Isn't it about time, 223 years after Captain Cook came here, that we started to have some economic independence? That is what superannuation does.                   I was also asked in the question: are Australians adequately prepared for retirement? It will be good news to the House that nearly 30 in every 100 Australians already receive more than nine per cent now. This is good news. What we get on this side of the House is that it is not good enough that some people are able to look after themselves and leave everyone else behind. That is a very big difference. On this side of the House, even if the members of parliament are doing better than nine per cent, we are not going to vote against other people doing better. The shame of the opposition is that they get 15 per cent and they will not vote for that for their constituents. What hypocrisy.

  To the member who asked the question, first and foremost, this is a government that invests in capital for health care. We have a very proud record of doing that. I understand we have a record of doing that in the member's very own electorate, so we will continue to invest in health care -                      I do not like unanswered points about the government's record being left, Mr Speaker.                     I think it is important that people understand how much money we are investing in health care. Second, in relation to the member's question, as I have just explained in answer to the earlier question, this will not be a body where politicians are there picking winners. That is the opposition's plan. The government's plan is to accept the advice of scientists and to accept the advice of economists and to put a price on carbon, because that is the cheapest, most effective and efficient way of transforming our economy to a clean energy future.                     I was explaining the way in which the government's policy will work. At the centre of it, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, is not a system where politicians pick winners but a system where we have a board and management with commercial expertise which deals with projects on a commercial basis and ensures that they work to catalyse clean energy development in our economy.                 I understand the member has an interest in this. The member may want to study some of the projects that have already been supported through other government mechanisms and see what is being achieved, because that might give him an understanding of what can be achieved through a mechanism like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. For example, through our Solar Flagships program, in Chinchilla in Queensland we will see the development of a solar thermal power station which, if it were built today, would be the biggest in the world. It is that kind of clean energy development that will transform our economy. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will work commercially with commercial expertise to help with the transformation, but at the centre of the transformation is putting a price on carbon pollution, which is what economists have advised us is the cheapest way of cutting carbon pollution, creating clean energy jobs, transforming our economy and reaching the carbon pollution emission targets that are agreed on both sides of the parliament. I certainly do not want to see - and perhaps the member would not want to see either - Australian families slugged $1,300 a year to pay for the Leader of the Opposition's carbon plan.

  I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. The government has been determined to ensure that we have a full democratic process around the clean energy legislation. After 35 parliamentary reviews, after the Shergold report, after the Garnaut report and after the green and white papers on the CPRS, it is time now to act. On Tuesday we introduced the legislation into this House. Yesterday we commenced the second reading debate in this House. Also on Tuesday we set up a joint parliamentary committee that will allow scrutiny from outside of the parliament on the 19 critical bills before the parliament. Government and crossbench members in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have already been nominated to participate on that committee. As yet, not a single opposition member has been nominated to participate in that process. I hope that by the end of the day they take advantage and participate in that process.                     I was asked about what support there has been and what views there have been about the debate. There had been some issues about whether we had enough time to debate this legislation so this morning, after putting an appropriate motion on the Notice Paper,we had carried in the parliament a motion that we would sit next Tuesday between 9 am and 2 pm, without divisions, to allow an extra five hours of debate because we are determined to make sure that everyone can participate in this debate. We have also said that we would be prepared to sit at other times next week because again we want to make sure, as my learned colleague the member for Hunter has asked about, that all members can participate. Of course there have been some questions about the speakers list and who has a right to speak or not, but I am pleased indeed that, in spite of the fact -                      I am being totally relevant.                     It is called 'Leader of the House' for a reason. I am not just the leader of the government in the house; I am the Leader of the House. I am responsible for facilitating all members' rights in this House, a responsibility I take very seriously, whether they be members of the government, members of the crossbench or members of the opposition. There has been support for the action that we have taken. The Leader of the Opposition was asked whether the member for Wentworth was going to be speaking in the debate today and he said: 'Well, that's a matter for Malcolm; this debate will go over the next fortnight or so' -                      What I am indicating is that the government will ensure that every single member of this House, particularly the member for Wentworth, because I want to hear what he has to say, will have a right to participate in this debate. After saying we did not have enough time those opposite argued against the extra time.                     We will ensure that no-one has an excuse not to participate in this legislation.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is a serious question about a matter that is a serious issue in our national public policy debate and a serious question for our country. The processing of asylum seekers has featured in our politics for a very long period of time, well over a decade. During that period we have seen tragedy at sea, we have seen people get on to leaky boats, we have seen people pay money to people smugglers and give money to people who are preying on their desperation. I believe across this parliament people generally want to ensure that we do have an orderly migration system and that we are doing what we need to do to protect Australia's borders but that, at the same time, we are extending the compassion and concern that our nation has shown over many decades towards refugees - that is, that we honour our obligations under the refugee convention.                 During the course of today I did provide the Leader of the Opposition with some newly drafted amendments to the Migration Act. They are to achieve what the government set out to achieve after the High Court case - that is, they are to achieve a situation where executive government has the power to make the decisions it believes necessary in relation to offshore processing. The opposition received a legal briefing on Friday and a set of draft amendments were provided at that point. There are obviously a number of ways of achieving the same outcome. I have provided Leader of the Opposition with a new draft and I thank him for his consideration of that new draft.                 What we are talking about here is an issue that is of national importance and I believe Australians today are looking to this parliament to act and to show some resolution. I believe Australians are looking to this parliament to deal with these new amendments in a way that is not politics as usual. I believe the Australian nation is looking to us to deal with these new amendments in a way that is not politics as usual, in a way that resolves this issue and enables the nation to put it behind us. As we come to consider these new amendments, I believe that is what should be on the mind of every member of parliament. This issue is asking us to act in a way different to politics as usual and to seek some common ground.                 In providing these new amendments to the Leader of the Opposition today, we seek some common ground. The new amendments have been provided in the spirit of not pursuing politics as usual. The new amendments have been provided so our nation can put this issue behind us and move on, confident that executive government has the powers it needs to implement offshore processing as it sees fit but always in accordance with our obligations under the refugee convention.

  Can I say to the shadow minister, the objective of the government, and I hope it is shared as an objective of this parliament, is absolutely clear. It has been clear over a long period of time now, clear over many long months. That objective has been that we should take the most effective action possible to deter people from getting on leaky boats and from potentially risking their lives. We should take the most effective action possible to deter people from putting themselves in the hands of people smugglers who are seeking to profit from their misery. Our objective has been over many long months - apart from sending the most effective message of deterrence - that in designing a policy we should make sure that we are doing our best to protect Australia's borders but that, at the same time, we are doing our best to protect the values that Australians hold dear. And so at every stage the government has worked for effective deterrence and border protection coupled with honouring our obligations under the refugee convention. So when we entered into discussions with Malaysia, because we were advised and properly saw this as the most effective deterrence measure, we did it on the basis that our nation would always honour our obligations under the refugee convention. At its heart, the refugee convention is about not returning people to places where they would be persecuted, and the arrangement with Malaysia ensures that.                 It is also about making sure that people can have their claims processed, and the arrangement with Malaysia ensures that. It also goes through and ensures that people will have identification papers, that they would not be subject to the sanctions on illegal migrants, that they would have access to education and the ability to seek work. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has indicated that they are prepared to work on the implementation of this arrangement. That is because we have worked on this arrangement as a part of a regional solution, firstly, going to the big regional meeting in Bali to work on a regional framework, and that was agreed. Then this is the bilateral arrangement under the auspices of that framework.                 At the same time, in honouring our refugee conventions in this arrangement, we have ensured that we would extend our compassion to 4,000 more genuine refugees, people who are in Malaysia and have been there for years. I was asked about the government's objective.                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question went to what the Prime Minister describes the significant changes between last Friday and Monday and she is not addressing what has changed between last Friday and Monday.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was explaining what the government has always sought to achieve here. Then, when the High Court made its decision, which was unexpected, the government still seeks to achieve the same objectives that it wanted to achieve from the start. That now requires us to legislate and to amend the Migration Act to put beyond doubt that the executive government has the power to implement offshore processing arrangements.                 Now, there is inevitably more than one way to draft a set of amendments. When the opposition was briefed on Friday a draft set of amendments was provided, and when they were provided in the discussion in the meeting it was clear that there was more than one way of achieving this objective. The Leader of the Opposition expressed concern about some matters. In the new draft I believe he will see additional clarity on the matters about which he expressed concern. The Leader of the Opposition has said to me that he will now consider those amendments and I believe that to be highly appropriate.

We know that the most effective deterrent for boat journeys to Australia is to remove the product that people smugglers wish to sell, and that is the opportunity of settlement in Australia.                     That has been the consistent advice to this government and that advice has been provided to the opposition. The arrangement with Malaysia that this government has entered into achieves just that outcome. It provides for people to be returned to Malaysia for processing alongside the 90,000 other asylum seekers and refugees in Malaysia. It returns them to where the vast majority, well over 80 per cent, begin their boat journey to Australia - the country of Malaysia.                 There are sound policy and humanitarian reasons for supporting the processing of asylum seekers offshore when it is part of a sensible and well thought out regional framework. Importantly, our regional approach involves Australia playing more of a role in resettling refugees and assisting countries in the region towards more consistent standards and treatments. The Malaysia agreement delivers significant humanitarian and protection outcomes in the region.                  The honourable member for Chifley asked about the importance of protections and they are protections outlined in the Malaysian arrangement. The guarantee of non-refoulement, the guarantee of access to health and education and work rights as appropriate and the commitment to ensure access to processing are all outlined in the arrangement with Malaysia. There are two ways to deal with protections. You can negotiate them with the country involved, you can work them through, you can consult with the UNHCR or you can simply adopt the policy of turning boats around on the seas, which would not have those protections built in. It would be open to the government to adopt the policy of turning boats around on the high sea, which apart from being dangerous not only to asylum seekers but to Australian naval personnel would also result inevitably, where those boats are not sunk or sabotaged, in those boats being returned to Indonesia. Indonesia is not a signatory to the refugee convention. Anybody who is returned to Indonesia would have no protections guaranteed through negotiations with this government. They would have no guarantee of non-refoulement, no guarantee of work rights, no protections built in.                 If people are going to criticise protections built in with the Malaysian arrangement, it is appropriate that they also reflect on what the result would be of a policy of turning back boats, which is the policy of the opposition. It is the case that there are protections that can be built in with refugee signatory countries - Indonesia is not one of those - but I do note that being a refugee signatory country alone is not necessarily a guarantee of protection. For example, Afghanistan and Iran, our two largest source countries, are signatories. Iran is the country which the honourable member for Cook has proposed for a transfer agreement. But we on this side of the House would not see it having the appropriate protections in place.                 We want to ensure that this government and future governments have the power to be able to manage Australia's border protection policies. Without this legislation being proposed by the government, there is no confidence that we could have any effective offshore processing regime. The questions this week are: can the two major parties in this country, which both support offshore processing, reach an agreement to make it lawful? Will we reach an agreement for the policy that both sides of this House support? Will we have an effective and lawful offshore processing regime? And can we work in the national interest? They are the questions people in the region are waiting to see answered. On this side of the House, we are committed to doing so.

  To the Leader of the Opposition, he has misconstrued the point I was making in my last answer. He was asking me about a clause in the amendments that he has been provided with, and that clause was about assurances being gained between two countries which were not legally binding. That was his question to me. So I took his question to me to be: why would you want that in there; when would you use it?                 The government is seeking to use that clause with Malaysia. But I was pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition for policy consistency that it is the kind of clause that would have been necessary for the Howard government when it entered into its arrangement with Nauru had the High Court taken the same interpretation then that it takes now. When the Howard government entered into its arrangement with Nauru, Nauru was not a refugee convention signatory country. That is a fact. No shaking of anybody's head will wish that fact away. When the Howard government entered into the arrangement with Nauru, it was not a legislated arrangement in Australia or in Nauru. There was a memorandum of understanding between the two nations which spelt out obligations on each side - that is, it is a comparable situation. It was not the end point because it was for processing rather than for transfers. But, on those points, it is a comparable situation to where we are with Malaysia. It is not a refugee convention signatory country but we do have an arrangement with it which spells out obligations. That was the point of my last answer.                     I was directing my answer to that part of the Leader of the Opposition's question which went to my previous answer. He also asked me about the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General, in written advice on the question of Nauru that we have distributed, the opposition has and is publicly available, has said further information would be needed. He also pointed to the fact that there is legal risk. If you want to put it beyond doubt then you would amend the legislation. In addition to the general circumstances about Nauru, I would direct the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the Solicitor-General's advice which deals with the complex and difficult question of unaccompanied minors. He would need to direct his attention to that as well. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the grading he used for the Solicitor-General's opinion is not right. I would direct him to the two comprehensive pieces of legal advice which have been provided to the opposition and provided publicly.

  I thank the member for New England for his question. I thank him as well as many members of the Labor Party who have consistently raised with me over a long period of time the circumstances of regional students. Because of the advocacy of Labor members, the member for New England and the member for Lyne, in the last parliament the government acted to create a better and fairer system of youth allowance for Australian students generally and particularly for country students.                     In the 15 months since those new arrangements have been in operation, the statistics speak for themselves. I know these may be uncomfortable facts for the members of the opposition, but the fact is in the 15 months since these changes came into effect the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 26 per cent, an additional 7,400 students. There has also been an 18 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance, an additional 24,600. Those statistics are telling you that everyone has benefited, but country students have proportionally benefited more.                     This is against a backdrop where under the Howard government the percentage of regional students and country students in Australian universities was going down. We acted to improve youth allowance for regional students. I am pleased to be in a position to say that we will act again to improve the circumstances of country students in getting access to university.                     That is because we want country students to be able to go to university. We do not want to see the sorts of statistics that the Howard government used to think were fine, where the participation of country students was going down.                 The government will devote $265 million to deliver on a package to eliminate regional eligibility distinctions for youth allowance from 1 January 2012. Inner regional students will be able to access independent youth allowance in the same way as outer regional, remote and very remote students. The government is also providing further support for eligible students as they face additional barriers to accessing higher education and often have more limited access options. The government will increase to $2,000 both second and third year relocation scholarships for eligible regional university students required to live away from home. This represents a $900 increase in relocation scholarship payments for each of those two years. We expect that these new measures will continue to improve the support for students in regional areas. It will allow approximately 5,500 inner regional students to access payments or receive upward variation in their income support payments and provide about 15,000 regional students with higher relocation scholarship amounts each year.                 I am pleased to be able to report to the House that on top of a proud track record of better support for country students, we are improving that support again.

  I thank the member for Petrie for that question because there is ongoing instability in the global economy and it is likely that these headwinds will be with us for some time yet. Despite these circumstances, the fundamentals in the Australian economy are strong, and they are almost unique among all developed economies. Unlike other developed economies, we avoided recession. We have grown our economy by over five per cent from its precrisis level, whilst countries like the United States are still struggling to get back to where they were before the global financial crisis. We have also created something like three-quarters of a million jobs, whereas elsewhere in the global economy you have seen something like 30 million jobs lost. We have an unprecedented investment pipeline, something like $430 billion in resources alone. And we are bringing our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. These are all strengths which should be valued. Of course, they will help us ride out the instability that we see in the global economy.                 It makes it more important that we build on these strengths during these times of global uncertainty. It makes it more important that we have fiscally responsible policies in place. It also makes it more important that all election commitments are fully costed. That is why it is so important that we have an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. I thank those on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House that recommended an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. Great work was done by both sides of the House to put in place a process in which all members of the House could have confidence. There was bipartisan support for the Parliamentary Budget Office, so that in the future there could be no excuses for parties not to have their election commitments fully costed. There would be no excuse in the future for things like the $11 billion black hole, the costings con job that was foisted on the Australian people during the last election campaign.                 The Parliamentary Budget Office is critical for transparency around policy costings. It is all about making sure that these are open and public, not secret as the Liberal Party is now trying to achieve, because it has rejected the model of the Parliamentary Budget Office. Why has it rejected this model that its members in this House recommended? The fact is it has a $70 billion crater in its budget estimates. That is why there has been this backflip and it is now rejecting a Parliamentary Budget Office. A Parliamentary Budget Office is important to strengthen our fiscal framework. It is important to budget responsibility and to facing the future. When it comes to the Parliamentary Budget Office, 'No,' is not the answer.

  We have provided the amendments, and they enable the minister for immigration to make a determination about offshore processing. In order to make that determination the minister would need to turn his mind to the national interest and, specifically, to two points in particular: the honouring of the central obligation of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees that people were not being taken to places from which they would be returned to a place of persecution; and that those asylum seekers could have their claims processed. That is what these new amendments provide.                 To the opposition generally, we have provided these new amendments today -                      The amendments are there for the opposition to see. Regarding the opposition's consideration of these amendments, they would put the minister for immigration in this government in the same position that the minister for immigration was when, under the Howard government, a determination was made to take people to Nauru, not then a signatory country to the refugee convention. No legislation was in place in Nauru. What was in place was a memorandum of understanding between governments. If, when the opposition was sitting on the government benches, that was viewed as perfectly satisfactory for them, I do find it a bit odd that now they are sitting on the opposition benches it is apparently no longer perfectly satisfactory for them. Those were the circumstances with Nauru.                     There is no amount of shaking of heads or interjecting that will change that fact. That is the history. That is what the Howard government did.                     It is true.                     At the end of the day what we are seeking to achieve with these amendments, despite all of this contradiction about the clear history, is a circumstance where the government of the day has the ability to put offshore processing beyond legal doubt. We have provided amendments because I believe Australians are looking to us to find some common ground and to act in good faith so that we as a nation can put this issue behind us and have legal certainty. I do genuinely believe that. The reason we provided the amendments today was that we believe the Australian people are looking to us to go beyond politics as usual. I hope that in considering these amendments, which are in the national interest, we can find the common ground in this parliament which enables us to go beyond politics as usual and to put offshore processing beyond doubt.                 I cannot forecast every permutation and combination of governments to come, but it may be that a government in the future wants to do exactly what the Howard government did when it had processing on Nauru in exactly the same circumstances - a non-refugee convention signatory country and a memorandum of understanding. I ask those opposite: why would they want to deny a future government the power they sought for themselves and used themselves when they were in government?

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The passage of the clean energy bills is extremely important in providing certainty for households and businesses. For the business community in particular the carbon price will provide the certainty to allow businesses to make the investments that are necessary, particularly in important parts of the economy like the energy sector. The carbon price creates the incentive for investments in low-emission technologies, and in energy efficiency and renewable energy, that will help drive productivity in our economy in the future. There is growing evidence internationally that companies that reduce the emissions intensity of their businesses are more competitive and do deliver better shareholder value. Last week, in fact, the Carbon Disclosure Project released its 10th annual report. The Carbon Disclosure Project is an independent organisation holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world, and it examined the climate change policies of the world's largest 500 companies and found that companies with the sharpest focus on climate change have rewarded their investors with double the average rate of return - double the average rate of return amongst those of the 500 largest companies internationally that are focusing on reducing the emissions intensity of their businesses.                 Households, of course, will have the certainty that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance for the modest cost-of-living impact of introducing a carbon price. Almost six million households will receive assistance that meets or exceeds their expected average price impact, and no fewer than four million households - almost half of all households - will receive assistance that provides a 20 per cent buffer over and above their expected average price impacts. They will be better off.                 In addition to that, all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 a year will get a tax cut, and most will receive at least $300 a year when we increase the tax-free threshold from around $6,000 at present to $18,200. Further to that, all families receiving family tax benefits will receive extra payments worth up to $110 per child, and all pensioners will receive a pension increase worth $338 for singles and $510 for couples combined. Those are very important elements of the clean energy bills that are before the House at this point in time. This is very important certainty for households and for business.                 Yesterday the member for North Sydney confirmed, of course, that the coalition intends repealing the legislation and, in doing so, will take away all of that certainty for businesses and households - in particular, though, with very clear and specific comments that the coalition will take away the pension increases, will take away the increases to family tax benefits and will put up taxes. The member for North Sydney said, 'We have said that you don't need to have compensation if you don't have a carbon tax.' They are going to take away the tax cuts. They are going to take away the pension increases. They are going to take away the family tax benefits.                     We all know the truth about this - that is, they have no interest in helping families and households. They have only got interest in their own political wellbeing, and that is it.

  I thank the shadow minister for the question. As I have made clear in parliament over a number of days as we have discussed this matter, we are determined to implement the arrangement with Malaysia because the advice to us is that it would have the maximum deterrence effect. The advice to us - and this advice has been shared with the opposition - is that it would have the maximum deterrence effect. The advice to us is that Nauru would not have that deterrence effect, and that advice has been shared with the opposition.                 Can I also say to the shadow minister who asked the question: at the end of the day, whether you determine that Malaysia is the best way forward or, as those opposite have determined, that Nauru is the best way forward, what will come before this parliament and the amendments that I have given the Leader of the Opposition today are not specific about Nauru. They are not specific about Malaysia. They are about empowering government to act.                   The shadow minister who asked the question obviously does believe that Nauru is the best solution. I would refer him not only to the Solicitor-General's advice but to the advice of respected commentators like Ron Merkel QC: 'In respect of both Nauru and PNG, there must be great doubt that a declaration by the minister would be valid.' He is obviously saying you need to legislate. Stephen Estcourt QC said, 'Any declaration of Nauru or PNG under section 198A(3) would, notwithstanding the obvious points of distinction, likely meet the same fate as the recently invalidated declaration with respect to Malaysia.' International law expert Professor Don Rothwell said:                 _ offshore processing in Malaysia, as per the High Court's decision, and in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, would not be legally permissible.                 Finally there are the views of the shadow Attorney-General, who provides advice to the opposition and who on radio said this -                      The shadow Attorney-General said on radio:                 No, let _ let me _ let me put this in my own words: that if Nauru were to make itself compliant with all its obligations under Section 198 - sorry, under the UN Refugee Convention and Section 198a of the Australian Migration Act - then the Nauru solution would work. But I do acknowledge that there is a sufficient area of doubt that it would be prudent and desirable to put the matter beyond doubt by legislative change.                 I frequently do not agree with the shadow Attorney-General, but I do agree with that. The proposition that will come before this parliament is a proposition about amending the Migration Act. We have a view about Malaysia. The opposition has a view about Nauru. That is as it may be, but the proposition that will come before the parliament, in the words of Senator Brandis, is a proposition that would be prudent to pass even if the eventual aim was processing in Nauru. That is what the Leader of the Opposition needs to consider. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for meeting with me today and I thank him for indicating that the opposition is considering the amendments that have been provided to them today.

  I would like to thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She understands that 49,500 of her voters stand to benefit by increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. This is a very important issue. Australians are living longer than ever before - no jokes about the opposition frontbench today! - and it is important that we make sure that people do not retire poor.                     It is important that we finish the job started -                      by Prime Minister Keating and Bill Kelty to lift superannuation beyond nine per cent. Twenty years later, we should finish the job that has been started.                 We want to improve the retirement savings of Australians by decreasing the fees and charges that are exacted upon the income in their superannuation accounts. We also want to make sure that there is an adequate replacement for the tax which the Commonwealth will no longer be receiving by moving so much income from income tax into the concessional tax treatment of superannuation.                 That is why the MRRT is such an important tax for this country. We believe on this side of the House that some of the profits of Australia's richest companies who are doing very well, who are setting the Guinness World Recordsfor their profits, should be shared in a multi-speed economy. What could be better for Australians than increasing the retirement savings of 8Â½ million working people? What could be better than making sure that people have a dignified and financially adequate retirement?                 Indeed, the challenge was issued to Mr Abbott and the opposition as late as today by the Daily Telegraph, which said that older people are working longer because they do not have enough. We need to do better in this country, and this parliament is capable of doing better. I understand very well that some of those opposite are not worried about whether or not enough other people have enough to retire on because they are all right; they have 15 per cent. Why would the Leader of the Opposition be worried about the retirement savings of 55,000 of his voters when he has a generous pension scheme?                 It is only thanks to Labor in the last 20 years that the average account balance for men in Australia is at $71,000. It still lags at $41,500 for women in Australia - this is not enough. The current retirement savings system is not enough when men hold 63 per cent of all account balances in Australia and women only hold 37 per cent.                 But why should we be surprised that this mob on the other side do not want the average punter to lift their balance, because they have put the claws -                      We want to improve the retirement savings of 8Â½ million Australians. Yet those opposite say no to the Parliamentary Budget Office, they say no to the minerals resource rent tax, they say no to increasing superannuation -                      If they do not like what they are hearing perhaps I might conclude by referring to that well-known film Robin Hood. In Robin Hood, once upon a time, the hero was Robin Hood. But this crew, like the Sheriff of Nottingham, take from the poor and give to the rich.

  I thank the member for his question. Obviously the refugee obligations are important to us. They are important to this country. When we deal with countries that not only are signatory to the convention but are implementing the convention, we can be sure that convention obligations are being abided by. Through the remarkable negotiating strategy of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, we are now in a position to say refugee convention obligations - most important of all, the obligation of non-refoulement, of making sure that people are not returned to a place of persecution - can be achieved in Malaysia. In addition to that we can see in Malaysia the processing of claims and we can see people's humanitarian needs dealt with. The member, I accept, is genuinely interested in this. I accept that genuine interest. I say to him and to the Leader of the Opposition, and anyone else opposite, that if they are concerned about these questions I recommend that they ring the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, ask them their attitude to the Malaysia arrangement and ask them their attitude to Nauru. I think if those opposite bothered to make that call what they would find is that the UNHCR is prepared to be involved in implementing the arrangement with Malaysia, whereas the UNHCR is not prepared to be involved, in any way, in - indeed it is quite condemning of - an arrangement with Nauru. For those who are concerned - I accept that there are many genuinely concerned about our obligations under the refugee convention - I suggest they ring the United Nations agency charged with making that convention live and breathe and ask them about the alternative propositions here: Malaysia versus Nauru.                 But let me come back to what I have said at other points in question time and what I said consistently last week, which is that at the end of the day this is not a debate between two contending policy propositions; this is a debate about whether or not executive government should have the power it needs to make the arrangements it believes fit.                     At the end of the day the legislation that will come before the parliament is not about Malaysia and it is not about Nauru; it is about executive government having the power to determine the offshore processing arrangements it believes are appropriate. I say to members opposite, who now apparently have a new-found love for the refugee convention, that members opposite made arrangements to process asylum seekers on Nauru when it was not signatory to the refugee convention. It may be that some time in the future a government wants to go down a comparable path to the path that the Howard government went down when it initiated processing in Nauru - that is, a non-signatory country, and that is relying on a memorandum of understanding.                 My point to those opposite is that if it was good enough for them to seek to have that power and to exercise it in government, what on earth can justify denying it to this government or governments in the future through a proper amendment to the Migration Act? This proper amendment to the Migration Act deals with core obligations under the refugee convention.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and indeed for her ongoing commitment and support for public transport, particularly for people in Western Sydney. This is a government that has committed more for urban public transport than was committed by all governments between Federation and 2007. Part of that commitment, of course, was to the Parramatta-Epping rail link, which the state government, in their budget a few weeks ago, walked away from. They walked away from that commitment in spite of the fact that it had some support from over there, sometimes, but consistent support from all those on this side of the House.                  Of course, the member for Parramatta would know that the government of New South Wales also walked away from the $4 billion of state funding which had been committed for the Western Express line. That would have been of great benefit for all residents west of Parramatta on that line.                 We are committed to public transport as part of our commitment to dealing with climate change. One of the benefits of increased use of public transport is that it lowers our carbon footprint by lowering our emissions. So this is a vital economic reform but is also vital for our environment.                  I am asked about what modelling has been done. Of course, the government is ensuring that for any increased prices there is full and proper assistance given. Indeed, greater assistance will be given than the cost. Treasury modelling shows that there will be a modest impact of some 0.5 per cent on public transport.                 In order to provide assistance nine out of every 10 households will receive assistance in the form of tax cuts or higher payments and there will also be direct assistance in terms of increased pensions and increased assistance for those on benefits. Compare that with the impact of the GST. The impact on public transport fares was some eight per cent - that is, eight per cent under the GST; 0.5 per cent under the carbon pricing. This carbon pricing relates to just a few cents on the ticket price for most public transport services. For example, a ticket from Parramatta to Central would have an increase of 2c or 3c.                  I was asked about modelling that has been done. I was very surprised to see an exaggerated claim in the Daily Telegraph! The federal opposition - Tony Abbott's office - and the Office of the New South Wales Premier got together to cook up some outcomes. An email from Peter Grimshaw, copied to the Premier, said:                 The 'Tele' is very keen to do a story for tomorrow's paper on the impact of the carbon tax ...                     I am very clearly about the modelling for the price impact. What the email of 14 July said was this: 'Juicy quotes from the department of transport's brief. Note that there are some not so helpful quotes in the brief too.' You bet there were. What the department of transport's brief said was, 'The introduction of the carbon tax is not expected to have any measurable effect in people's choice regarding public transport or private car use.' NSW Treasury found, 'The impact, in terms of price impact, was 0.49 per cent,' exactly what our federal Treasury modelling showed, and that the impact would be miniscule. It is important in the debate about our clean energy future that people stick to the facts, not to making up figures.

  To the member who asked the question: I answered this question on a number of occasions last week. We have designed the arrangement with Malaysia because we have been advised it has the maximum deterrence effect; that is, it sends a very clear message to people smugglers and to the people that are preyed on by people smugglers that they can spend all of their money - their money gets taken away by a people smuggler - and they do not end up in Australia being processed for resettlement in Australia. We have the clearest possible advice that this sends the strongest deterrence message possible. So in designing -                      In designing this arrangement with Malaysia, relying on the best possible advice, we have accepted the advice that it is the strongest possible deterrence message. In being the strongest possible deterrence message our aim is that we send such a strong signal to people smugglers, effectively smashing their business model, that we do not see all of the 800 spots used because transfers send that very strong message - that if you spend your money, risk your life, you do not end up where you wanted to go. Consequently, that is the advice that has informed Malaysia, that is the policy that has informed the arrangement with Malaysia. But I say again to those opposite, I understand that they will continue to criticise the arrangement with Malaysia and in this House of parliament obviously people will come and put all different sorts of views on public policy questions. That is understood. We will in this parliament, though, be debating a different question. That different question is whether or not executive government should have the power to process asylum seekers offshore or whether all of that should be put at risk.                 We believe that we should amend the Migration Act so that we can do that processing offshore. I also believe that with the new amendments I have supplied to the Leader of the Opposition today the eyes of the Australian community are upon us; that Australians in dealing with these new amendments want to see us go beyond politics as usual. Australians want us to resolve this issue and put it behind us. Australians want us to find the common ground necessary to get this done.

  I thank the member for Page for her question as she understands very well this government's commitment to older Australians and the importance of the age pension. It is the case that this government has delivered historic reforms to the age pension, boosting both the amount of the pension and, just as importantly, making sure that the pension keeps up with pensioners' costs of living.                 From tomorrow, pensioners will receive their fourth increase to the pension since we introduced the historic reforms just two years ago. We delivered pension increases of $148 a fortnight for single pensioners and $146 a fortnight for couples combined over the last two years. These are very significant improvements to the pension that this side of the parliament delivered. We know that the other side of the parliament refused to deliver an increase to the pension. We are of course also delivering real and permanent increases to the pension through our plan to put a price on carbon pollution. This too will mean improvements to the pension. Under our plan, it will be the big polluters who pay for their pollution, not pensioners. Pensioners will not be paying; it will be the big polluters. So we will see 3.4 million pensioners receiving an improvement to their pensions - yet again, from this side of the parliament - that more than covers their average expected price rises. Once again, pensioners will receive assistance worth $338 for singles and $255 a year for each member of a couple. These are the changes that pensioners can look forward to - increases to their pension that they know will come from this side of the parliament. It is not just these annual changes; they can also be assured that the clean energy supplement will keep up with the cost of living. So it is this side of the parliament that is making sure that pensioners are looked after.                 What can pensioners expect from those opposite? I was asked what the impact would be of not providing the support, and we have heard from those opposite that -                      it is their intent to claw back the assistance that this government will provide to those opposite. What that will mean in real terms, to real pensioners -                      is $338 less.                     Pensioners do have the right to know what will be the implications for them, the impact on them and their budgets, of this Leader of the Opposition's -                      decision to take $338 a year out of their persons and wallets.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, let me make clear the obligations that are in the agreement. Asylum seekers transferred from Australia will be there with the permission and agreement of the Malaysian government. They will have legal authority to remain in Malaysia, they will have the opportunity to have their asylum claims considered and Malaysia will not send any refugees back to persecution in their countries of origin - that is, they are upholding the central tenets of the refugee convention by not returning people to places of persecution and by processing their claims. Transferees will be issued with identification documents which will be endorsed by the Malaysian authorities and which will identify to the Malaysian government that the transferee is lawfully in Malaysia. They will not be subject to any of the penalties imposed on illegal immigrants. There will be arrangements allowing those transferred -                      I did want to make the obligations under the arrangement clear. There are obligations allowing those transferred to work and children to get an education. The UNHCR, the United Nations agency charged with upholding the refugee convention, will also assist transferees to access services and undertake refugee status determinations. And, to ensure the ongoing welfare of transferees, there will be an oversight body that will include representatives of UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration, as well as Australian and Malaysian officials.                 I say to the Leader of the Opposition: they are the obligations that Malaysia has freely entered into in this arrangement between us. The Malaysian government has done this freely. The Malaysian government has done it freely because it stands ready to implement it. The Leader of the Opposition has no evidence available to him - no evidence whatsoever - to suggest that the Malaysian government will not honour the obligations it has freely entered into. The Leader of the Opposition says that the only thing that ever compels anybody to do anything is legal compulsion. Well, I actually believe that, in the real world, decent people who freely enter into agreements that have obligations in them do that because they genuinely intend to meet their obligations. The Malaysian government has done that, and I think this sort of casual insulting of the government of Malaysia is not proper and not of assistance to us or to our role in the region.                 I say to the Leader of the Opposition as well - and he needs to think about this - that the opposition in the past, when it was in government and indeed when it has been in opposition, has talked about things like towing boats back to Indonesia. Now, there are all the practical difficulties of that, all the risk of loss of life at sea - and the fact that Indonesia is not a signatory country. Indonesia has not entered into an arrangement of this nature with Australia. So how can the Leader of the Opposition say that that is satisfactory but this arrangement with Malaysia is not?                 But, at the end of the day, I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to resolve all of those conundrums and questions. But I am asking him to do what he said he would do earlier today when I met with him, which is consider the amendments that I have presented to him - those amendments being amendments which would enable executive government to act to have offshore processing and to do that in a way which is beyond legal risk.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question, and I know his commitment to regional Australia. He advocated strongly for his community in this first round of Regional Development Australia funds. These funds came from the government's commitment when it formed office to put significant new resources into the regions. That was delivered on in our first budget, where $4.3 billion was committed to the regions specifically and $1 billion over the course of the next four years was committed to the Regional Development Australia Fund.                 The first round of that fund was announced a couple of weeks ago and it received an overwhelming response from both sides of the parliament. Indeed, I have much correspondence from many who sit opposite, quite apart from the great interest that was taken on this side of the House. The members for Herbert, Riverina, Farrer, Gippsland, Goldstein and Sturt all wrote to us asking that proper consideration be given to their particular proposals. The fact is that, whilst the first round was significantly oversubscribed - and there were many in the process that were ineligible because they had not complied with the procedures, and they will get important advice as to how make applications in the future - we increased the payment in round 1 from $100 million to $150 million to accommodate more of these good projects coming forward.                 We have also said that we are reinforcing through the guidelines the importance of what we are seeking to achieve, and that is the leveraging of funding - not just through Commonwealth funds but also through state governments, local governments and community groups. We want the proposals that stack up and make a difference in terms of the economic and social diversification within the region. The member for Blair was successful in his advocacy for one of the projects in his region in relation to the Somerset Civic Centre. This is really important to the Esk community because, as it rebuilds, coming out of the devastating floods, this commitment to liveability and community amenity is terribly important.                 I am asked also what the future opportunities are. They can be significant. We will be announcing the opening of the second round in November and thereafter we intend for there to be three more rounds before the next election. But those additional rounds will only occur if this House passes the mining resource rental tax. That is a circumstance in which this government is seeking to take the proceeds of the mining boom, from resources that are owned by the Australian people and where there are super profits being made, to reinvest back into our community. The Assistant Treasurer has indicated that part of that will go to super and other parts are going to go to company tax cuts across the board so that we can diversify the economic base out of this resources boom. Some of it will go to infrastructure, including social infrastructure.                 That is what is in prospect. I say to all of those members over there urging me that consideration should be given for their electorates and their projects: think carefully about the folly that you are pursuing in this blind saying of no by the Leader of the Opposition. There is a price for saying no. The price of saying no is to deny regions the ability to build themselves, build with confidence, diversify their economic base and sustain their communities. Don't say no; stick up for the regions - because we will.

  I refer the shadow minister to the obligations and agreement between Australia and Malaysia. I particularly refer him to the fact that there will be an oversight body that will include representatives of the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration as well as Australian and Malaysian officials. I also say to him: on what evidence does he suggest that Malaysia will not honour the obligations that it has freely entered into? On what evidence does he suggest that?                 We are talking about the government of a nation in our region that was under no obligation to enter into this arrangement with Australia. No-one made Malaysia enter this agreement; it freely chose to do so. The fact that it freely chose to do so should, I think, be taken as indicative of its intentions. Why would it have entered into an agreement if it did not intend to abide by the clauses in it? There was no pressure on it to enter into this arrangement, other than wanting to assist with arrangements in our region. I would also say to the shadow minister: why does he believe UNHCR is willing to implement this arrangement? Why does he believe that -                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      To the shadow minister who asked the question - he may need to explain this to the Australian parliament and to the Australian people - the United Nations agency charged with upholding the convention, the United Nations agency that works around the world to assist asylum seekers and refugees, has said that it is prepared to work to implement this arrangement with Malaysia. That is obviously the United Nations agency charged with the welfare of refugees and the refugee convention saying that they can see that there is some merit in this arrangement and that they are prepared to be involved in implementing it. Clearly, they have not come to an adverse conclusion about the Malaysian government freely honouring the obligations it has taken unto itself. If the UNHCR has not come to that adverse conclusion, why has the shadow minister?                 Why does the shadow minister come into this place and say he is motivated by concern for refugees, and yet he advocates a solution that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the body charged with upholding the convention, will not involve itself in - that is, he advocates Nauru.                 The UNHCR has been very clear that they will not be involved in Nauru. I would suggest that the shadow minister should take a step back from the politics and look at this arrangement, look at what UNHCR is saying and actually examine his conscience as to whether he has any reason in the world to be asserting, as he does in this place and publically, that the Malaysian government will not honour its obligations. But once again, at the end of the day - even if the shadow minister has gone through that process of reflection and he is able to rationalise the fact that UNHCR is going to be involved in implementing the Malaysia agreement, and he is able to rationalise the fact that he has no reason to assume the Malaysian government will not honour its obligations, and if he is able to rationalise the fact that under the Howard government they took asylum seekers to non-refugee countries, and if he is able to rationalise the fact that that happened without a legislative foundation stone; that is, the agreement with Nauru was through an MOU and boats were taken back to Indonesia with no arrangements about the convention and no arrangements about protection - if he is able to rationalise all of those conundrums and contradictions and still publically go out and say, 'I argue for Nauru', well, that is a question for him; this is about amending the legislation.

  I thank the member for Holt for his question. I also acknowledge his longstanding interest in the Australia-United States bilateral relationship and his interest in our alliance with the United States. The Australia-United States ministerial consultation, or AUSMIN as it is generally known, took place in San Francisco on Wednesday and Thursday of last week. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I represented Australia; the Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, and the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, represented the United States. The Australian delegation included the Chief of the Defence Force, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.                 The ministerial consultations took place at the Presidio in San Francisco, the scene of the signing of the ANZUS treaty on 1 September 1951. So the context of the meeting was the 60th anniversary of an alliance which has served both the United States and Australia well. It also coincided with the 10th anniversary of the first invoking of the ANZUS treaty in the aftermath of September 11, and underscored the point that this is an alliance which has served us well for 60 years and that continues to adapt to modern challenges.                 The drafters of the treaty would not have envisaged that the first invocation of the treaty would have been against a non-state actor, against a non-nation state, in the face of international terrorism. Indeed, the AUSMIN meeting declared that the treaty itself could be invoked in the modern day in the face of a cyberattack, again something that the drafters and signatories of the treaty would not have envisaged. We have acknowledged that in the modern day a substantial cyberattack degrading, denuding or destroying the communications system of a country - the degrading, denuding or destroying of communications and military communications systems of Australia or the United States - could in theory invoke the treaty. As Leon Panetta and I had said, this needs to be understood as a battleground for the future, not just for nation states but for industry and commerce as well.                 As the communique outlines, we dealt not just with that modern challenge but also with a series of modern challenges, including space and space awareness, ballistic missile defence and the emergence in this century of the Asia-Pacific century - the growth of China, the rise of India, the rise and growth of the ASEAN economies combined, the ongoing importance of Japan and the republic of Korea - underlining the importance of the United States's engagement in the Asia-Pacific, which has been a source of stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific since the end of World War II.                 In that context, as we did in Melbourne at the 2010 AUSMIN meeting in Melbourne, we discussed the United States Global Force Posture Review. A lot of work has been done in the intervening 12 months to better understand the potential for Australia and the United States to become even more deeply engaged so far as operational matters are concerned - training, exercises, access to ports and facilities, prepositioning of stores and the like. There is more work to be done on this front, but this is a very important development so far as our operational cooperation with the United States is concerned.                 We also spoke about our immediate challenge in Afghanistan - shared assessment that we continue to be on track for transition by 2014 and commenced the discussion of the post-transition presence by the United States, Australia and the international community.                 I also had the opportunity to speak to the Secretary of Defense about some capability issues, including the Joint Strike Fighter, C17s and submarines. This was a most successful and productive meeting amongst friends. This is an alliance which has served us well for 60 years and will continue to serve us well into the future.

  There is a very clear reason for that: the government has been advised that it will not work and that it will cost $1 billion, and I am not intending to waste $1 billion of taxpayers' money on an outcome that we have been advised will not work. The Leader of the Opposition takes constant reckless attitudes to taxpayers' money. That is how he has got himself into a $70 billion black hole. Presumably, he now wants to make that a $71 billion black hole. But, as the Leader of the Opposition knows because we have made the relevant briefings available to him, we have the clearest possible advice from the same experts who advised the Howard government that Nauru will not work and that it is an incredibly costly solution costing up to $1 billion.                 The Leader of the Opposition has come in today with this fig leaf because he knows that the Australian people can see that, when he was challenged yesterday to rise above the politics of the moment and deal with an issue in the national interest, he was apparently unable to deal with a question in the national interest. Given a choice yesterday between the nation's interest - that is, working to ensure that our nation can process asylum seekers offshore - or taking his narrow political interest, he chose his narrow political interest over the national interest. I think Australians are looking at this parliament and at the Leader of the Opposition, and Australians want to see us work together to ensure that there can be offshore processing and work together beyond politics-as-usual to resolve this issue and put it behind us. The Leader of the Opposition in turning his back is not turning his back on me; he is turning his back on the nation's interest. He ought not to do that. He should reconsider the reckless path he set himself on yesterday.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. It invites me to talk about the government's policies for offshore processing. It also invites me to talk about the process the government has been involved in, particularly since the High Court case was announced. Since the High Court case was announced, the government has worked to bring legislation to this parliament which would enable executive government to make decisions about offshore processing - that is, to bring legislation to this parliament that would give this government and future governments the same freedom of action the Howard government had when it determined that it would have asylum seekers transferred to PNG and Nauru - one of those countries being a refugee signatory country and one of those countries not being a refugee signatory country.                 In the process since, we have sought to keep the opposition advised and informed. First there was a question of what the High Court case meant. So the government obtained the opinion of the Solicitor-General on the High Court case - in fact, two separate opinions: its meaning in general and its meaning in relation to unaccompanied minors - and released them publicly. At that time, the Leader of the Opposition was saying, 'If the government have legal advice, let them release it,' and we did. Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that he was trying to work with me at that point:                 I am trying to give her -                  the Prime Minister -                  the chance to give this country a border protection policy. The ball is in her court, I hope she'll return it.                 Then I wrote offering a briefing and the Leader of the Opposition wrote back saying he would like to have that briefing, and it was made available for him in Brisbane at his request.                     Then, having facilitated that briefing, the Leader of the Opposition sought a briefing on the legislation, so we made that available at his request in Melbourne on Friday evening. Then he demanded publicly a meeting between him and me to discuss this question, and we facilitated that request and had the meeting yesterday. Then, out of that meeting, the Leader of the Opposition said he would consider the new amendments the government had put to him, new amendments which were worked through because he, amongst others, had expressed concerns about the question of protections. At every stage the government has sought to work with the opposition and to give the opposition its ability to work in the national interest. At every stage we have sought to put the politics to one side and to work with the opposition on restoring to executive government the powers it needs for offshore processing.                 We have responded to every utterance of the Leader of the Opposition. A policy briefing - he wanted it; it was given. A legal briefing - he wanted it; it was given. A meeting with me - he wanted it; it was given. Amendments to the legislation on better protections - we worked on those amendments and those amendments were made.                 In response to all of that and in complete denial of the national interest, the Leader of the Opposition went out yesterday and announced that he was on a strategy to end offshore processing in this country. He made that announcement publicly with no advice to me, no coming back to the government and no genuine intention to ever work in the national interest. All of this conduct by the Leader of the Opposition is because he has judged his political interest in front of the national interest. He is terrified that the Malaysia arrangement will work and that is not in his political interest. He wants to see more boats.

  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows the answer to that question. Perhaps she might want to supply the answer to the question: how many asylum seekers will not be processed offshore because of the reckless negativity of this opposition? You are right: on the strategy you are wrong. The opposition stands for zero when it comes to offshore -                    The member for Mitchell then left the chamber -

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. The government's response to the High Court decision is to legislate to give the government of the day the ability to act in the national interest. This week the parliament had an opportunity, an opportunity to work together in the national interest -                      an opportunity to send the clearest possible message to people smugglers that, although the two sides of the House may have their differences, although we may disagree about methods and about tactics, we agree that people smugglers should not be able to run the migration program into Australia. It was an opportunity to send the message that we would act as one in the national interest and an opportunity to send the message that we would act to provide a disincentive for people making the dangerous boat journey to come to Australia. But instead what we see is more politics as usual from the Leader of the Opposition.                 The government believes that the Malaysia arrangement is in the national interest, because all our advice tells us that it would be the most effective deterrent to making the dangerous boat journey - and that advice has been provided to the opposition. If the opposition wilfully ignore this advice, the Australian people are entitled to conclude that the opposition have done so simply because they are afraid it will work. They are afraid it will work - and they will stop at nothing in their own political interest. They are afraid it would not be in their political interest for this to happen.                 I am asked about the importance of non-refoulement in the border protection policy. It is a very important and fundamental tenet of the refugee convention. That is why we have painstakingly negotiated non-refoulement clauses into the Malaysia agreement. It is important that any arrangements entered into by Australia reflect that importance. That is one of the reasons this government has rejected the policy of turning back boats on the high seas. There are some in this House who say it is okay to send boats to Indonesia with no protections negotiated but it is not okay to send planes to Malaysia with protections negotiated. That is another reason the Australian people are entitled to conclude that what we are seeing from this Leader of the Opposition is cheap opportunism and hypocrisy, because his opportunism and hypocrisy speak for themselves. The cheap and feeble excuse from the opposition for this inconsistency -                      is: 'Oh, it's a different section of the act which governs turning back the boats.' And they are right - nobody has suggested it is the same section of the act - but it would be open for the Leader of the Opposition to walk into the House today and move an amendment to that section of the act to say: 'If you turn back a boat, you could only point it towards a refugee convention signatory country.' It would be open to the member for Warringah to do that today. Are we going to see that, Tony? Are you going to move that amendment today or will we see more cheap hypocrisy from you?                     Will we see more cheap hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition? Let the honourable Leader of the Opposition stand at the dispatch box with his hand on his heart and say that he stayed awake at night worrying about the people we sent to Nauru, because they were not going to a refugee convention signatory country. Let him stand at the dispatch box and argue that it is okay to send people to Zimbabwe, the Republic of Congo and Iran, as the member for Cook would like to do, because they are refugee convention signatory countries. We all know the Leader of the Opposition is a weathervane, but the weathervane always points to his own political interest and not the national interest.

  Thank you very much. The answer to the member's question is: I have been advised, and I am relying on that advice, that Nauru will not work and will cost a billion dollars. The people who live in the member's electorate may want to pay more tax to fund a failed solution that the Leader of the Opposition has been directly advised will not work. The member might want to go to families in his community and say, 'Do you mind paying a billion dollars more tax so the Leader of the Opposition can put into place a processing centre on Nauru that he has been told will not work?' You may want to do that, but can I suggest to you that the better course would be to go to the Leader of the Opposition and say, 'There are national interest questions here. There is something beyond politics that matters here. The Australian community is looking to this place and saying, 'Find common ground; sort it out; move on; get this issue resolved for the nation.'' The Australian people are looking at this place and saying they do not, in this important area, want to see politics as usual, which is why we have been driven by the national interest every step of the way.                 We have facilitated the Leader of the Opposition and his team getting full access to information when they sought it - full access to a briefing from departmental officials and full access to a briefing from legal experts and representatives like the Solicitor-General. The Leader of the Opposition may not be being frank with the members of his backbench about what happened in those briefings, but the Leader of the Opposition was told that the Malaysia arrangement has the best deterrent value, that that is the best policy option available now, that that is the policy option that should be pursued, and that the appropriate thing is to amend the legislation to enable this government - indeed any executive government - to put in place the policies that it believes in. The Leader of the Opposition probably has not told you about that paragraph of the Solicitor-General's advice which talks about his doubts and the need to legislate for Nauru. This furphy being used by the opposition today that Nauru could be reopened tomorrow stands in the face of the Solicitor-General's advice, stands in the face of the legal advice the government has, stands in the face of the practicalities of opening a centre in Nauru, stands in the face of the costs and stands in the face of the expert advice that it will not work. I reiterate that I do not ask members opposite to endorse the Malaysia arrangement.                     What we have always asked of members opposite is that they get up in the morning and spend five minutes thinking about the national interest, that they suspend for just five minutes their constant obsession with their own political interest. We ask that in those five minutes they ask themselves, 'Is it appropriate for executive government to have the powers that it needs, the same powers that the Howard government used, to have people processed offshore - yes or no?' The answer to that question is yes, and that means the member who has asked the question, and all of the members who sit alongside him, should come into this House and defy the recklessness and political opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition and vote for the government's amendments. Every vote will be recorded by every member.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. In terms of the history of some of these big waves - and he refers to some of the big waves that have involved refugees and asylum seekers from Vietnam - successive Australian governments have had to deal with these questions. There was a big wave in 1976 and there was a second big wave in 1989 that involved mainly Cambodian, Vietnamese and Chinese nationals. Since 1990 we have seen refugees and asylum seekers on the move around the world and in our region from the Middle East, and since 2008 we have mainly seen people from the Middle East and South-East Asia.                 The member has specifically asked me about the question of Vietnamese asylum seekers. Overwhelmingly, they were brought to Australia from offshore under the Comprehensive Plan of Action. That is, it was a regional solution that our region worked on to create a circumstance where people would be able to have their claims processed offshore from Australia but developed nations, including Australia, would step forward and take a fair share of the caseload of those refugees. We have done so, and many of us would represent electorates in this place that are home to either refugees from those original waves or their sons and daughters, and they have made a remarkable contribution to this country. We get the opportunity on various days of celebration for the Vietnamese community to make that point directly to them and their community leaders.                 I believe this causes us to consider that the appropriate way of dealing with refugee and asylum seeker questions is to work in the region, and that is what this government has done - we have worked in the region. We went to Bali when the countries of our region came together and we negotiated a new regional framework. That was very important. That new regional framework spoke of transfer agreements, and under the auspices of that new regional framework we have negotiated the arrangement with Malaysia which we have the clearest possible advice has the maximum deterrence effect.                 I understand the member who asked me the question is of a different view on a number of these issues. That is, of course, his right in this place of democracy where people will come and put different views. But I believe every member of this parliament, including the member who asked me the question, needs to consider the national interest as the government presents amendments to this parliament to enable this government to process asylum seekers offshore and to transfer asylum seekers offshore. That obligation is on all of us. It is certainly on the Leader of the Opposition, which is why when he turned his back on the national interest yesterday he was doing the wrong thing by the people of Australia. He ought to reconsider the nation's interest.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his very important question, because jobs have been the No. 1 priority of this government from day one. That is why we moved so swiftly at the end of 2008 and in early 2009 to support jobs and to support small business. Because of our swift action we saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. That is something that everybody on this side of the House is very proud of. We also made sure that we kept the doors open to tens of thousands of small businesses during that critical time. What that has meant for our country is an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent, nearly half that being experienced in the United States and right across Europe. What it has also meant is that we have created in this country three-quarters of a million jobs in the past four years. Compare that to the fact that something like 30 million jobs have been lost elsewhere in the global economy.                     Through our actions we kept tens of thousands of people in work and we kept tens of thousands of small businesses operating. What that meant was that people went home with the security and the knowledge that when they finished work they would have job security into the future. Nothing is more important to the peace of mind of all Australians than the knowledge that they have a job and job security. What all these actions meant was that this country, almost alone among developed economies, did not experience a recession. That is a great benefit now as we set about maximising all of the opportunities which will flow from the Asian century. That is why we do understand the importance of investing in skills and education. Our $3 billion skills and training package was at the core of the budget. It is why we understand that we need to invest in infrastructure, particularly the NBN. It is why we understand the need to give a tax cut to small business, particularly those not in the fast lane of the mining boom. The $6,500 instant asset write-off is very important to the cash flow for small business and to supporting employment in that sector.                 We on this side of the House believe in investing in people and in building them up, making sure they have a job and a degree of job security, and making sure they have fair pay and working conditions. But, as we saw at the Press Club today, we know what those opposite think. They want to rip away wages and working conditions from Australians. We on this side of the House believe in supporting jobs. Those on that side of the House voted against the critical stimulus packages in this House, particularly in 2009.                 The Treasurer knows that I do not wish to see the responses being overly a form of debate. Incidental mention of other things, I am happy with. I was happy with the first instance but, if he returns to it, I have a degree of unhappiness. He will respond in a directly relevant manner to the question. The member for Sturt will leave the chamber for one hour under standing order 94(a).                   The member for Sturt then left the chamber                    -                      I was making the point that our recession-busting stimulus meant that Australia did not experience the capital destruction or the skill destruction that has been so damaging to so many other developed economies around the world. Opposition to that stimulus has got to be one of the most wrongheaded and incorrect economic responses that has ever been seen in this country. There was opposition to this stimulus. It was wrong, and it was the wrong economic call at the time.                 But because this side of the House got that call right we are in the position to experience and to maximise the opportunities that will flow from growth in our region. The rock upon which we build this policy is, of course, strict fiscal policy. That is why we need a parliamentary budget office - so that people right around the country can examine the costings of various political parties in our House. That is why we are so strongly supportive of the Parliamentary Budget Office. But those opposite oppose it, because they are not serious or competent in economic policy.

  In answer to the member's question, given the member has served as a minister for immigration in an earlier government, he would be well aware that government turns to the Solicitor-General for legal advice. We have received legal advice, we have released it publicly, and the opposition has been briefed on it. I could take the member to many parts of the legal advice but perhaps it will suffice to take him to paragraph 3, where the Solicitor-General - and the Solicitor-General has been working with other legal advisers so obviously it is the considered opinion - says:                 Our short advice is as follows. In the light of -                  and then he refers to the High Court case -                    Plaintiff M70 we do not have reasonable confidence on the material with which we have been briefed that the power conferred by s 198A could currently be exercised to take asylum seekers from Australia to either Nauru or to PNG for determination of their refugee status.                 They are the words of the Solicitor-General.                     The member asked me a question which included a form of words about why we don't immediately start processing in Nauru. That was the question I was asked. So I am directing the member's attention and the House's attention to the advice of the Solicitor-General. When I said at the start of this answer that the member who asked me the question, having served as a government member -                      knows that government relies on the advice of the Solicitor-General, he nodded. That would have been his experience as a minister. It is our experience and my experience as Prime Minister, and the advice of the Solicitor-General is as I have outlined it.                 That is before we get very complex set of questions involving unaccompanied minors. The minister, having served as a minister for immigration, is well aware of the very complex set of legal and policy questions involving unaccompanied minors, and the High Court has had something to say about the law involving unaccompanied minors as well. And so, relying on the Solicitor-General's advice, the factual circumstance that the government finds itself in, and that all members of this parliament find themselves in, is that the legal advice available to us is that one could not commence processing offshore without incurring legal risk. The Solicitor-General has particularly pointed to legal risks also involving complex questions around unaccompanied minors. That is the legal issue.                 The government is seeking to resolve that legal issue in the national interest so this government and future governments have the kind of power in relation to offshore processing that the member had at his disposal when he was minister for immigration when he did have asylum seekers processed in a non-refugee convention country. I say to the member who has asked the question that maybe he might want to consider and advise his counterparts in the opposition how inappropriate it is for them to try to manoeuvre this parliament into the end of offshore processing by basing their argument on the refugee convention when in government their actions were not associated with refugee convention countries. There is a word for that, and it is called hypocrisy.

  I thank the member for Corangamite. The government's Clean Energy Future legislation which is before the House will deliver very significant benefits for our economy, including increased investment and jobs growth under a carbon price. Treasury modelling predicts that the carbon price will drive around $100 billion of investment in renewable energy over the period to 2050 - $100 billion worth of investment in the renewable energy sector over the period to 2050. That will transform our energy sector and create a very considerable number of jobs, and those jobs will not only be in new industries but will also support jobs in traditional industries, where we will have growth in areas such as construction, electrical services and metal manufacturing. Put simply, the Clean Energy Future plan is good for economic growth in this country, good for productivity, good for investment and good for jobs. It is critical therefore that this parliament passes the legislation and provides certainty to businesses so that they can get on with the job of making the investments that are necessary in clean energy in particular.                 It is clear from reports that are contained in the Financial Review today that the uncertainty being generated by the rancour that is coming from the other side of this parliament by its opposition to the clean energy legislation, is directly hurting the economy and directly impacting upon the costs of investments. Tony Stocken of BP Solar had this to say in the Fin. Review today:                 Stable policy and certainty is crucial to all long-term infrastructure investments.                 Nick Sankey from the Commonwealth Bank makes clear that there is a risk premium in fact being applied to investments in renewable energy due to the uncertainty that is being caused by those opposite. He had this to say:                 There's very much a higher premium now before legislation has been passed. But then once legislation goes through, I think in most people's minds that premium will reduce. That means the legislation needs to go through.                 Professor Paul Simshauser had this to say:                 Project financing in Australia has become a bit more problematic. We're a bit of an anomaly globally. The only thing we could put it down to was we were having one of the most ferocious debates in the world on a price of carbon.                 That issue has also been reinforced in the reports by Martijn Wilder of Baker and McKenzie, who said, 'Until the opposition makes it clear what its actual policy is, there will be uncertainty.' And it goes on and on. That rank political opportunism from the Leader of the Opposition on this important economic policy and environmental reform is costing this country investment, it is costing investors in the price of the finance that they are raising and it is costing us jobs.                 The Leader of the Opposition talks the economy down, undermines consumer sentiment, creates uncertainty for investment, terrifies pensioners -                      with claims of ridiculous cost increases and then says he is going to take away their -

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question, confirming as it does that the opposition could not sustain their argument for their refugee and asylum seeker policy for half of question time.                     Of course, they cannot sustain it because it is founded on hypocrisy about the refugee convention and founded on the hypocrisy about assurances, so that has fallen away.                     In answer to the deputy leader's question about Fair Work Australia, the deputy leader should look at the Fair Work Act. What she will see there is that Fair Work Australia is properly set up as an independent body. It regulates itself. It does not act at prime ministerial direction on these questions. That would be quite wrong.

  Along with the member for Moreton, I joined the Labor Party because we believe in job creation and the Labor government, when it comes to office, delivers on that promise - and no more so than the government that has been in since 2007.                 The truth is that the record to date on job creation is remarkable - 750,000 jobs have been created in the four years that we have been in office. Not only is that a record in terms of job creation over that period of time; it has also been done against the background of a participation rate higher than anything achieved by the Howard government in its 12 years.                 This job creation, along with the fact that we are the only developed economy in the world to have avoided the global recession, makes the Australian economy the envy of the rest of the world. We have been looking at unemployment rates with fours in front of them while the rest of the world is contemplating figures at least double and sometimes quadruple that.                 I am also asked what the prospects are for the continuation of these programs. The prospects are even more remarkable because, as has been indicated by the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Treasury has estimated that in the next nine years 1.6 million more jobs can be created. That is the 750,000 that we have already created, which is the highest on record, being doubled twice over in the next nine years. But only if the policies that we are pursuing are implemented.                 We recognise that this is an economy in transition. That has been recognised and that is what the budget that the Treasurer brought down underpins. But we also recognise the patchwork nature of the economy and the need to engage the regions as well as the need to invest in the drivers of economic growth. Those drivers of economic growth, first and foremost, are what we are doing on the skills and training front - an agenda driven by the Prime Minister when she was minister for education and training. That was an investment that has seen the biggest ever expenditure in our schools, universities and TAFE colleges and an agenda committed to lifting the participation rates at secondary schools, in diplomas and in tertiary education. That is an agenda that has already been delivered upon, because we have lifted the retention rates in all of those spheres. Why is this important?                     It is said that this doesn't lead to jobs. If you do not lift skills and productivity I do not know where the jobs are coming from, brother. I am telling you this: so far as the education and skills agenda is concerned, KPMG has estimated that what we are undertaking in the skills agenda will, over the period from now until 2024, add an additional 4.1 per cent to our gross domestic product. That is an additional $100 billion per year to the economy, and you ask, 'Where are the jobs in that?' What do you think people do when they have that sort of investment except employ people? But it is not only in terms of that; it is because of infrastructure as well as the fact that we are cutting company tax.                 What are the risks to this? That is all being done because we are committed to dignity and prosperity. This will be stripped away with the return to Work Choices. Listen to Peter Reith at the Press Club. There he was, the former minister, advocating the return to a failed policy. Say no to that but yes to our policy.

  I see that the embarrassment about the refugee and asylum position of the opposition continues. They have given up defending it because it is indefensible and in breach of the national interest.                  In relation to the question from the Leader of the National Party - who is now trying desperately to cover up that the opposition is in a position that trashes the national interest and knows it cannot defend it - what I say is this: we in this parliament are dealing with the clean energy legislation. We are debating it; we will be voting on it. And when we vote on it we will be voting on whether or not members of parliament want a clean energy future. I believe climate change is real. I know that, from time to time, the Leader of the Opposition denies that, in the way that he denies other demonstrable facts.                 I believe that climate change is real. I have accepted the advice of the economists that the cheapest way of us cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. I know the Leader of the Opposition denies that fact, too, and wants to slug families $1,300 a year to pay for his plan, which will fail.                 There is a theme here: high price leading to failure - that is the Leader of the Opposition's approach. In this parliament we will act because it is in our national interest to act soon. There is a bipartisan target of cutting carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. It is therefore in the nation's interest to start moving towards that target as soon as possible and in the cheapest possible way. So we will put a price on carbon through the legislation before this parliament. We will create a clean energy future with all the jobs and investment that will come with it. We will give people tax cuts and increases in family payments -                      In response to the question, I was saying to the member who asked it - the Leader of the National Party - we will provide tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. I can well understand that the opposition is now desperately worried that it will go to the next election saying to pensioners that the opposition will take money out of their hands, saying to taxpayers that they will take money out of their hands, and saying to families with kids that they will take money out of their hands.                      I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about that but there is a theme here. Acting in the national interest on the issues of seizing a clean energy future and border security, and acting in the national interest to amend the Migration Act: there is never a day that the Leader of the Opposition walks into this parliament worrying about the national interest. He proved that yesterday.

  I thank the member for Bass for that question. This government understands that a serious commitment to equipping young Australians with a job for the future means starting early and acting comprehensively across early childhood and school education, across vocational training and higher education. As a song from the seventies, I think, said: 'If you're going to do it, do it right,' and on this side of the House we are doing it right. For the first time we have a federal government -                      Mr Speaker, I am happy to stick to my day job but my opposition number keeps on getting chucked out and is not even here for the question.                     For the first time a federal government is investing in early childhood education, some $17 billion over the next four years, including nearly $1 billion over five years to the states and territories to make sure that we have universal access for early learning for all Australian children in the year prior to school. The government is investing big time in teachers: $550 million in the Teacher Quality National Partnership. This means that teachers get the professional development they need to be the best teacher they can be for all Australian children and there is the first ever set of national teachers standards. That is why we are investing in literacy and numeracy. These are the building blocks of education. This is what gets you on the road to a good job.                 We are investing $540 million dollars under the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership, supporting over 400,000 students including, I am pleased to see, some 28,000 Indigenous students right around Australia. Of course, we are giving Australian students access to a world-class curriculum no matter where they live. We are investing over $100 million in the development of this national curriculum and over $2.4 billion in the Digital Education Revolution. We are providing access to a computer for every student in years 9 to 12, something that has never been done before. It is a program that the opposition leader promised to cut. He wanted to take about $600 million out of it. Over there they want kids to learn with chalk; we want to give them the computers to compete and learn in the modern world. We are also investing in Trades Training Centres so that kids get on the vocational pathway early. We have awarded more than $1 billion for 288 projects benefiting over 900 schools.                 I am asked about the impacts of not investing in the skills of Australians. The fact is that the opposition wanted to cut over $1.1 billion from the Trades Training Centres in Schools Program. That would have meant that over one million students around Australia, who could get on that vocational pathway, would not have had the opportunity, so the hairdressers, the chefs, the carpenters, the electricians and the brickies would have been denied that opportunity. We also understand the importance of extending that into investing in skills. Again there are record levels of investment in skills: $10.9 billion in the last three years in investment compared with some $6.8 million from those opposite.                 Finally, there is the importance of investing in higher education. There is the virtuous circle that goes from early, preschool education right through to university. An additional 100,000 Australian students are attending university this year. We invest in jobs in education because we know that it will make a difference to the prospects of future Australians. All we get from Mr Abbott is no, no to skills, no to supporting teachers and no to training. About the only thing he can say yes to is a recognition that there is one thing that he is actually in favour of - of course it is Work Choices. We will get on with supporting the future of Australia.

  I thank the member for his question. I am not surprised that it is not on asylum seeker policy. I am asked about Victorian government modelling. In relation to that modelling I can say this to the parliament: there are a significant number of problems with that modelling exercise from the Victorian government. The estimates of the economic impacts are right out of the ball park, at least four times higher than other modelling shows. When you have a look at why that would be, there are a number of very compelling and easy to analyse reasons.                 Firstly, the modelling includes an inaccurate representation of the government's $9.2 billion Jobs and Competitiveness Program, not modelled in its full extent. For example, it ignores assistance for industries like paper products manufacturing and chemicals manufacturing, which are important in Victoria. I certainly know that; my home is in Altona. So, these things have not been taken into account. The modelling assumes much higher emissions growth than other modelling does, increasing the emissions reductions needed to hit our targets by almost 30 per cent. So it is not in accord with other modelling because it overestimates the emissions growth.                 Then, of course, the modelling, which was done by Deloitte, includes results at the regional level which are too unreliable for organisations like the Commonwealth Treasury to use. The modelling also is flawed in that it attributes nearly all future electricity price increases to the carbon price, which clearly and directly overstates the impact of the carbon price. So that is another flaw in the modelling. Can I say to the member who asked the question, it has got one thing right, though, and I would direct the member's attention to this: the modelling discusses the need for linking to other credible international schemes, says that in our national interest and will ensure our emissions reduction targets are achieved at the lowest cost. That is right. That is absolutely right. It is part of the government's policies and plans and it is being ignored by the opposition, which is what inflates the cost of their policy to $1,300 per family.                 So generally to the member I would say: this modelling is flawed. We have released modelling from Treasury, we have released the figures which show the impact of the clean energy future, and coming from Victoria what I can certainly say to the member is: Victoria has many opportunities here because of the forefront technology of many Victorian manufacturers; many opportunities because of the investments in Victoria in the clean energy future and in the research and information technology bits of that clean energy future. What we will see with a price on carbon is jobs in Victoria growing. I know the member is concerned about that, I am concerned about that, and that is what will happen.

  I thank the member for Calwell very much for her question. She understands, as everyone on this side of the House understands, that after a lifetime of work older Australians look to the government to make sure that they can get security in their retirement. The government has already delivered historic reforms to the pension. I am very pleased to be able to say to everybody in the chamber today that from today Australian pensioners will be receiving the latest increase to their pensions as a result of our reforms. It is also the case, of course, that we are making sure that the value of people's pensions is protected into the future by the reforms that we have made to indexation. That, too, is reflected in the increases that are flowing to pensioners from today.                 The other area that the Assistant Treasurer is responsible for that is very important to older Australians is, of course, the increases and improvements to superannuation that this government intends to make. We believe in superannuation on this side of the parliament, unlike those opposite.                  We also know that it is increasingly the case that older Australians do want to do some work, sometimes some part-time work, in their retirement. Sometimes it is because they want to pass on their experience; sometimes it is to add a little bit of cash to their pension; sometimes it is just to keep in touch with the workplace. That, of course, is why this government has introduced a new seniors work bonus that is very positive for older Australians and particularly for those pensioners who want to do some part-time work. What eligible pensioners who are doing some part-time work will now be able to do is keep an extra $250 a fortnight without it being assessed as income under the pension income test. This is a very positive change for pensioners that this side of the parliament has put forward and made sure is there for our pensioners.                 We have also made sure that this new seniors work bonus is there to accumulate up to $6,500 over a year so that if pensioners want to do a block of work, say, at the end of the year - it might be marking exams, it might be being a Santa - that they can do that without it affecting their pension. These are all changes that this government has introduced to make sure that pensioners are better off.                 In addition, in this year's budget, we also made some changes for mature age workers. There is increased training available for mature age workers.                     Obviously people over there do not care at all about those unemployed mature age workers who do want a chance to get work. We know that those opposite do not care about mature age workers. We also know that all this Leader of the Opposition can ever do is say no. All he can ever do is say no. We care about the national interest; he only cares about his own interest.

  To the member's question, there are arrangements for self-funded retirees in the package. It does depend on people's individual circumstances - of course it does - but for anybody to gain the impression from his question that somehow if you are a self-funded retiree there is no assistance available is not right. In fact, some self-funded retirees will see the increase in the pension that full pensioners will receive; they will also experience a tax cut on income earned.                     Before the point of order, what I was about to say to the member for Kooyong is that I have outlined the general circumstances for self-funded retirees. For an individual, I would obviously have to get a lot of detail about their personal circumstances and financial affairs. I do not believe it is appropriate to do that in the parliament in this manner, but if the member wants to bring those circumstances to me then we will be happy to get him a very direct answer for his constituent.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. There are two unique characteristics about Australia's health workforce. First, it is growing and it will continue to grow for decades to come. Today, for example, the aged-care workforce numbers about 300,000 and this will grow to fully 900,000 over the next four decades, accounting then for one in 20 workers. The second point is that government in this area has a particular responsibility to ensure that that increase in demand is matched by an adequate supply. No government has ever recognised that responsibility like this government. This year alone we will spend more $1 billion on health workforce measures, compared, for example, to just $142 million in 2006-07.                  When we came to government we were confronted with very significant workforce shortages in health and some of those shortages were the result of truly bizarre thinking. We inherited a cap on the number of GPs trained each year at 600, a cap in place for the entirety of the Leader of the Opposition's time as Minister for Health and Ageing. Apparently, it was thought by some that constraining the number of Australian trained GPs would limit demand on Medicare, that Australians would be good enough not to get sick so much. Unsurprisingly, this particular approach to the laws of supply and demand in health did not work. Instead, communities across the country ran into doctor shortages and began to rely heavily on GPs brought in from overseas. This government smashed that cap. Under this government, the number of GPs trained increases every year and will reach 1,200 by 2014, delivering 5Â½ thousand more Australian trained GPs than would have been delivered under the old system.                 On coming to government, we confronted a nursing shortage; so we acted. This year, 42,000 nurses are in training, a 21 per cent increase on 2007. The extra graduate numbers have allowed Australia's hospitals system to employ 2,000 more nurses in the past year alone. On coming to government, we confronted a shortage of specialists; so we acted. In 2007, there were just 51 training places for new specialists across the whole of Australia. This year there are 518, a tenfold increase, including 96 in psychiatry alone.                  On coming to government, we confronted a broad shortage of health workers in rural and regional Australia; so again we acted. We directed 50 per cent of the additional GP training places and similar numbers of the specialist training places to rural and regional Australia. We overhauled the old incentives program that was based on population data from 18 years ago. Under our new program, 500 communities are eligible for incentives, providing incentive payments to 2,400 additional doctors and registrars for the first time. In its first year, doctor numbers have increased by 4.4 per cent in rural and regional Australia and by almost nine per cent in our most remote communities.                  When I talk to people in the health and the aged-care sectors about meeting current and future demand for a quality workforce I can be clear what they do not do: they do not pull out the latest back-to-the-future speech by Peter Reith and argue the case for - you guessed it - Work Choices. They talk instead -                    Mr Robb:                   Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Manager of Opposition Business was thrown out of this House about five questions ago for introducing debate into a point of order. Every minister since that question has introduced a serious amount of debate, and I ask you to rule this minister out of order.                     They instead talk to us about proper workforce planning, they talk to us about modern training, they talk to us about scopes of practice and they talk to us about competitive wages and working conditions for health workers. They know that that is what this government is focused on.

  I thank the member for his question. In part of the question he does raise a very serious issue. I understand that there are many manufacturing businesses in our nation today that are bearing the burden of a high Australian dollar. Indeed, so focused am I on that question that this morning I attended a manufacturing roundtable to talk about the pressures on manufacturing that are coming from the economic circumstances that we are in now, as we are in days of economic transformation. We know that in our economy that has a tremendous upside, which is the incredible growth we are seeing in the resources sector, with all of the opportunities that come with that - for jobs, for inward investment - this is a remarkable age for us in resources.                  But one of the consequences of that is that the Australian dollar is high, and it is predicted to remain high for a very long period of time. So the bus builder that the member is referring to in his electorate is someone who is bearing the pressure of that high Australian dollar. This is what we refer to in my parlance as the 'patchwork economy', and every step of the way we want to be engaged with manufacturing to make sure that it has a strong future. That is why we have done things like skills reform. That is what the minerals resource rent tax is all about.                     I was asked a question about redundancies today, in a manufacturing business where the person in the business discussed, among other factors, the high Australian dollar, so I am directly responding to the part of the question that raises that issue. What I am saying is that this is an issue for the business that the member raises. It is an issue for Australian manufacturing. Every step of the way we have been strongly engaged with Australian manufacturing. The minerals resource rent tax is about taking more tax from the strongest section of the economy, giving a tax cut to other businesses. The NBN has the ability to drive productivity in our manufacturing sector. We are working with supplier advocates so manufacturing can get its fair share of the growth from the resources boom by supplying the things that mining companies want. We are working through Australian industry participation plans. We have dealt with new arrangements in relation to antidumping. So every step of the way we have been strongly engaged with Australian manufacturing and we will continue to stay strongly engaged with Australian manufacturing. We want to make a difference. We want to be a country that continues to make things. We want to be a country that continues to manufacture things like buses.                 The member also raised with me the impact from putting a price on carbon. What the member may not be aware of is that we have specifically allocated literally over $1 billion to work with our manufacturing sector to support them in competitiveness, and we will be supporting them in competitiveness because we want to see a strong manufacturing sector and we want to see the jobs that come with manufacturing for the future.                  What I will not tolerate and what we will not do on this side of the House is things like the half a billion dollar cutback to assistance for the automotive industry - that is part of the opposition's plans - we will not do that, because we are very determined to support Australian manufacturing and the jobs of the workers within it.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his interest in this very important subject. You will know, Mr Speaker, that we have an objective of halving the life expectancy gap between Aboriginal people and the rest of Australians within a decade and also halving the gap in mortality rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under the age of five, which we are on target to do.                  In the most recent budget we announced expenditures of $1.2 billion dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, which is an 87 per cent increase over what the expenditure was when we came to government in 2007. An important component of what we are doing here is addressing chronic disease in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Two-thirds of the gap in health outcomes can be attributed to preventable chronic diseases such as tobacco smoking. We have delivered real benefits in addressing these issues through a chronic disease package of $805.5 million, which is part of a $1.6 billion COAG package to deal with the broader questions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. As part of the $805.5 million that we are expending, $100 million is aimed at tobacco.                 I make this very important point: tobacco consumption is causing a great deal of misery amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Twenty per cent of all deaths in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities can be attributed to tobacco consumption - 12 per cent of the burden of disease. It is very important that we address these issues. So, as part of what we are doing in this chronic disease package, we are investing in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workforce. It is a very important thing to do. We believe that if we want to improve health outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, not only do we have to make the money available but also we have to increase participation rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in addressing their own health needs. To that end, we are employing: 107 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander outreach workers, 51 chronic disease project officers, 17 practice managers, 11 health professionals, 31 regional tobacco action coordinators and action workers, 30 healthy lifestyle workers and 15 care coordinators. It might surprise you to know that we have had some criticism for this expenditure. Unfortunately, on 11 August, the shadow Treasurer, when referring to Aboriginal anti-smoking programs, said of this $100 million expenditure that it was 'an outrageous waste of money'. Then he said, 'The government is more interested in employing bureaucrats than it is in getting value for taxpayers' money.' That was responded to by an Aboriginal lifestyle worker - a person employed to do this job for us - Ian Lacey, a former Brisbane Broncos star. He said on ABC PM:                 We're actually out on the ground, we're doing programs, we're doing community sports days, community days, all about our people living healthier lifestyles and living longer. I'd love -                  Joe Hockey -                  to come up here _ I think he'd change his words pretty quick.                 I conclude by saying that we are dedicated to improving health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. We have a plan for jobs in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, unlike the opposition. All they have is Work Choices.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say that the position that the government is bringing to the parliament is known to him because he has been briefed on it. It is a position that serves the national interest. It serves the national interest because it does not rule out the policies or plan of either side of parliament. It would enable the Leader of the Opposition, if he were ever Prime Minister of this country, to enact the policy he believes to be the best. On the basis we are not bringing legislation to the parliament that would rule out the Leader of the Opposition's plan, we say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is not appropriate for him to try and change that legislation to rule out the government's plan.                 What is required here - and what Australians are looking for - is a moment of resolve from this parliament: a moment where we set aside politics as usual and work for the common ground. And the common ground must be legislation that enables either side of the parliament to have sufficient power to enact the solution that they believe to be best. Consistently I have said in this parliament that I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to endorse the government's plan for Malaysia. I do not ask that. With the appropriate power and with the implementation of the arrangement I would expect that the Leader of the Opposition in public discourse would continue to maintain criticism of it. That would be his right as the Leader of the Opposition and a participant in our democracy. What I do not expect is for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this place and deny to this government the kinds of powers that governments past have had and used and the kinds of powers that governments in the future may well seek to use.                  So, to the Leader of the Opposition I say that what we will support is the legislation that the government will bring to the parliament. It is appropriately constructed to be common ground. It would enable me, as Prime Minister, to implement the plan that the government has announced - the arrangement with Malaysia. It would enable the Leader of the Opposition, if he were ever Prime Minister, to implement the policy he believes is best - that is, Nauru. That is why it is common ground. That is why it is appropriate. Of course, every step of the way this side of the House will honour obligations under the refugee convention. I understand that to be common ground as well.

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her very important question. Overnight we have seen the release of the IMF World economic outlook. This talks about the growing instability elsewhere in the global economy and talks about the challenges that are posed for global economic growth. What the IMF has done is give a stark warning that the global economy has entered a dangerous new phase. This does reflect concerns about sovereign debt levels in Europe and it also reflects concerns about weaker economic activity in the United States. What the IMF has done with its forecast is that it has revised down its global forecast to four per cent in 2011 and four per cent in 2012, down from 4.3 per cent in 2011 and 4.5 per cent in 2012.                 It was always going to be difficult post the global financial crisis and the global recession. Things were never going to be easy. Of course, we are still living with the legacy of those events some years ago. Many advanced economies have not returned their output to what it was prior to the global financial crisis, and that is particularly the case in terms of the United States. You do not have growth momentum in either the United States or Europe, and what that is producing in those countries is very high levels of unemployment. Many of these countries are also struggling with the weight of excessive sovereign debt and hamstrung fiscal policies.                 What we need to see on a global scale is that these issues do need to be confronted, and they need to be confronted with the same determination that the G20 used during the global financial crisis and the global recession. In particular, we do need the major advanced economies to take swift and credible action to restore growth and confidence. This will certainly be the message that I will be taking to meetings in Washington of the G20, the IMF and the World Bank, because international engagement now is as important as it was a couple of years ago.                 Australia is not immune from these bouts of instability in the global economy, but we need to remember that our situation could not be more different than what we see in the United States and Europe. In the global economy we stand tall in a position of fundamental strength, because we did act to support jobs and growth at the height of the global financial crisis. What we did in this country successfully - and everyone on this side of the House is so proud of - is we avoided recession.                     Our economy has grown by more than five per cent since the global financial crisis - not something you could say in many other advanced economies. We do have something we are also proud of and that is an exceptional record when it comes to job creation - 750,000 jobs in the time that we have been in office. The consequence of that is low unemployment. We treasure that because in those countries which have high unemployment, this is what causes not only weak economic growth but the destruction of communities. We on this side of the House understand the importance of jobs and the dignity of work. The dignity of work is so important not just to individual families but to an economy. That is why we put such a high priority on jobs.                 On top of that we do have a very big investment pipeline - $430 billion. What we as a country must do is maximise the opportunities that flow from that investment pipeline by putting in place the essential reforms, the long-term reforms, that will maximise our prosperity: pricing carbon, investing in skills, making sure we get a proper return from our resources. If we do that we will continue to create jobs and prosperity for all Australians.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I say this: the resolve of the government is to amend the Migration Act and to implement the arrangement with Malaysia. The guiding principles for the government are: we want to support what will work, we want to uphold the refugee convention, which is why we have negotiated with Malaysia to uphold the most important sections of the refugee convention and those are the obligations not to return people to places of persecution and to ensure their claims are processed. We have gone beyond those obligations with identity papers, the ability to work and services in health and education. The criteria for the government have been: what will work? What will uphold the refugee convention? The arrangement with Malaysia will uphold the refugee convention. That is what is driving us.                 What is driving the opposition I cannot explain. Some days they come in here and criticise the government and say we are too soft on asylum seekers. Some days they come in here and criticise the government and say we are too hard on asylum seekers. Some days they say the refugee convention does not matter at all. The Leader of the Opposition is on the public record as saying that. The shadow minister for immigration is on the public record as saying that. Some days they say it is pivotal. When they are in government they process people in places that are not signatories to the refugee convention. When they are in opposition apparently it is the foundation stone for all of their beliefs.                     During that exchange the Leader of the Opposition has interjected at me, 'Consistent over a decade.' At some point the Leader of the Opposition is going to have to start dealing with the facts in the national interest. The facts are these: when the Howard government was in office - and the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in that government - it processed people in Nauru when it was not a signatory to the refugee convention. A fact that cannot be denied. Now apparently the Leader of the Opposition says you can only process people in countries that are a signatory - a complete backflip and inconsistency, part of trashing the national interest in support of their political interest.                  Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, you must have legally-binding arrangements. It would be quite wrong not to have legally-binding arrangements.' The Leader of the Opposition is known to use very ugly words about people in election commitments. His own policy document at the election talked about assurances, not about legally binding - another completely sharp act of hypocrisy for them to pursue their narrow political interest. Then the Leader of the Opposition says he could not possibly sleep at night if people were not processed in a signatory country. Meanwhile he says he wants to tow boats back to Indonesia with no guarantees of treatment at all - another huge inconsistency. Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition just get up and tell the truth? And the truth is he will do anything to prevent this government implementing the arrangement with Malaysia because he is afraid it will work, and he is dreaming of more boats coming to this country because he thinks it will serve his political interest.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. It is an incredibly important question for Australian families, one that we should be focused on in this parliament today, particularly following the International Monetary Fund report overnight. Our economy, as we meet today, is an economy that is the envy of the world. We are in this state because the Australian people worked together with the government to protect and save jobs during the global financial crisis. The government acted to provide economic stimulus, but the Australian people responded. Employers around the country, big and small, responded to keep people in jobs. Trade unions around the country responded to work with employers to do what was necessary, including short-time arrangements, to keep people in jobs. The government worked with employers and trade unions to keep young Australians in apprenticeships. This is why during all of this global economic turbulence we did not have a recession. We supported the jobs of 200,000 Australians and we kept young Australians in apprenticeships so our economy did not experience the destruction of skills, which comes with young people losing an opportunity for an apprenticeship or having their apprenticeship terminated before completion, and so all those young Australians could have the ticket that makes a difference for a better start in life. Today we should be celebrating the fact that the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister has been named as Euromoney's Finance Minister of the Year 2011 - something to be celebrated. It is an award for the Deputy Prime Minister but really an award for our nation, for what we have achieved by working together. This is only the second time an Australian has won this prestigious award in its 29-year history. Of course, the other winner of this prestigious award was Paul Keating, another great Labor Treasurer. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister because he views this as an award for the nation and an award for the economy that we have built together.                 We will continue to build that economy together and to strengthen it for the future - a future with clean energy; a future with high skills; a future with new technology and infrastructure, like the National Broadband Network; a future with strengthened traditional infrastructure like ports, roads and rail; a future that contains a manufacturing industry still working with vibrancy; a future with a tourism sector and an international education sector which are still working despite the pressures of a strong Australian dollar; and, of course, a future and an economy with a resources sector that is powering ahead with hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the pipeline.                  What makes the Deputy Prime Minister's achievement so remarkable is that he has achieved it day after day after day against the relentless negativity of the opposition and a Leader of the Opposition who slept through the global financial crisis and slept through the important piece of legislation to support Australian jobs. We will always be acting to support Australian jobs and prosperity, no matter what negativity the Leader of the Opposition chooses to pursue.

  I thank 'Scoop' for his question. Yes, the government has developed its thinking on this issue over time and we have changed our position. We have said, in the light of advice, that we should work with countries in our region - like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand - to improve protection outcomes. But we will do so in a way where we negotiate with them commitments for them to abide by fundamental human rights principles, and this is particularly in relation to our arrangement with Malaysia. It is one thing for a political party to change its position, as the opposition has done. It was only last year when the Leader of the Opposition said that refugee signatory countries in relation to offshore processing was a furphy. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said 12 months ago. Apparently it is okay for the Leader of the Opposition to do that.                     I point out that it is one thing for a political party to change its position and develop its thinking; it is another thing for a political party to have two positions at the same time - for a political party to say, 'You can't send asylum seekers to a country that is not a refugee convention signatory,' at the same time as arguing with a straight face that they will turn the boats around and point them towards Indonesia, with no commitments negotiated, which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. The opposition seem to think they can run two positions at once and walk different sides of the street on this issue. They say we are too tough, and then we are too soft. They say that the refugee convention is not important, and then that it is fundamental. The opposition think they can run two positions at once. I think the Australian people see through the hypocrisy of the opposition.

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question because this morning the government released its update of Treasury modelling on the impacts of the carbon price on the economy. Of course, the update shows the impact of a carbon price starting at $23. It also includes elements for the first time of the Steel Transformation Plan and the Jobs and Competitiveness Program that were not included in the initial report.                 The opposition has had a lot to say about the modelling and what it all means. We have heard a lot of rubbish from the opposition about the modelling. They have been claiming that the modelling would be entirely different, and all the impacts would be entirely different, when we put the $23 figure into it. The truth is that the updated modelling does not make any substantial difference to the outcomes of the initial modelling - no substantial difference whatsoever. What it does show - and this is very important - is that the economy continues to grow strongly, and gross national income per person will grow at an average rate of 1.1 per cent to 2050. It also shows that jobs will grow strongly, with national employment expected to increase by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. Incomes will continue to grow strongly, rising by around $9,000 in today's terms, by 2020. Emissions, of course, by 2050, will fall to nearly half of what they would have been without carbon pricing.                 What we see here is a picture of strong employment growth and strong income growth. We see a very effective scheme in terms of reducing emissions. This demonstrates that putting a price on carbon in the way we have is the least costly and most effective way of making this very important change. To be a first-rate economy in the 21st century, you have to be substantially driven by clean and renewable energy. What the carbon price does is provide that incentive for investment, particularly in renewable energy.                 But none of this is really understood by those on the other side of the House. The other day we had this real clanger from the shadow Treasurer. He was asked a question about carbon pricing and he said, 'Sorry, one of the biggest, most significant ways to reduce emissions globally has been economic downturns.' That was his seminal contribution to carbon pricing; he wants to do it by having a recession.                     The really important thing about this modelling is that it shows we can have strong and sustainable economic growth while cutting carbon pollution. This stands in stark contrast to those on the other side of the House who want to tax households $1,300 a year.

  I thank the member for his question; I have answered it on a number of other occasions. The member may want to speak to the Leader of the Opposition about the briefing that the Leader of the Opposition received from the experts who advise government - the very same experts who advised the Howard government. He may want to ask the Leader of the Opposition to explain to him that, in the briefing the Leader of the Opposition received, the experts explained that they expect the deterrence effect of Malaysia to be so strong that we would not reach the 800. That was the expert advice provided to government and to the Leader of the Opposition.                     I know the facts do not suit the opposition in this debate, but let's deal with the facts. The former minister for immigration in the Howard government, Mr Ruddock, interjected before, and I respond to that interjection: I am talking about expert advice from the same people whose advice he relied on when he was minister. The advice that they are providing is very clear: they expect the deterrence effect of Malaysia to be so strong that we will not reach the 800.                  Can I say to the member who asked the question: when he consults with the Leader of the Opposition and gets the fact that he got that advice from the experts - the same experts who advised the Howard government - he may also ask the Leader of the Opposition what plan B is when Nauru is full, if that is what he believes is the right policy.                  At the end of the day, this debate about the Malaysia arrangement and Nauru is not the debate that will come before the parliament. If the member genuinely believes that Nauru is the best solution, the best policy for refugees and asylum seekers, then he should come into this parliament and vote for the government's legislation, because it would give a future government -                      In answer to the member's question about the 800 - I have provided that answer - can I say to the member: the thing he will be required to vote on is whether government should have the power to implement the offshore processing plan that it believes to be best. That is what the member will be voting on. I would say to the member that, if he believes that government in this country should have the ability to process asylum seekers in an offshore location, then he should vote for that. What he should certainly not do is put himself on a destructive path of wrecking the ability of this nation to have asylum seekers processed offshore. He should not do that. It is not in the national interest to do so.

When I have had the opportunity to travel with the member for Kennedy in his electorate, he and I have discussed suicide in his electorate, and one time he particularly wanted to convey to me an individual family's circumstances. So we did have the opportunity to discuss these issues in some depth.                 Understanding how passionate the member for Kennedy is, I believe I can say to him on behalf of all members in this House that that passion for addressing this national tragedy of suicide is shared. I doubt that there is anybody in this place who cannot recount a story of suicide touching their own lives or those of their family, their own friends or the constituents that they see in their electorate offices. This is a major national problem.                 Because it is a major national problem, at the last election we made a series of commitments about better investing in strategies that can assist, in what are dark and desperate days, in preventing people getting to the stage where they think the only alternative is to take their own lives. Fortunately, we are aware that there are policies, plans and programs that can make a difference, and it is a question of providing the resources and enabling them to be rolled out in more parts of the country. In the electorate that the member for Kennedy represents, we do have a suicide prevention officer working with the relevant division of Queensland Health, and there is a meeting of stakeholders this week to develop an agreed approach on this. So the federal government is clearly there; the meeting is being organised through the relevant department.                 We are also investing in extensions to the Access to Allied Psychological Services initiative, and that will help Australians, including approximately 18,000 Indigenous Australians. We are investing in the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, which provides services and support for people with severe mental illness, for their families and for their carers. We are investing, too, in family mental health support services. We are also investing in a single mental health online portal, because when people are in dark days they may go looking for help but not feel comfortable having a conversation with another person; however, they may look for help on the internet. We want to make sure that there is access for them to services and reliable information rather than the information they may find on the internet which would not assist them at all during those days of darkness and desperation.                 I do understand how seriously the member for Kennedy takes this. I will ask Minister Butler to visit Mount Isa in the following weeks to discuss this with the member for Kennedy and to discuss it with the relevant people in his community, who are also very keen to take localised initiatives to try to address what are by any standards very alarming statistics in the part of Australia that the member for Kennedy represents.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Of course the government is committed to working in the national interest and restoring to the executive the power to set Australia's border protection policies. Our policy is the Malaysia arrangement - the first of its kind in the region. It represents a new level of international cooperation to tackle an international problem and it is negotiated under the regional framework, with protections built in. It includes guaranteed protections committed to by the Malaysian government of non-refoulement, work rights, access to health care and schooling for those transferred. These protections have been worked through with the UNHCR and agreed to by two sovereign nations in good faith.                 I am asked by the member for Melbourne Ports about different ways the Australian government can work with countries in our region on protection. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, has a different view - he has criticised the arrangement as not being legally binding.                     Earlier this week, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister in this House how she could ensure that obligations would be honoured when they are not required to be legally binding. Apparently, that is a new fundamental principle for the opposition - that negotiations must be legally binding.                     I am asked about different ways of negotiating protections with countries in our region, and there are two different ways: you can negotiate arrangements and get agreements with countries or you cannot. Turning the boats around on the high seas and pointing them towards Indonesia with no protections negotiated is a different approach to the government's approach of negotiating in good faith with Malaysia.                 Last night we saw a new development in this matter, with the Leader of the Opposition realising on the 7.30Report that it was a problem not to have protections negotiated with Indonesia. He said:                 _ there is no evidence that the Indonesian Government did refoule people in the past. We have no reason to think they wouldn't be prepared to enter into the same kind of understandings again.                 'Understandings'? I will have to check with the Attorney-General; I am not sure if an understanding is legally binding. I would be surprised if an understanding with Indonesia was legally binding. Apparently it is okay to send boats to Indonesia with an understanding but it is not okay to send planes to Malaysia when you have a formal agreement with a sovereign country! The weathervane swings again. The Leader of the Opposition is going to negotiate understandings with Indonesia -                      when the Indonesian government has made it clear it does not support turning back the boats. Just last week we had General Santoso, the head of the border protection unit of Indonesia, saying it would affect Australia's relationship with Indonesia.                 And there has been another development. The Leader of the Opposition said on 7.30 last night -                      What is clear here is that the opposition will adopt any hypocritical excuse to avoid supporting the government -

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I actually visited the detention centre in Nauru and I have some direct experience with briefings on the logistical challenges of maintaining a detention centre in Nauru. I received them then, when I was shadow minister for immigration, and certainly we have received them in government. What the member might want to recognise is how far away it is and the fact that all resources need to be flown to Nauru -                      and the costs of sustaining Australian staff on Nauru. I direct him to the minister for immigration's costings.                 I say to the member: the thing he will be required to exercise his vote on in this parliament is where I believe the Australian people are looking for us to act in the national interest. I know as soon as I say 'national interest' the opposition objects. I am not surprised by that.                     The member will be required to vote on legislation which is in the national interest and is about enabling -                      In conclusion, I say to the member who asked the question and to all members of this parliament that the way in which they exercise their vote on the amendments to the Migration Act should be in the national interest.                     I know discussion of the national interest enlivens interjections from the opposition. Perhaps they should save their energy from interjection and think what the national interest is. It is in the national interest that governments make appropriate arrangements for offshore processing. To the member who asked the question: I acknowledge that he probably very seriously believes that there should be a policy about an offshore processing centre on Nauru, but he should vote for legislation to enable that and enable the government to implement its offshore processing plan. That is in the national interest. This cheap politics is not.

  I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his interest in defence matters and defence industry, particularly coming, as he does, from South Australia. One of the highest obligations that an Australian government can have is to protect and defend the national security interests of the Commonwealth. That goes hand in hand with the obligation on the part of an Australian government to protect and enhance the economic security interests of a nation's people.                 To protect national security interests, one has to proceed with great care in strategic terms and proceed with great care in making judgments about capability. The mechanism the Australian government uses in that respect is, of course, the 2009 white paper, which is now subject to a commitment to be reviewed every year - so we are expecting a white paper in the first quarter of 2014. The white paper has what is described as the in-built Defence Planning Guidance, which is used on an annual basis to review strategic matters and capability. In the interim, of course, we have a $26 billion per annum budget for defence and the very important one- and two-pass capability mechanisms, which are considered by the Minister for Defence, the minister for finance and the National Security Committee. So these things are always done in a careful, considered and deliberative manner.                 The member asked me what adverse implications there are if this approach is not taken. If you do not proceed in a careful, considered and deliberative manner you can send confused and confusing signals. You can send confused and confusing signals to the Australian people, you can send confused and confusing signals to the region and you can send confused and confusing signals to the local defence industry or the international defence industry.                     I notice that the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance are indicating that a $70 billion effort in terms of cuts will be made.                     I am, Mr Speaker. I am talking about approaching these matters in a considered and responsible way. It is entirely appropriate, if the opposition want to, to say that they are proposing to effect $70 billion worth of cuts. They have also made it clear that no area will be excluded from that. So we obviously need to understand what they propose in terms of an orderly way for considering defence in this context.                 That is why I was very concerned yesterday when I saw on the front page of the Australian, out of the blue, 'Coalition to tear up defence blueprint - an exclusive interview with the shadow minister for defence'.                     Mr Speaker, I am going to that part of the question which talked about the adverse implications for defence capability if a considered approach is not taken. We have discordant messages from the shadow minister for defence and the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business on ABC radio this morning.                     We have seen the shadow minister for defence tearing up the white paper, we have heard the Leader of the Opposition saying they will not be and we have seen the Manager of Opposition Business saying that these were musings on ABC radio. You cannot muse about these matters. When you are dealing with national security issues, you have to deal with these matters in a considered and coherent way. You can take the path that the government takes - with the white paper and a considered, deliberative approach - or you can take an alternative approach.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. The matter of the Australian Public Service is extremely important to the member for Canberra, and I understand that. The Australian Public Service really does not get the recognition that it deserves. Every hour of every day somewhere around the world there is an Australian public servant working in the interests of our people and of our nation.                     Those opposite might think that is funny, but for those who are in trouble and who need the assistance of the Australian Public Service we all know that they are available. It often goes unnoticed that at the core of our Australian Public Service is a commitment to serve the Australian community, our families and our businesses. The Australian Public Service is world leading in its policy practice and methods.                 Those opposite and we in the government may not always see eye to eye on all things but at least we should agree that the advice from the Australian Public Service is unbiased, evidence based and objective. The role of the Australian Public Service is to provide policy advice and implementation of it irrespective of which political party is on this side of the House. That is at the core of the professionalism of the Australian Public Service.                 I am reminded, however, of the question that goes to the core of comments about the Australian Public Service. Yesterday, for 20 hours during the debate on the parliamentary budget officer bill we noticed a number of claims about the Australian Public Service from those opposite, those who questioned the impartiality and professionalism of the Australian Public Service simply because those opposite cannot do their own maths. In this place last night the member for Mackellar accused the Treasury of being politicised, that the opposition did not submit its costs to Treasury because it cannot trust Treasury. The member further accused Treasury of finding the $11 billion black hole because of its bias. I must assume that the member was referring to Treasury's well-known bias for facts.                 Last night the member for Cowan said:                 When we look back at what happened at the time of the 2010 election we see the way in which Treasury was used and directed to find every possible way to undermine and cast doubt on the figures of the opposition.                 This was not an admission that the figures of the opposition were inaccurate and did not add up but an assumption that Treasury officers would behave in a biased and unprincipled way. The member for Goldstein accused secretaries of departments of aiming to 'mislead Independents in the House' in order to get them to support the current government.                     As I was saying, the Australian Public Service performs a vital function for all Australians in the work that they do to support not only the creation of good public policy but also the delivery of outstanding public administration. To have members of this place critical of the professionalism of our public sector is frankly akin to throwing truth and fact overboard - something that those opposite do from time to time with gay abandon.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question.                     The government is determined to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We have put in place the fastest fiscal consolidation ever seen in the history of this country. This has been supported very strongly by reputable international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It has been observed upon by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. We do understand the importance of a clear, consistent and credible fiscal policy; and, when you look around the world and look at the sovereign debt problems we are seeing in Europe and other parts of the global economy, nothing could be more important than a clear, consistent fiscal policy. The government is determined to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13.                 I have been making a commonsense observation: because we are seeing a slowing in the global economy, it will have an impact on growth in this country and it will have an impact on our budget. I have made the commonsense observation that that makes our task more difficult. That is a commonsense observation. I know those opposite do not understand the importance of all this - they have a $70 billion crater in their budget estimates, and this comes on top of an $11 billion black hole in their estimates for the last election.                 So being lectured by those incompetents on fiscal policy is beyond the pale.                     Those opposite are simply disappointed that Australia has done well -                      that we have such a strong fiscal position. And we have such a strong fiscal position because this government put in place, when we moved to put stimulus in place, an exit strategy.                     We put it in place before any other advanced economies in the world and well before the G20 adopted its guidelines for advanced economies. But those opposite would rather see our country fail than this government succeed. They go around the place talking the economy down. Our economy has a great number of strengths, and one of them is a very strong fiscal policy, very strict fiscal rules, strong employment growth, very low public debt, very high investment - all of these things are good for Australia, and we should have confidence and celebrate those strengths for Australia.

  I thank the member for Dunedoo for his question. The Hawke-Keating governments set about systematically to fashion an open, competitive economy to turn the Australian economy away from an inward-looking economy protected by high tariff barriers -                      Dr EMERSON:                     and the sledging has already started from the member for Indi, of course, because she is absolutely and totally opposed to trade.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The result of the creation of the open, competitive economy through trade policy and broader economic policy has been that it has laid the foundations for two decades of recession-free economic growth, setting Australia apart from the rest of the developed world with such strong recession-free economic growth. These economic trade policies literally were designed to put Australia in the right place at the right time in the Asian region in the Asian century, a consequence of visionary leadership by Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and - I will give some credit - the coalition under John Howard.                 I have, however, been asked about the impact on jobs and prosperity of policies that damage Australia's competitiveness and export performance. Of course, this parliament has had to confront a private members' bill that would have banned imports of apples from New Zealand, an antitrade policy that would have risked retaliation for our Australian farmers. We have had to contemplate a piece of legislation - a private members' bill on palm oil labelling - that similarly would have violated our international obligations. We have had to contemplate a policy that would prohibit international trading in carbon permits. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition is not against international trade - just so long as it does not involve foreigners.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Thank you. Talking about policies that are needed to maintain our competitiveness, of course, sound fiscal policy is needed, and I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer of Australia for his award - for the accolade and the recognition that he so richly deserves.                 But of course a large budget black hole totalling in round figures $70 billion would undermine Australia's competitiveness. To be fair, is there a $70 billion black hole in contemplation? I think that is a worthy question to ask. Well, not if you believe the Leader of the Opposition, who says it is absolutely fanciful and there is no $70 billion black hole in contemplation. But there is another view, and it says, no, it is not a furphy; we came out with that figure.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Was that, as they are suggesting, the Labor Party? No; that was the shadow finance minister who admitted there was a $70 billion black hole.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The last word goes to Professor John Hewson, who says this man is totally innumerate.

  Facts are very inconvenient for those opposite. The assertion that somehow there is not carbon pricing occurring elsewhere in the global economy, that we do not have emissions trading schemes in Europe, that we do not have the development of those schemes in China or the development of those schemes in the United States is just simply wrong and it is deliberately misleading to make that point. But I do want to make a couple of points about why we need to put fundamental reform in place for our economy.                  When we look at where our economy is today, when we look at the fact that we did avoid recession - almost alone, amongst advanced economies - we should take a bit of time to analyse why that was the case. Yes, it was the very prompt response of the Australian people and the Australian government to deal with circumstances in the past four years but also what has been important, as the trade minister was saying before, has been fundamental long-term reforms, over the past 30 years, put in place by both sides of politics. There is no doubt that the Hawke-Keating government did put in place a whole raft of long-term reforms, which have stood this government in very good stead and stood this country in very good stead - and that side of the House when they were in government. But many of these reforms were opposed tooth and nail by those sitting over there today. They opposed the introduction of national -                      I was making the point that our economy is strong and that our economy is resilient, because past governments have put in place fundamental long-term reforms which have strengthened the resilience of the Australian economy. But many of those reforms, when they were introduced, were opposed tooth and nail. I was just citing one example of national superannuation. There were many others.                     I want to make the point that when those reforms were brought in, they were brought in in difficult economic circumstances. This government understands that if we are going to stay ahead of the curve what we have to do is continue to strengthen the resilience of our economy. And what we must do to strengthen the resilience of our economy in the 21st century is make sure that as an economy we have cleaner energy sources.                 You cannot grow strongly in the 21st century unless you have cleaner energy sources and you have investment in renewable energy. That is why carbon pricing - although it is a difficult reform and is being opposed by those opposite, tooth and nail - must be introduced. If we want to continue to reinforce the resilience in our economy we have to keep up to the mark with the long-term reforms. That is why the government is committed to carbon pricing. That is why the government is committed to the MRRT, a fundamental tax reform. What it does is recognise that we need a revenue stream to give a tax cut to business, to many of those businesses that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom. We are putting in place fundamental reforms to make sure that we strengthen the resilience of our economy for the long term.                  We are in our 20th year of continuous economic growth. If we want to continue that record going forward, we have to face up to the big questions, to the big reforms for the future. Do what is right for the future of the country. That is what we are doing on this side of the House when it comes to the economy, as we are doing right across the board, while those opposite are just putting their own selfish political interests ahead of the national interest, every time.

  I am asked this question by the member for Lyons, and I thank him for the question because he, like all of those on this side of the House, came into this parliament determined to defeat Work Choices. And we did that when we became a government and introduced Fair Work Australia. It was the Prime Minister today - the then Deputy Prime Minister - who led that charge and introduced Fair Work Australia. What that has done is to restore fairness to the workplace.                 It has restored fairness because it has restored the right to collective bargaining - a universally recognised right that was denied under Work Choices. It has also restored the requirement to bargain in good faith. That is also something that was denied under Work Choices.                  I am asked, also, what rights are affected when individual contracts were brought in. I remind the House of two pertinent examples. One was the Corowa meatworks, where they sacked all of their workforce and put a new workforce on individual contracts and did not pay any redundancy to the sacked workers. Then there was Spotlight, where the workers were taken off enterprise bargains, put onto individual contracts and had all of the penalty rates stripped away. They were two examples that happened under their watch that could never have happened under previous legalisation.                     I am asked, generally, how this has affected what individual contracts have done. When individual contracts were brought in in this country it had the effect of two-thirds of individual contracts cutting annual leave loading and penalty rates. One half of them cut shift work, overtime, rest breaks and holiday pay. One third of them cut public holidays and one fifth of them had provisions in them for no pay increase for up to five years. That is what individual contracts did.                 I also make the point that apart from restoring fairness and dignity to the workplace when we introduced Fair Work Australia, it has also had significant benefits for the Australian economy. We have had the record job growth which I spoke about yesterday. No four-year period in the history of this country has seen 750,000 jobs created. It has also been great for the economy because it has lowered industrial disputes.                  So why would anyone want to return to individual contracts? I am asked by the member: what is the future of individual contracts in this country? I say to you, under us there is absolutely no future, because we are determined to keep the system that we have in place.                 But the same cannot be said for the other side. We heard yesterday the former minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, stirring on the other side of politics to go back to Work Choices. But fortunately we had a statement from the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'We don't support individual contracts.'                     I am trying not to stray, Mr Speaker, but I am asked what the future of statutory individual contracts are. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition has ruled them out -                      No, Mr Speaker, that is not what the member for Mayo said. The member for Mayo, when he was asked today, said they wanted to return to them. There is no future for individual contracts under us. The only thing the other side cannot say no to -

                   To the Leader of the Opposition I say the following: first and foremost, the government will always be committed to a strong border protection policy. The Leader of the Opposition today is filibustering debate on protecting our borders, despite the shadow minister saying that they would facilitate a debate with the government, so that he can send to people smugglers a message which says, 'Come on down.' The Leader of the Opposition today has made it very clear he is putting his political interest before the nation's interest.                   The Leader of the Opposition is ignoring the nation's interest. The nation's interest today requires that we deal expeditiously with the migration amendments which are before the parliament and that the legislation is passed so that the government can implement its arrangement with Malaysia and so executive government can have the power it needs to make appropriate arrangements for offshore processing. Instead of that, the Leader of the Opposition in this place is filibustering that debate; the Leader of the Opposition in this place is determined to defeat offshore processing; the Leader of the Opposition in this place is determined to see more boats landing on Australia's shores. When it comes to this debate it is incredibly clear that the only thing that has ever motivated the Leader of the Opposition is his narrow political interest. Well, the leadership questions that this nation faces are not about narrow political interest or about base political interest by the Leader of the Opposition; they are about answering the policy questions of our age responsibly, and that requires the Leader of the Opposition to work expeditiously on the debate before the House on the migration amendments and then to pass the government's amendments, not to wish for more boats arriving.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. As the parliament meets today, Australians are paying attention to what happens in this parliament; and so are people smugglers. They are looking to see whether or not this House of Representatives today sends a message of resolve to protect Australia's borders or whether it sends a very different message.                 A little bit earlier this week the opposition appeared to understand that dealing with the amendments to the Migration Act was indeed a matter of some urgency, and they appeared to understand that it was the kind of matter on which the government and the opposition should work together. So, for example, we have seen the shadow minister for immigration, who represents the opposition on the question, saying in this place and beyond that they would be prepared to work with the government in order to deal with this legislation in an expedited way. Of course, that was the position of the opposition until it came to the moment to get it done; but now it is clear that the opposition will filibuster this bill, that they will drag it out and that they want to make sure that the message sent to people smugglers is that Australia is open for business. The opposition want to see more boats arriving on our nation's shores for the sake of their base political interests.                 I am asked what the national interest requires in this circumstance. The national interest requires that executive government have the power it needs to implement the offshore processing arrangements that it believes to be the best. Throughout this whole issue, the government have never sought to say to the opposition that they should endorse the government's plan. But what we have said to the opposition consistently is that they should pass amendments to the Migration Act which would put this government in the same position that the Howard government was in, with the freedom to act that that implies. Instead of that, the Leader of the Opposition has engaged, of course, in reckless negativity every step of the way. He has been asked to choose between the national interest and his personal political interest, and on every occasion - including today - in the handling of this debate his personal interest has come first.                 That is not leadership, and on an issue of this importance it is not what should be dominating the views of the opposition. What should be dominating the views of the opposition is ensuring that government can act to protect our borders and that our government can act to protect genuine refugees. The Leader of the Opposition at every stage has had the best of the expert advice to government, but despite that he continues to peddle a solution that he has been advised will not work. He continues to deny the expert advice that Malaysia is the strongest deterrence message we can send. Why is he doing that? It is not because he is confused; it is because he wants to send a green light to people smugglers because he wants more boats.

  I say to the Leader of the National Party that I agree with him: what matters is what will work. The Leader of the Opposition has sat with the same experts who advised the Howard government - and this cannot be denied, and the Leader of the Opposition has never denied it because he cannot deny it as it is an undeniable truth - and sought from them the best of their expert advice in the same way as this government does, and they have advised him that the Malaysia plan has the best deterrence value. So if, as the Leader of the National Party says -                      I was asked about what works, and I am indicating to the Leader of the National Party what is the expert advice we have and the opposition have. So I ask the Leader of the National Party, if he is genuinely interested in what works: why is the opposition repudiating that expert advice? Why aren't they listening in opposition to the same experts that they listened to when in government? Why indeed do they go out and trash that advice and deny its force publicly? They cannot deny they have received it, but certainly through these questions and the things they say publicly they seek to deny the force of that advice? Why do they do that? There is only one answer, and that is that, in this debate, they are actually not at all concerned about what works; it never enters their mind what works. In fact, they want to make sure that the most effective policy this country can have today is denied this government, and they want to do that because they are motivated by their base political instinct.                 The Leader of the National Party asked me about opinions in today's newspapers, and I thank him for that, because my eyes have gone to an opinion in today's newspapers, too. Former state Liberal leader Bill Hassell, in the West Australian says:                 What seems to be possible now is to 'stop the boats', to use the catchcry of Tony Abbott from the last Federal election.                 Now the objective is within grasp it seems Mr Abbott and the coalition may stymie it.                 That is, they spent all of the last election campaign saying that they stood -                      I was asked about effective policy and what works, and I am drawing the House's attention to a directly relevant statement in today's newspapers. That statement is from Bill Hassell, a former Liberal leader. He says:                 The Opposition is baulking. It suggests that the only solution is the one it favours, which is offshore processing in Nauru.                 It suggests, apparently in distinction from the Government's legal advice _ that the Nauru solution can be achieved within the parameters of the High Court decision on the Malaysian solution.                 The article goes on to say how false these views are and then says that the opposition 'should not seek to insist on an outcome which amounts to the implementation of coalition policy,' and:                 The national interest demands a solution to the constant flow of boat people.                 So I say to the Leader of the National Party that, if he is truly concerned about what works, he will direct members of the National Party to vote with the government and to vote in favour of the government's amendments to the Migration Act so that we can implement the policy that the experts who advise this government and the former government tell us has the maximum likelihood of working. That is what he should do in the national interest.

  I remain determined to implement our arrangement with Malaysia and, in that determination, I remain determined to give 4,000 genuine refugees, who are in Malaysia now and have been appropriately processed, a new life. Many of them have waited for years for a chance at a new life. But, yes, I do want to implement the Malaysia arrangement in its entirety - that is, I want to take the action we have been advised will be the most effective to deter people from getting on leaky boats, so that we do have the transfer arrangement with Malaysia and we do take 4,000 people and give them a new life.                 To the member for Bennelong who asked this question, I do ask him to reflect on this: what is wrong with the government having the power it needs to implement the plan it believes is the best to give 4,000 people a new life, properly provided for, costed and appropriated within the government's budget? What is wrong with that? Apparently the only thing that is wrong with that, from the point of view of the opposition, is that it does not serve their base political interest. So the opposition, if it continues on the course that it is on now, will deny this country the ability to process asylum seekers offshore. The opposition will have on its conscience the increase in the number of boats that set sail to this country. They will have this on their conscience having facilitated people smugglers by sending them a message that this country is open for business. The government remains determined to implement the Malaysian arrangement. If the member is concerned about people who are genuine refugees getting a new life, he should vote for the Migration Act amendments.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I think he knows, and every single member of this House knows, that many Australians do like to have a bet. But I do think every member of this House also knows that gambling can be highly destructive and addictive and does lead to many, many families having a very miserable existence. We do know in particular that poker machines can be a serious problem. In fact, it is the case that three-quarters of people who have a gambling problem have a problem with poker machines. I am sure the member for Denison, like me, has received representations from many, many people around Australia. I would just like to share with the House the words of one woman who wrote to me. She said:                 My life has been irreversibly damaged. At my worst it was not a rare event for me to sit there for 12 to 15 hours. I literally lost a fortune playing them.                 Problem gamblers, of course, as we know from the Productivity Commission report, spend on average $21,000 a year. Whether that is money lost on poker machines, we know that that is money that is not being spent on food, bills or paying the family mortgage. So we do know that poker machines are really leading to very serious problems for many, many individuals and families, where the lives of both the adults of the families and their children can be ruined. That is why this government is taking action. It is because families' lives are being ruined.                 That is why, back in 2008, this government asked the Productivity Commission to do the major inquiry that it has now presented on the whole issue of problem gambling. They brought down a number of recommendations about the best ways to help problem gamblers. At the time when we asked the Productivity Commission to do this inquiry, we had the support of the opposition, the industry and the community sector - many people recognising just how difficult this problem is and how important it was to do a proper investigation.                  The Productivity Commission themselves recommended that we should introduce a full system of precommitment technology as the most effective way to help problem gamblers. The idea behind this is that precommitment technology provides a tool to individuals to make sure we give them help as they sit down to play the pokies. Before they start playing, they themselves can decide how much it is that they want to spend on any one day or night. They can set their own limits and then they can stick to them with the help of precommitment technology. We are bringing in this system of full precommitment. We intend to deliver it in 2014 for the big gambling venues, and by 2018 for the smaller pubs and clubs with 15 machines or fewer. We have involved a lot of different organisations in the discussions on this. Most importantly, I am pleased to inform the House that all the states and territories now agree that precommitment technology should be available on every single poker machine in the country. I think that has been a very significant agreement. We have begun work on the Commonwealth legislation and we will proceed with that if we do not get agreement with the states and territories.

  I thank the Chief Government Whip for that very good question. Indeed, he would be aware that this government has had some 195 pieces of legislation passed - 195 passed, none defeated. The government is able to function effectively in a parliament that is functioning effectively in spite of some of the bizarre strategies we have seen to circumvent the parliament being able to determine the direction of legislation. This week alone we saw, firstly, more than 12 hours of debate on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill. It went until after midnight. It took until 10:30 for the opposition to realise that the filibustering was not going to get them anywhere because the legislation, based upon the unanimous agreement of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, was going to be passed by this House. We know that they had 70 billion reasons why they wanted to oppose that legislation but their filibustering did not work.                 Last night there was a procedural debate to facilitate five extra sitting hours on the clean energy bills - something that the opposition said they wanted. What was their response? Not to support it but to talk it out for 90 minutes.                     The member opposite says, 'We're supporting it.' But they talked it out and filibustered so that there would not be a vote on it, preventing not only the 20 additional speakers on Tuesday, 11 October, but also six additional speakers last night. But it gets more bizarre.                     Looking at the public comments that have been made, one area where I would have thought there was broad agreement from the majority of this parliament is offshore processing. There is legislation before the parliament right now in order to ensure that can occur. Yesterday when that legislation was introduced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the shadow minister for immigration stood at the dispatch box in this House and said -                      He said that they would be pleased to accommodate the debate on that legislation. What is more, it has been said that the opposition would be happy to accommodate it immediately. We then had a media offensive throughout yesterday, with them saying it should be brought on and determined. What we did was bring it on, and when we did those opposite claimed credit for us bringing it on. First they said they wanted to bring it on, then they said the government was responsible for it being brought on and then, when it was brought on, they tried to talk it out. That is what has been going on.                     They asked for the debate, claimed credit for it and then talked it out. That is not leadership; that is weakness.                     We will ensure that these issues can be determined. They cannot argue on the one hand that this is urgent, as they did all day yesterday, and then walk away from a determination of that legislation. It is vital that this parliament be able to determine that legislation. The government is determined to ensure that is the case. Those opposite are, by their own words, hoist with their own petard.                 Leave not granted.

  To the member's question I say not one fact asserted in it is true. The member who asked the question knows more than many others the obligation for accuracy in this debate. First and foremost, to the assertions in the member's question, it is not true, it is wholly untrue, and it is completely misleading to say to any Australian that Nauru could be immediately opened. It is wholly untrue, completely misleading, and anybody who says that is just trying to mislead and cover up their true intentions. Point No. 1: the High Court case, as we are advised by the Solicitor-General, creates huge legal risk in relation to Nauru. The member shakes his head but he cannot, by shaking his head, wish away the reality of what the Solicitor-General has advised. I say to the member: why is he, in this parliament, and why is the opposition, more generally, trying to mislead and misconstrue that advice because they are?                 Secondly, the opposition tries to mislead and misconstrue the expert advice from people who advised the member when he was minister. He every day relied on their advice. He valued their advice and those very same people, exactly the same people in whom the member when he was minister for immigration placed so much trust, are advising this government, and they have provided the same advice to the opposition, that Nauru will not work. Those advisers have told us Nauru will not work.                 I say to the member who asked the question: how is he, of all people, going to feel when he walks into this parliament and votes to destroy offshore processing? How is he, of all people, going to feel about that? How is he, of all people, who fought so hard to have executive government in the driver's seat, not the High Court, when it comes to refugee and asylum seeker policy, going to feel about voting to destroy offshore processing and voting to destroy the ability of executive government to determine policy in this area? The member who asked the question served as immigration minister for a very long time. It was a very controversial period in Australia's history.                 I say to the member who asked the question he should recognise that he, if the opposition stays on its current course, will come and vote to destroy offshore processing and to destroy the right of executive government to make decisions on refugee and asylum seeker questions. The member who asked the question, more than anybody else in the opposition, should be reflecting on how they will feel when that causes more boats to set sail. How will they feel when more desperate people get into leaky boats, risking their lives because of the way they have voted in this parliament? How will they feel when more people come in greater numbers because they have sent a green light to people smugglers? That is what is under debate in this parliament. No amount of spin, no amount of sloganising and no amount of trying to deny the facts covers that up. The opposition are proposing to vote to deny the right of executive government to have offshore processing for a base political reason. They want to see more boats - full stop. That is it; that is all that is motivating them.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. This government takes border protection very seriously. We know that border protection can be very dangerous work. For the men and women of Customs and Border Protection and for the men and women of the Australian Federal Police, this is not something that is just chatted about at workplaces at lunchtime. This is not just chatted about in pubs or in front of televisions. Indeed, it is not about a debate in parliament. For those men and women, border protection takes place on the high seas. Border protection takes place in villages in Indonesia and at cliff faces on Christmas Island. They know that without us stopping this insidious trade there will be more maritime disasters in this country. 19 October is the 10th anniversary of SIEVX, the tragic loss of 353 people, 65 men, 142 women and 146 children, who perished on that day 10 years ago - a terrible tragedy. In April 2009 five people tragically died in the explosion of SIEV36 and of course we know on 15 December last year approximately 50 men, women and children perished after their vessel foundered on the rocks at Christmas Island. Indeed, that would have been worse if it were not for the brave, selfless deeds of Customs and Border Protection personnel who literally plucked people from the water.                 I say to this parliament that those people, the AFP and the Customs and Border Protection personnel, know something about this issue and they deserve to be listened to. I want to say particularly to the Leader of the Opposition that the Australian Federal Police and Customs and Border Protection believe that the Malaysian plan is the most likely plan to deter people from getting on these unseaworthy vessels on perilous journeys. That is what they believe. You know what? They deserve to be listened to for what they know and what they do every day. That is what they deserve. Indeed, it is true to say that that has not been listened to by the opposition. What sort of political leader does not listen to police on criminal matters? What type of political leader does not take border protection advice from border protection agencies? Indeed, what type of political leader puts his own interests -                      ahead of those of men and women of Customs and Border Protection?                     I have been asked about potential maritime disasters and I am saying to this House that I believe it is incumbent upon the parliament in considering matters to consider the advice that we receive from Customs and Border Protection and the Australian Federal Police. That is what I am saying to this House. I say to the House that those agencies are of the view that the Malaysian plan is the most effective deterrent. My view is that, in his heart of hearts, the opposition leader knows that. In knowing that, it is one of the most unconscionable acts, one of the most reckless acts, to ignore that advice because the consequences may well be -                      not only people on leaky boats perishing but people on our boats, in our uniforms, who protect our borders.

  The position of the government was outlined in an opinion piece by me published in newspapers during the course of this week. She would have seen in that opinion piece that the text of the resolution is not yet available. The government will make its final decision, as was made clear in that opinion piece. Apparently, the opposition does not follow foreign affairs or read the newspapers on these questions. I refer them to the exact sentence in that opinion piece about the question of text. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to read it. The opinion piece represents the position of the government.

 I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know she is interested in reforms to strengthen Australia's economy for the long term. In fact, if you want to reform the economy for the long term you have to get the fundamentals correct - fundamentals such as keeping people in jobs and creating jobs, fundamentals such as encouraging foreign investment, new enterprise and sustainable industries and making sure that you have strong fiscal settings and a robust budget bottom line.                 It is because these fundamentals are strong today that we can do some of the long-term reforms that are required in our country for tomorrow, the next week, the next year and the next decade. Fundamental change such as putting a price on carbon pollution. Fundamental change such as a National Broadband Network to harness the potential of the digital economy. Fundamental change such as lifting compulsory retirement savings so that people in Australia do not have to work their whole lives and retire poor. Fundamental change such as improving our social welfare support and developing the foundations for a national disability insurance scheme.                 Members opposite should by now be well aware that we intend to ensure that some of the Guinness book of record profits being made by some of Australia's richest mining companies are shared throughout the whole of Australia - through decreasing the corporate rate of tax, through supporting small business and through lifting compulsory retirement savings. That is the fundamental change we are talking about. Yesterday we announced further reforms of a fundamental nature to improve the superannuation system to make sure that when people are having their money compulsorily saved the investment managers, the fund managers, and all those who get to handle those investment retirement savings, do not charge excessive fees and excessive rates for handling people's money.                 We are introducing new low-cost default superannuation funds called My Super. We will be consolidating accounts - the 30 million accounts which 11 million Australians have - and we will be improving the electronic back office of the administration of superannuation. We will be applying strong fiscal discipline and economic management to what we are doing. It is important that we have these fiscal frameworks. By establishing a new Parliamentary Budget Office, an independent costing service, we will have greater accountability and transparency in policy making.                 For the first time ever, members of the opposition, individual members of parliament and senators, will have an opportunity to have an independent and confidential costing service outside a general election period and also during election campaigns. One of the reasons this change is important is we never again want to experience the sort of 2010 election campaign when those opposite tried to sneak through an $11 billion black hole.                     Obviously I would not wish to debate that unfortunate bit of history. When we look forward we understand that, whilst this economy is going very strongly, the world economic environment is still a precarious place. That is why it is important we are able to return the budget to surplus. That is why this government is engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation that we have ever seen and why it is important that whoever wants to form the government is able to explain how they will fund their policies. That is why it is important that we do not have the $70 billion black hole that those opposite would inflict upon Australia.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and know her commitment to protecting workers' conditions in this country, like all of those who sit on this side of the House. I was asked, first of all, how we have worked to improve the working conditions of Australians. The most effective way we did that was to get rid of Work Choices. I was also asked how we intend to protect those conditions going forward and the answer to that is pretty simple too: by not returning to any aspect of Work Choices.                 This is a position that we hold firmly and are convinced about because we saw in the government that we replaced a continuous and progressive dismantling of workers' rights in this country. The first instance of that most graphically came in 1998 with the Patrick's dispute, a dispute that saw the mass sacking overnight of an entire workforce and the replacement with another workforce, a scab workforce, and legislation passed at midnight by the cabinet, or approval passed at midnight by the cabinet, that allowed it. We also saw, in 2000, the workers' entitlements stripped away in the case of National Textiles and then special legislation to protect only one employer in this country - the Prime Minister's brother. So there you had, in the previous government, legislation on the one hand to strip away workers' rights and on the other hand no action on legislation to protect workers' rights. That is what we replaced.                 2004 saw the culmination of this encroachment with the stripping away of workers' rights. It was called Work Choices. It removed unfair dismissal protection and it made it easier to move to individual contracts in this country. Those individual contracts collectively were responsible for stripping away even more workers' rights, because two-thirds of the individual contracts that were entered into in this country saw a reduction in annual leave loading and a reduction in penalty rates. Half of those that were introduced in this country saw a reduction in shift loadings, in overtime, in rest breaks and in holiday pay.                 So much for Work Choices - these were workers that had no choice. They were told, 'Take the job and the cut in conditions or no job at all.' That is not the way this country functions. We believe in the dignity of working people in this country - you give them dignity and they return benefits to the nation. Under us, we saw fairness restored - the requirement to bargain in good faith and the protection of workers' rights. As a result of that, we saw job security. And, in four years, the largest number of jobs ever was created because of the fairness and dignity that we reintroduced to the workplace by the Prime Minister when she was Deputy Prime Minister.                 The economy also benefited from all of that. Why would we move away from it? Who wants us to move away from it? There are members of this House who want us to move away from it. The member for Mayo said as much the other day, and the member for Higgins wants us to move away from it. And I could name a lot more of them. They are being spurred on by the cheerleader, the person who introduced the balaclavas, Peter Reith. He wants them to return to Work Choices. Say no to the return of Work Choices and you will only get -

  I can see why they got the member who asked the question to ask this one. Can I say to the member: the government will continue to do all things that are necessary so that when ministers travel there is prudence about the expenditure. I presume they asked the member who did ask this question to be the person who asked it in the parliament because none of the former Howard ministers wanted to ask the question, presumably because they used to be advised every day to spend up.

  I would like to thank the member for Braddon for his question. As the Treasurer indicated yesterday, the Treasury has released the updated macroeconomic modelling of the carbon price. The updated modelling clearly shows that the economy will grow with a carbon price while we at the same time cut our emissions. The Treasury modelling makes absolutely clear that gross national income is projected to grow at 1.1 per cent per year to 2050 and employment will also grow strongly - in fact, 1.6 million new jobs are projected by 2020, with or without a carbon price. The economy will continue to perform very well under a carbon price. The modelling is independent. It provides a sound economic analysis that allows government to make reasoned, economically responsible policy decisions and choices.                 That basis, and the basis upon which policy has been developed, contrasts very strongly with some of the quite ridiculous statements that have consistently misrepresented the economic impacts and the price effects of carbon pricing. The community has heard it said at various times: 'The hit on Australians' cost of living is almost unimaginable.' It has also been said:                 _Â the carbon tax ultimately spells death for the coal industryÂ _                 And the community has heard:                 Whyalla -                  a steelmaking town -                  will be wiped off the map _ Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town, an economic wasteland if this carbon tax goes ahead.                 Statements like that are of course designed to deceive people; they fly in the face of evidence and facts, and they create fear, uncertainty and insecurity in the community. What is important in formulating any economic and environmental reform of the nature of a carbon price is that the policy decisions and the communications to the community more broadly are underpinned by facts and robust analysis.                 The comments that I have quoted are attributed to the Leader of the Opposition. He is responsible for those statements, and they deserve to be tested against some of the facts. In relation to the price impacts, the Treasury modelling shows that the price impact is the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of the CPI, whereas of course the GST had an impact almost four times as great. And nine out of 10 household under the carbon price arrangements will receive assistance to meet those modest price impacts. In fact, an average of $10.10 per household per week will be received, compared to an average cost of $9.90 a week. This shows that the opposition's arguments are completely antithetical and this exposes the comments that the Leader of the Opposition has made as the rubbish that they are. But let's look at the coal industry and the facts in relation to that as well. The allegation made is that the industry will be destroyed; the fact is jobs will grow. Investment is growing - $70 billion of investment - 19 new mines are coming. The statement made by the Leader of the Opposition is completely fallacious. In relation to Whyalla: not only has OneSteel stated that its operations at Whyalla are continuing and that the government has responded to the issues it raised but in fact new investments are to be made. The statements we have heard have caused fear, insecurity and uncertainty; they are completely fallacious and totally unbecoming of anyone in political leadership.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question, because I know that she works very hard in that electorate for schools. She is making sure that we continue to deliver a really profound reform agenda in education not only in South Australia but right around the country.                 I doubt whether anyone would have imagined pre-2007 that a federal government would double the investment in education over the quadrennium. That is what this government has done. We are now spending double, in terms of investment, what the coalition spent on education - some $65 billion investment in schools, trade training centres, the transparency agenda and, most importantly, lifting up those kids in schools around Australia to make sure that they are well equipped to come out of school and into a further learning or working experience.                 We are driven by a central conviction that education in Australia is the great enabler and that every single Australian student is entitled to the best and fairest education that they can get. We have a number of directed investments specifically geared to that aim. It is not just Building the Education Revolution; people tend to think of it as bricks and mortar. It is true that we are improving the infrastructure in schools in ways never seen before but that also improve the teaching and learning conditions in the school. When teachers and kids walk into new assembly halls, new science labs, and new classrooms - with whiteboards up on the wall - they are learning well. They are being taught well. That is the kind of investment that really counts and it is also the kind of investment that is a legacy of the decisions that have been taken by this government and by the Prime Minister in her former role as Minister for Education.                 We are not just talking about university and academic pursuits - important as they are; we are also talking about recognising that, if we are going to meet the skills shortages of the future, we need to make sure that young Australians have an opportunity to get on the skills pathway whilst they are still at school. That is why we are investing $2.5 billion in trade training centres, giving kids the opportunity to get on that skills pathway with good learning at an early age. These investments are making a profound difference to education right around Australia and they are enabling young Australians to be confident learners and to be successful as they take on their careers post school.                 As well as that, we have investments in transparency, with the My School website, a national curriculum and national standards for the first time. It is like railroad tracks with different gauges in different states; our teachers should have the same national standards. Our kids should have the same national entitlement to the curriculum. These are serious, substantial education reforms that lie right at the heart of Labor's agenda and right at the heart of our national purpose.                 I want to make the point that all we hear from the opposition is negativism. They wanted to take $2.8 billion out of the education budget -                     These investments are making a profound difference to the opportunities that young Australians in every state have. Regardless of where they live, regardless of how much their parents earn, regardless of which school they go to, under this government every young Australian will get the best and fairest education they can, because we are providing that investment.

  May I remind the shadow Treasurer that there are bipartisan commitments in this country to cut carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. Either the shadow Treasurer is suggesting that the opposition no longer holds that commitment - and I do not hear him suggesting that - or he is suggesting that that remains the commitment of the opposition. If it remains the commitment of the opposition to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, then the questions that need to be answered are: when should we start to do that? And how should we do it?                 I say to the shadow Treasurer: if he is concerned about adjustments in our economy, then it would make sense, wouldn't it, to start soon and that there is not some form of dramatic dislocation in 2018 or 2019 because you have not started until then. You would start soon - that is what we are intending to do - and you would use the most efficient method possible. The shadow Treasurer would be studying his economics, I am sure, to fulfil his role as shadow Treasurer. If he were doing that, he would be well aware that reputable economists here and around the world recommend that the least cost way of cutting carbon pollution is by putting a price on carbon that big polluters pay. That is exactly what we are proposing to do. The shadow Treasurer, I believe, if he brings economic rigour and principles to bear, would have to look with disgust at the opposition's policy, knowing that it will be wasteful, knowing that it will be inefficient, knowing that it will be more costly, knowing that for every tonne of carbon abatement it will cost more and, ultimately, it will add up to a cost for Australian families of $1,300 per year.                   Mr Hockey:  Mr Speaker, on a point of order - it does go to direct relevance: I asked the Prime Minister why now is the time to have a carbon tax in Australia four times larger than Europe.                      On the question of timing of starting to address carbon pollution, I have been addressing that. I presume the shadow Treasurer must stand for starting in 2019 and trying to do it all in 12 months at some hideous cost per tonne of abatement rather than having our economy adjust over time, using the most efficient mechanism possible.                  I presume in his question the shadow Treasurer was referring to some advertisements and comparisons that were done by the Australian Trade and Industry Alliance about the Australian scheme and the European scheme. As the Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency made clear yesterday, those advertisements compare an overinflated number for Australian permits with only auction revenue from the introductory phase of the EU's emission trading scheme - or, put more simply, it is an apples to oranges comparison that does not stack up.

  I thank the member for his question. It is very important that Australia maintains its open, competitive economy. It is those  reforms that were initiated by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and carried forward in places by John Howard that have laid the foundations for 20 years of recession-free economic growth. It is true that there is a sense of rising protectionist sentiment around the world, and that itself is a threat to the completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those protectionist sentiments are not being expressed just overseas; they are being expressed here in Australia, both outside and inside the parliament. We have seen that expressed through a bill that would have prohibited the importation of apples from New Zealand. We have seen it expressed through a private member's bill that would have required the labelling of palm oil in a way that is inconsistent with Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations.                  We have seen proposals in relation to dumping measures, and I commend the customs minister for a very comprehensive and sensible WTO-consistent set of measures to deal with dumping, but there is in fact a dissenting or minority report from the Senate which basically says that we should be looking at a reversal of the onus of proof in relation to anti-dumping - that is, you are dumping unless you can prove otherwise. We have had expressed in this parliament the view that that particular measure is a sensible measure and it should be taken seriously and we should proceed with that.                  That is notwithstanding the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which says the amendments would result in a breach of Australia's international obligations. This is the problem: we have proposals in this parliament for measures that would breach our international trading obligations. Why is that important? Because we rely on the World Trade Organisation to have a set of rules to protect our Australian businesses from unfair practices by others. That is why we have a set of world trading rules, but if we do not play by those rules, if we do not comply with them, we open ourselves up to retaliation. We have had in this parliament, expressed in relation to international carbon-linking, statements about Iran, Venezuela, Syria and Yemen. Those have not come from this side of the parliament but from the other side.                  It reminds me, with this sense of economic Hansonism that is going on, of a statement that was actually made not by a coalition member but by a Labor member, a predecessor of the member for Canberra, who once said that traditionally most of Australia's imports come from overseas. I think that is true, that traditionally they have, but the opposition is on to it now and it has realised that in order to engage in international trade we must engage with foreigners - these rascally, pesky foreigners. The opposition leader is saying he is not against international trade, just so long as it is not with foreigners. The only foreigners that the opposition leader likes are the people smugglers, to whom he is saying, 'Start your engines; come on down!'                   Mr Pyne: Mr Speaker, I simply ask: is it in order for the Prime Minister to claim 20 questions when in fact only 19 have been asked?

  What a remarkable question from the Leader of the Opposition who is on the public record as supporting a carbon tax, who is on the public record as supporting a carbon price and who has said consistently only one thing to the Australian people - that is, that the only thing he believes in is what he thinks the politics of the moment is telling him. That is the only thing he believes in. Historically and famously he was referred to by the member for Wentworth as a weathervane, someone who has no core beliefs about Australia's future and no ability to shape that future. He has no concern about jobs in the future, no concern for pensioners or for family payments in the future and no concern for cutting taxes.                 Tomorrow this House of Representatives will vote on putting a price on carbon. This House of Representatives will record its vote on whether we believe climate change is real; on whether we believe that the most efficient way of addressing climate change is to put a price on carbon pollution; on whether we believe in protecting Australian jobs; on whether we believe that pensioners and people who are raising families deserve extra assistance; and on whether we believe we should be providing tax cuts to working people earning less than $80,000 a year and, particularly, providing the biggest tax cuts to people on lower incomes. These will be the things that go for a vote tomorrow.                 What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that each and every step of the way he has found a way to twist and turn in this debate. He used to be in favour of pricing carbon; now he says he is opposed. I can understand the Leader of the Opposition being here today advocating further delay in putting a price on carbon. I can understand that because the Leader of the Opposition senses what the Australian people will ultimately come to know - that his so-called promise to repeal a price on carbon is just nonsense. He will not repeal a price on carbon if he is ever elected as Prime Minister. He will not do that because more than half of his political party supports putting a price on carbon. He will not do that because to do that would mean repudiating every living Liberal leader. He will not do that because ultimately wiser heads will prevail in the opposition and they will say, 'Don't take money out of the hands of pensioners; don't take money out of the hands of families.' He will not do that and he is not to be believed when he says he will.                 Tomorrow this House will record its vote and every member will be required to file in here and record whether they are on the side of history, whether they are on the side of action, whether they are on the side of change or whether they are content to stand against and watch the world change while Australia stays the same. We, on this side of the parliament, will vote for a clean energy future, for reducing carbon pollution, for enabling economic growth without increases in carbon pollution and for putting more money in the hands of pensioners, working Australians who need it the most, people raising families. We will make sure, more importantly than almost anything else, that we seize the jobs and opportunities that come with a clean energy future.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question because the thing that is at the centre of his question is jobs - jobs for the Australian people, jobs for working Australians. I can understand why the opposition greeted it with scoffing, because they do not care about jobs.                 In the days since this parliament last met the government has announced its intention to have an Asian century white paper. Almost every Australian would be able to give you chapter and verse about the resources boom - about the boom in mining. Many Australians participate in it themselves, live in a community that is affected by the growth in mining or have a family member who is affected by the growth in mining. People understand that there is a resources boom and that it is a good thing. It is a great thing for our country because it means jobs, opportunity and prosperity - with more than $400 billion of investment in the pipeline. At the same time many Australians say to themselves, 'It's fantastic that there's such record pricing for the things that we have to sell, but what happens in the days beyond the resources boom when we have fully exploited our mineral wealth, when we have extracted it and exported it? What happens in those days? What will those Australians do for jobs then, what will their children do?' These are questions on the minds of Australians as they contemplate the future.                 The Asian century white paper will be about speaking to Australians about the opportunities that come from growth in our region. And those opportunities are more than the opportunities from the resources boom; they are about the spectacular development of the middle classes in Asia, with growth of 1.2 billion people in the Asian middle class by 2020 - people who will want to buy our food and our wine, want to come here on holidays, want legal services, accounting services and international education, providing opportunities right across the Australian economy. But we face a challenge and the challenge in these days of the resources boom, as the Australian dollar is high and sustained, is how to make sure industries feeling the pressure of that high, sustained Australian dollar also maintain their competitiveness. That is why we focused in the Future Jobs Forum on working with those industries during the days of the patchwork economy - because I want to see us sustain economic diversity during these days and in the days beyond the resources boom. I want to see us come out with a more diversified economy rather than a less diversified economy. That is what the Future Jobs Forum was about. Interestingly, the tax forum was also about those questions of the patchwork economy. They were centrally before the tax forum in the reform propositions that people worked through.                 We are determined to seize this future. It is about the mineral resource rent tax - so we can take tax from the turbocharged section of the economy and use it to support businesses elsewhere. It is about the NBN and the benefits of a high-technology future. It is about responding to the demands of a patchwork economy and making sure we are doing what we can to support Australian industry. It is, too, about seizing a clean energy future. We cannot be left behind as the world seizes clean energy jobs. We do not intend to have Australia left behind. We will fully seize the opportunities that come from this future.

  I welcome very much the question from the shadow minister for foreign affairs, although we do wonder how much longer the Leader of the Opposition will have confidence in the shadow minister for foreign affairs given his statement the other day about the good old member for Kooyong. He said:                 _ it's nice to have someone in the parliamentary party who understands foreign affairs at last.                 Now, Julie, that is a ringing vote of endorsement if ever I heard one - and, Josh: just remain calm.                     I also appreciate very much the shadow minister for foreign affairs' discovery of the fact that as foreign minister of Australia I do travel abroad. As I have said in various fora around Australia when asked this, the universal conclusion of foreign ministers around the world is that most foreigners do live abroad. That is why we travel abroad to meet those foreigners. I thank very much the shadow minister for foreign affairs for drawing that basic fact to our attention. My own view - and I share this very much with the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for foreign affairs - is that there comes a stage when point-scoring over the cost of overseas travel by political figures demeans our national self-respect.                     They protest! The author of those remarks was John Winston Howard in his most recent book, Lazarus Rising. And I think that actually goes to the maturity which is lacked in this place on the part of those opposite when it comes to the necessity of either a prime minister or a foreign minister travelling abroad in Australia's national interest.                 I also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs that when it comes to global action the shadow minister for foreign affairs should contemplate a few basic facts. She should contemplate the fact that we have around the world at present a large number of economies which have already introduced or are in the process of introducing emissions trading schemes. We also have evidence around the world that in, for example, the People's Republic of China or India we see actions of a type we have not seen in previous decades. In 2009 China added 37 gigawatts of renewable power capacity - more than any other country in the world. India has introduced a tax on coal which is expected to generate funds for further research into clean energies. The UK, run by the Tories, has set an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by 2025. And the Republic of Korea has a 2020 emissions reduction pledge to reduce emissions by 20 per cent below business as usual - not to mention Japan, which has a target to improve its energy efficiency by 30 per cent by 2030.                 What does all this indicate? It says that there are governments and political parties around the world who recognise the future, recognise the need to act on climate change and recognise the need to put a price on carbon - and there are those who keep their heads stuck firmly in the ground and who refuse to do so. We are acting for this nation's future; you are denying this nation a future.                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs table the section of Lazarus Rising from which he has been reading?

  I thank the member for Robertson for what is a very important question, because tomorrow in this House we will vote on one of the most important economic reforms in a generation, and it is going to be a test for each and every one of us in this House. Are we going to face up to the climate science and do something about carbon pollution? Are we going to face up to the fact that we should not leave for our children and our grandchildren greater costs and the heavy burden of carbon pollution? And are we going to show the Australian people and subsequent generations that we have the guts to face up to the tough economic reforms that will deliver prosperity for future generations?                 As for us on this side of the House, we are going to act on all of those challenges because we understand that in the 21st century to be a first-class economy you must be powered by clean energy. That is why it is so important that we do put a price on every tonne of carbon pollution emitted by the biggest polluters. We on this side of the House understand that we need to send a price signal to drive the investment in clean energy and in renewable energy. We understand the importance of that in the 21st century if we want to continue to be a strong economy.                 One of the reasons that Australia is so strong, one of the reasons that the International Monetary Fund gives our economy such a big tick, is that governments over the past 25 to 30 years have had the guts to face up to the big economic reforms. That is why we are strong now; that is why we are resilient now - because governments took the long-term view. And the long-term view is the one that is right for our country. It may not be the most immediately politically popular course of action, but it is right for our country. That is why we on this side of the House will be supporting a clean energy future tomorrow when those critical votes come through. Those on the opposite side of the House will be saying no as they constantly do, turning their back on the future, turning their back on their children and their grandchildren, turning their back on future economic prosperity. All of the modelling shows that our economy can grow strongly with a price on carbon, that incomes can grow strongly while putting a price on carbon pollution.                  And we know what those opposite will also do. They will rip away the essential tax reforms that we are putting in place - essential reforms which will see another one million people taken out of the tax system because we are going to triple the tax-free threshold. They will take the claw out and claw that back. What those opposite will also do is claw back the pension increases. They will claw them back because they do not have a positive approach to the future. They want to turn their back on the future, rip away that assistance and ignore what must be done to grow our economy, to grow jobs and to ensure future prosperity. They only know one course of action. That is to say no, to wreck and to turn their back on the future.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Whilst it is true that there is uncertainty and it is also true that there is volatility in the global economy, it also true that the Australian economy remains relatively strong. The shadow Treasurer quoted a number of authorities before. Indeed, he quoted the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund has been to Australia. It has produced what is called its article IV report. That has come out in the last couple of weeks in full. Do you know what the IMF does in that report? It gives a big tick to carbon pricing.                 The very report that the shadow Treasurer quotes to seek to say that we should defer carbon pricing is the one that gives it a very big tick. It is a comprehensive report on the Australian economy but he did not read the report. He is just that sloppy all of the time. The fact is that the IMF have given carbon pricing in Australia a big tick - indeed, as they have given the government's economic management a very big tick. What I need to do now is to quote from that report. It is only a couple of weeks old. It says:                 Australia's performance since the onset of the global financial crisis has been enviable.                 That is, it says the Australian economy is strong and it says the Australian economy is in good shape - and it says it is strong and in good shape for a couple of reasons.                 First of all, it says what a good job this government did during the global financial crisis to support our economy and avoid going into recession. Then it points to the fact that over the years fundamental economic reforms have been implemented by governments from both sides of politics to strengthen our economy. It talks about the big reforms of the past in IMF report after IMF report: the floating of the dollar, the bringing down of the tariff wall, national competition policy, national superannuation - all of the big reforms that have strengthened our economy.                 It is in that context that the International Monetary Fund supports putting an overall price on carbon. The hide of the shadow Treasurer to come into this House and quote the International Monetary Fund, which has given the government's economic policies a big tick and which supports carbon pricing, is just so typical of those opposite. They are so negative. They have their heads stuck so far in the sand they cannot see the wood for the trees. These people are completely and utterly impossible.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. Of course, the House will consider further later today the government's clean energy legislative package. It is an extremely important reform for this country. He has referred to the carbon pricing mechanism in his question. Around 500 of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases will carry a liability under the carbon price mechanism. There are of course, in relation to some forms of off-road fuel usage, arrangements that the legislation will put in place to apply an effective carbon price to them.                 I am aware of the fact that the member for O'Connor has put forward an amendment this morning that relates to this issue. I would like to assure him that the government is looking very carefully at it. We understand the concerns that he is raising and recognise that he is representing the concerns that would have been raised with him by people within his electorate. I am working in my office and seeking some advice about the implications of the amendment that has been put forward.                 I note in this context that it is important to always bear in mind that, in relation to the effective carbon pricing arrangements that the government is proposing to apply to various areas of off-road fuel usage, there will be no effective carbon price applied in relation to light commercial vehicles. So Australian motorists will not be facing an effective carbon price in relation to their fuel usage. We will have a look at the proposed amendment and have some further discussions with the member for O'Connor about those particular issues.                 To conclude, it is also important to note that in rural and regional Australia the exemptions in relation to off-road usage that apply to the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors are also very important considerations. We will have a look at the issues that the member has raised and have further discussions with him in relation to them.

  I thank the member for Wills for his question. As the House is aware, this morning the second reading debate on the government's clean energy legislation package resumed. As I said a moment ago, this is a very important environmental and economic reform for this country. This evening, of course, we expect to be able to proceed to the consideration in detail stage in relation to the bills before a final vote tomorrow morning on both the clean energy bills and another bill that is before the House: the government's steel transformation plan.                 This is a crucial economic reform. It is central to assuring this country's economic prosperity and competitiveness in the years ahead. The Clean Energy Future package will deliver very significant benefits to the economy over time, including a very significant increase in investment in clean energy. The Treasury modelling that the Treasurer referred to a short while ago predicts, in fact, that the carbon price will drive around $100 billion of investment in the renewable energy sector over the period to 2050, and it will transform our energy sector and create a considerable number of jobs. Those jobs will not be just in new industries and renewable technologies; they will also support jobs in what we would describe as the more traditional areas of the economy, including in construction, electrical services and many areas of manufacturing. The modelling shows that employment will increase in our economy by 1.6 million jobs to the year 2020.                 At the same time, of course, the scheme that the government will introduce will be environmentally effective. The carbon price arrangements will see emissions reduced in our economy by at least 160 million tonnes in the year 2020 and ongoing. That is the least reduction in emissions that we can expect from the arrangements to be put in place.                  Time and time again in our economic history it is the Labor Party that has made the reforms that are so crucial to future prosperity and intergenerational equity, and time and time again it is the coalition that have sided with vested interests against the interests of the nation and the Australian people generally. Let us not forget the fact that they opposed Medicare, they opposed compulsory superannuation and now they are opposing this reform. Medicare, compulsory superannuation and this reform all promote intergenerational equity. They will promote social equity. They will improve the environment. They are institutional changes that have ensured our economy remains competitive.                 We heard earlier in question time that the Leader of the Opposition proposes to oppose the steel transformation plan - and this is after he has been running around trying to terrify people about their jobs in the industry. Once again, hypocrisy. This package that is before the House will be environmentally effective, it will be economically efficient and it will be socially equitable. The household assistance that the government is providing will ensure that nine out of 10 households receive assistance through either the tax reform and the tax cuts that will be implemented or the increase in Commonwealth benefits, like the 1.7 per cent increase in pensions. It will be a very important and equitable reform for the nation.

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and it is clear that the campaign of deceit continues. That question has been put together in order to pretend to the Australian people that price rises in things like electricity are somehow associated with the actions of this government. The member is better than that; the member knows that is untrue and he should not come into this parliament and pretend that it is true. It is completely false, calculated to create a climate of fear, completely disrespectful to the people of Australia. As the member knows, if he is seriously concerned about questions like rises in electricity pricing and water pricing, he may want to have a discussion with his state colleagues, particularly Premier Baillieu, who is on the record -                      as supporting a price on carbon. I understand that because of a set of questions relating to investment in infrastructure particularly that electricity prices have been rising. They have been rising under Premier Baillieu; they have been rising under Premier Barnett in Western Australia. At least Premier Barnett has had the honesty to go out to the Western Australian people and explain how the price rises are associated with the need for investment in infrastructure in Western Australia - that is, the price rises are there because of a set of reasons associated with state governments. The same, of course, is true with water infrastructure, including investments that are being made in new capacity. So no-one should fall for the misleading attempt that the member has engaged in. It is completely disrespectful to Australian people.                 On the question of price impacts of carbon pricing - despite these many, many months of fear, smear and running away from the facts and despite the Leader of the Opposition each and every day going out there and saying to the Australian people things that are untrue - what the member knows -                      What every member of this parliament knows is that the flow through price impact of asking the biggest polluters in our country to pay the price of their carbon pollution to Australians is less than one per cent - 0.7 per cent - of CPI. It is as a result of that flow through price change of less than one per cent of CPI - less than a cent in a dollar - that the government has determined it is appropriate to use more than half of the revenue generated by carbon pricing to help pensioners with an increase of $338, to help people raising children with an increase in family payments, to help Australians earning less than $80,000 a year with a tax cut and to associate that tax change with a major tax reform, which will mean one million Australians will not be in the tax system, will not pay any tax and will see each and every week the rewards for working.                  I would say to the member who asked the question and who in other iterations of his political life has been prepared to contemplate reforms, including reforms like carbon pricing, that perhaps instead of following the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign, he should listen to a former Liberal leader, and I am referring to Dr John Hewson, who has appeared in this book, the 'Say Yes Campaign Book'. He is the former employer of the Leader of the Opposition - that was a bad decision, but he has made one good one. He says:                 I say yes to carbon pricing, because this is the most important thing we can do for our nation this century.                 A former Liberal leader joining every other living liberal Leader in favour of carbon pricing, all except the wrecker over here.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She knows that this government is determined to act in the national interest to introduce a price on carbon pollution. She also knows that this government is determined to make sure that it is the big polluters that pay for carbon pollution and not Australian families and pensioners. We want to make sure that acting on climate change continues to be in the interests of the economy and in the interests of our children.                 Under our plan to put a price on carbon pollution we do intend to provide support to pensioners; 3.4 million pensioners will receive assistance. That assistance amounts to $338 for single pensioners each year and $255 a year for each member of a pensioner couple. Very importantly for pensioners, both the pension and the clean energy supplement will increase over time to make sure that the assistance that we do provide to pensioners will keep up with the cost of living. It is also the case that under our plan to put a price on carbon pollution we intend to provide support to nine out of 10 households. Nine out of 10 households will receive support and that will include three million low-income households who will receive assistance over and above their expected increased prices. All of these increases in payments and pensions will be very important for all of those Australians. It will also be the case that these increases in payments will go straight into the bank accounts of families and straight into the bank accounts of pensioners - no extra forms or queues for people to worry about.                 What we know is that the Leader of the Opposition has a very different plan to this. What he intends to do is act in his own interest, not in the nation's interest. What this Leader of the Opposition is going to do is to make sure that he gives the bill for dealing with carbon pollution to families and to pensioners. We know that that will amount to Australian families being $1,300 a year worse off as a result of his changes. Even worse, we know that this Leader of the Opposition intends to claw back the assistance that this government will provide to pensioners and to families.                     I hear the member for Herbert up there making a right royal noise about the clawback that this Leader of the Opposition is going to do. That will mean 17,400 pensioners in Herbert will have their assistance clawed back. The party of Fightback is now the party of clawback.

  The kind of question we often get from the Leader of the Opposition - it is always heavy on the drama. What it has never got in it is any facts and what we never hear is any alternatives that make any sense. The Leader of the Opposition never campaigns on his so-called direct action plan, a plan to subsidise polluters, because he knows it will not work and it does not add up.                 The Leader of the Opposition is here today with all of this dramatic carry-on because he knows once a carbon price is legislated and commences to operate then the fear campaigns he has been engaged in will be exposed as absolute nonsense. He knows that he will not ever repeal carbon pricing. He will go running around like a headless chook in hyperactive mode trying to pretend to everybody that he will, but he knows this: that significant figures in the Liberal Party support putting a price on carbon - every living Liberal leader except this Leader of the Opposition. He knows that once it is in place money will start to flow to pensioners and to families and to providing workers with tax cuts. He knows that in the past he has been incredibly in favour of putting a price on carbon, and so his rhetoric about repealing the carbon price will be seen through by the Australian people.                 The Leader of the Opposition has the temerity to come in here and talk about jobs. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: in the carbon-pricing package we are providing literally billions of dollars to work with Australian industry to support Australian jobs. We will be there working with Australian industry to support those jobs, in manufacturing, in steel, as well as seizing the clean energy opportunities of the future and the jobs that come with that. The Leader of the Opposition, who has been in and out of factories trying to associate himself with working people - the same working people he ran a mile from during the days of Work Choices - is now saying to those steelworkers that he stood alongside: 'I could help your industry by voting for a $300 million steel transformation plan but I won't do it. The politics is more important to me than supporting your job.' We, in the votes today and tomorrow, will be supporting the jobs of steelworkers. The Leader of the Opposition will sit in that chair and vote against their jobs.                 On the question of jobs, last week we had the Future Jobs Forum. The input of the opposition? Apart from cutting assistance to the automobile industry, apart from having no plan for skills except cutbacks to apprenticeships, apart from having no plan for the economy except desperately trying to cover up their planned $70 billion of cuts to services, what does the opposition stand for? It certainly is not jobs. No plans for the jobs of Australians at all, and they are bored by the discussion of it.                 Every time we have talked about carbon pricing in this country, figures in the opposition have thought up a new reason to delay. Well, history is marching on. We are going to get this done. This House of Representatives is going to get this done tomorrow. We will be there voting on the side of history. The Leader of the Opposition will be writing his name into history as the biggest wrecker to ever serve in a leadership role in Australian politics.

                   To the Leader of the Opposition                   I say you are being marooned by the tide of history. Your question could not make it clearer. As history has marched past you in this parliament today, there you are, standing on the sidelines, relentless negativity the order of the day. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition                   that the plan that has passed this House of Representatives                   today to put a price on carbon means that we will cut taxes for Australian                   working people. We will cut taxes for Australians                   who earn less than $80,000 a year. We will increase the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 - tripling it. We will make sure that there are a million people who are not in the tax system. We will increase payments for family payments. We will increase pensions; 1.8 million pensioner households will on average come out $210 in front.                   And who is the threat to all of this? Who is the threat to the living standards of Australians? Who seeks to impose upon them an additional cost? Who is the threat? It is the Leader of the Opposition                   with his reckless plan to impose a burden of $1,300 on Australians                   taxpayers. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition                   to accept that this House of Representatives                   today has chosen to put a price on carbon pollution, to make our biggest polluters pay the price of the carbon pollution they generate, to use that money to increase pensions and to cut taxes, to protect Australian                   jobs and to seize a clean-energy future. And there the Leader of the Opposition                   sits, marooned with his negativity, wanting to put an extra tax on taxpayers and give that money to the big polluters - too stubborn, too relentlessly negative to even come into this parliament and vote to support steelworkers' jobs, a remarkable choice embracing negativity after days and days of campaigning and trying to instil fear into those very workers.                   This House of Representatives                   has decided today to seize the future. As we go out and grab that future with both hands, there will be the Leader of the Opposition                   on the sidelines, saying no with no policies to guide him, as always.

                   I thank the member for Greenway for her question. To the member for Greenway and to all of my colleagues I say the following. To the people of Australia                   I say the following. We have debated climate change in this parliament and beyond for more than 10 years. There have been reports. There have been inquiries. There have been debates. There have been votes over a long period of time. When you look at all of those inquiries and all of those reports, when you look at what the scientists have had to say, when you look at what the economists and experts have had to say, some things become blindingly clear.                   I believe after all of that debate the vast majority of Australians                   belie                   ve that climate change is real. The vast majority of Australians believe it is caused by carbon pollution made by human beings. The majority of Australians want to see that carbon pollution reduced. The majority of Australians want to see action on climate change. Across all of those reports and inquiries, what has also become clear is that the cheapest way to seize a clean energy future is to put a price on carbon pollution, to make sure that the biggest polluters pay. That is the cheapest way to change our economy so it is a cleaner economy with clean energy. After all of those words, after all of those committee reports, after all of those inquiries, today this House of Representatives moved from words to deeds. It has moved from what has sometimes been a rancorous debate to action. This House of Representatives today, this parliament today, has seized the future. This parliament today has grabbed the future with both hands. That future will be one about clean energy jobs, it will be about a better environment, it will be about cutting taxes and increasing pensions and it will be about making sure our country is not left behind as the world moves to a clean energy future.                 To my Labor colleagues I say I am proud of their courage and fortitude in this debate, and they too in turn can be proud that this is a reform with Labor values right at its heart. This is a reform in the Labor tradition of Medicare and superannuation. This is a reform hotly contested at the time, but like Labor reforms of the past - like the Labor reforms of Medicare and superannuation - they are the reforms that have built the nation we are proud to live in today. History will record that a clean energy future started today with this vote. I thank members of parliament who have had the courage to seize this future for their fortitude. They have made an important decision for the nation, an important decision that will see us cut carbon pollution, that will see us cut taxes, that will see us increase pensions, that will see us protect Australian jobs and that will see us lock in a growth of 1.6 million jobs by 2020 and strong economic growth. This is a reform to shape the future. It has taken determination, and today we have got this done.

  I say to the member who has raised this question that he should look to measures that the government has and is providing, like the instant tax write-off for new assets for small businesses, an important measure increased to $6,500, an important measure for small businesses. I also say to the member who has engaged in the stunt today of walking to the dispatch box: what does he say to those small businesses about the opposition's plan to impose a cost - whether it was imposed on families or small business we are still waiting for clarification -                      On the carbon-pricing legislation which has passed the parliament today: first, and despite the continued misrepresentations of the opposition, the people who will pay the price on carbon are the biggest polluters in this country. I refer the opposition to the legislation that in their relentless negativity they have voted against. I refer the opposition to the fact that the money paid -                      I refer the opposition to the fact that the money raised by putting a price on carbon, paid by those biggest polluters, will be used to put more money in the hands of Australian taxpayers, those who need it the most, more money in the hands of Australian pensioners - indeed, pensioner households, 1.8 million of them, will on average come out in front - and more money in the hands of those who have family payments.                      They are the people that go and use the services of small businesses. The member for Dunkley might want to think about that. They are the people who go and buy things from small businesses. Yes, we have been upfront all along in saying that there will be a price impact - 0.7 per cent, less than a cent in a dollar - and that is why we have provided extra money to families and to pensioners as they continue to consume the services from those small business people.                  I do invite a contrast with a plan which would enable the alternative government, if it were ever elected, to pick winners and drag money out of families and small businesses to pay for it. I also say the following about the government's plan and, in saying it, I refer the House to the following words, because they are very wise words and the House should be reminded of them. My attention has been drawn to a statement which says the following:                    It was actually the coalition that instigated work on the emissions trading scheme. In fact, I have in my hand a report that I helped author back in 1998 which talks about regulatory arrangements for trading in greenhouse gas emissions - 1998!                  _Â Â Â _Â Â Â _                 The coalition's commitment to an ETS is demonstrable.                 Words from the member for Dunkley. It is a pity -                      It is a very great pity that, fuelled by hypocrisy, he did not vote consistently with those words today.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question. She is a very enthusiastic supporter of clean energy, as is everybody on this side of the House because we know that a price on carbon will drive that investment particularly in renewable energy - in the wind, in the solar, in the geothermal. Of course, there were those on the other side of the House who once believed in tackling climate change, like the member for Dunkley -                      or like the member for North Sydney. History will judge those harshest who have changed their mind for rank political opportunism. We on this side of the House are passionate believers in a clean energy future. History will judge those harshly on that side of the House who profess to believe in climate change but have voted against it in this House. What we have seen is empty political opportunism from those opposite because saying no is not a solution to dealing with climate change. What we must do is put in place the significant long-term reforms to drive investment in renewable energy and have the political courage to face up to the future and put in place the long-term reforms that will guarantee our prosperity into the future. Putting a price on carbon pollution is one such long-term reform.                 What we have seen from the IMF and many other bodies is that the Australian economy is resilient today because in the past politicians in this House had the courage to face up to the long-term reforms. Politicians particularly in this House had the courage to face up to the challenge of the global financial crisis. We on this side of the House voted for jobs in the face of the global financial crisis; those on that side of the House voted against jobs. What motivates everybody on this side of the House is that our No. 1 priority is to support jobs and to support jobs in a clean energy future; to support the green jobs of the future and to support our workers, particularly in the steel industry, which is opposed as well by those opposite.                 As a consequence of our actions we avoided recession in this country. Tens of thousands of people kept their jobs because we on this side of the House had the political courage to vote for what was right, not for what was politically opportunistic at the time. The consequence is our economy today is almost six per cent larger than prior to the global financial crisis and we have one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the developed world. If those people opposite had had their way, tens of thousands of people would have lost their jobs.                 We on this side of the House will do what is right for the future of the country. We on this side of the House will support clean energy. We, with others in this House, understand the importance of putting in place long-term policies for the future. And of course, when judgment is ultimately made, those opposite will be judged as wreckers, as being on the wrong side of history.

  Thank you, Mr Speaker -                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I say to the member's question - and as I do so I look at those in the gallery who are properly exercising the privilege of being there, and I can see in the gallery children who are here today with their parents - that what I would say to those families is this is a reform the Australian nation needs for the children we see seated in the gallery today. This is a reform for those children. An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was referring to the future of some of the children I see in the gallery and the children who are beyond the gallery today. The member asked me why someone should support putting a price on carbon, and in answer to her I would say that people would support putting a price on carbon because they care about the Australia that those children will become adults in.                   An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, I was referring to this nation's future and to the future that the children of this nation will have in the nation that they will grow up in.                   An incident having occurred in the gallery -                  I assume that most of the serious people are still there and those who think this is a joke will be down taking interviews of the protestors.                  But we have got to a stage where I am actually getting messages about whether I am considering clearing the galleries. What I will tell you is that I am not. But, if there is anybody else in the gallery who wants to get something off their chest, do it now and then leave by themselves, because the rest of the people are here to view proceedings. The only alternative that I do have is to clear the galleries, and I will not be doing that. But I am not endangering those who are employed by the parliament to keep order in the galleries. I hope that some people might think of that and that anybody who can do anything to assist the orderly behaviour of the galleries would do so. The Prime Minister.                     For that Australia of the future, I believe that Australians do want to see us tackle climate change, that they want this generation and the generations that lie beyond to grow up in an Australia where our economic growth is no longer dependent on carbon pollution growing. I believe they want to see children grow up in an Australia that has a better environment, where we are walking more lightly on our planet than we do today. I believe they want to see an Australia where young people, middle-aged people and older people have the opportunity to get clean energy jobs. They do not want to see this nation lose the global race for a clean energy future. They want us to have our share of those opportunities here.                      I believe they would want to see an Australia where we direct our resources to those who need those resources the most, which is why with putting a price on carbon we have deliberately designed the assistance that goes to households so it assists those Australians who need that assistance the most - like pensioners, like people who earn less than $80,000 a year, like families raising children.                  I would say to the member that when she contemplates the circumstances of those families she may want to contemplate the alternative that the opposition says it believes in, where more money will need to come from those families to give to the biggest polluters, whilst of course the scheme that this House of Representatives has passed today is a scheme where we get the money from the biggest polluters, creating an incentive for them to reduce their carbon pollution, and use that revenue to assist Australians who need that assistance the most.                 I would say more generally to those on the floor of this parliament that the obligation which comes with sitting in this parliament, and it is a heavy obligation, is not to agree with everyone who raises their voice; it is to do the right thing for the nation's future. That is what this House of Representatives has done today.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and I thank him for supporting our opportunity today to seize a clean energy future. I thank him for his support. All through this debate and discussion in the House of Representatives and beyond, people have been concerned at our ability to work with Australian employers and ensure that we protect Australian jobs. The package of legislation that the House of Representatives has passed today does protect Australian jobs. There are some important programs directed towards helping Australian businesses seize a clean energy future. They are directed in part to businesses in the food sector and to businesses like foundries; but they are also directed beyond - assistance as Australian businesses seize a clean energy future.                 I have been asked specifically about the commencement date of the clean technology programs. This is an important suite of programs: $1.2 billion to directly help improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon pollution in manufacturing industries. We have particularly recognised the circumstances of food processors and set aside $150 million for them to move to cleaner technology. Last month the government released a discussion paper on the operation of this $1.2 billion suite of clean technology programs. The department that is relevant to this, the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, is consulting with stakeholders to make sure that the very specific design of this program works well to meet their needs. It is anticipated that the first funding from this program will be awarded in May 2012 and a call for applications will be launched in the first half of 2012.                 The member also asked me about the Biodiversity Fund. This is also a very important part of the measures we are taking to ensure our nation seizes a clean energy future. These are complementary to the foundation stone of a carbon price. The government will establish an ongoing biodiversity fund with funding of $946 million over its first six years to support landholders that undertake projects to establish, restore, protect or manage biodiverse carbon stores. This is about our unique Australian environment and keeping it for the future. Mr Speaker, I can advise the House in answer to the member's question that the government expects to appoint an interim board shortly to further the delivery of these land sector measures under the Biodiversity Fund. The government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the funding under the Biodiversity Fund begins this year, and to that end we expect draft guidelines to be released over summer, with the initial allocation of funding likely to be announced in the first quarter of 2012.                  These are important measures, but they stand on the foundation stone of putting a price on carbon, the cheapest way of ensuring that we seize a clean energy future.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. He has had a very long-term interest in the legislation that has been passed by the House this morning. It is legislation that will of course in the years to come be seen as a very important economic and environmental reform. The bills that the House passed this morning build on over two decades worth of consultation, work with industry, work with environment groups, negotiation, inquiry and many years of scientific work, and I am pleased to say, as the Prime Minister said earlier, that the House of Representatives has passed on this occasion from words to deeds. We are tackling climate change.                 Subject to the consideration of the Senate, upon passage of the legislation, from 1 July next year Australia will have a price on carbon pollution. That will mean that the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in our economy will be obliged to acquire a permit or a carbon unit for each tonne of pollution that they produce and it will generate a very strong incentive to cut pollution and to invest in cleaner energy sources. It is a reform that is economically efficient, is environmentally effective and will be socially equitable. The fact of the matter is that by applying a market mechanism, an emissions trading scheme, the government's carbon price mechanism is the most cost-effective way to cut our greenhouse gas emissions. Business will have certainty about carbon pricing, and investment in long-lived assets, in particular in the energy sector, will be unlocked, with this uncertainty over carbon pricing resolved. Australia will begin to build a clean energy future. Billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy is anticipated. The government's plan will be environmentally effective because we will be setting caps on carbon each year when we move to emissions trading, and the caps will mean that by 2020 at least 160 million tonnes of emissions will be cut in that year. The new Climate Change Authority will be advising governments in years to come on the pollution caps necessary to make long-term emissions reductions.                 Very importantly, the plan that the government has put forward that has been carried by the House this morning is socially equitable because nine out of 10 households will receive assistance to meet very modest price impacts. In fact, over four million low-income households will receive assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than their expected price impact. The tax-free threshold will be trebled. A million people will be released from the lodgement of a taxation return. Significant benefits will be delivered for low- and middle-income earners, including for many women, casual and part-time workers.                  This is a Labor reform through and through. In this parliament this legislation was formulated by government members and members on the multiparty climate change committee. Finally, I would like to thank the crossbenchers who participated so constructively and with such courtesy in the proceedings of that committee. I am very confident that, once this legislation has finally passed the parliament, those who supported it will be seen as having acted in the best interests of future generations and those who opposed it will be exposed through the hollow fear campaign that they have conducted.

  Certainly I do believe that truth in politics is very important and I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to her statement in September 2008:                 The Liberal Party has a policy of both protecting the planet and protecting Australia. We support, in principle, an Emissions Trading Scheme _.                 Was she telling the truth then or did she tell the truth by the way she voted today because both cannot possibly be the truth, can they?

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: what an extraordinary question in a week in which one of his shadow ministers has been named for gross disorder in this House. If he is interested in questions of conduct in parliament then he might address whether or not the member for Indi should be sitting on his front bench. While he is at it, he should make a series of other decisions as well.                 Yesterday the clean energy legislation went through this parliament. I think it is a good thing that this parliament has decided to cut carbon pollution. That is the right thing to do. I think it is a good thing that we have decided to reach our bipartisan target of a five per cent reduction in carbon pollution in the cheapest possible way. I think it is a good thing that we have put a price on carbon so we can unleash $100 billion of new investment in clean and renewable energy. I think it is a good thing that this parliament yesterday decided to triple the tax free threshold so that secondary income earners going out to work - often women making the choice to return to work, perhaps part time after having a child - and people making a journey from welfare to work see more of the benefits of that work straightaway, that we see a million people out of the tax system, that we make it easier for them to get to work and to enjoy the fruits of their labours in their hands through their pay packets rather than being taken away by the tax system.                 I think it is a good thing that we are providing extra assistance to pensioners. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the package has been designed so that on average pensioners will come out in front. They will have more money at their disposal than they do now. I think that is a good thing to help the pensioners of Australia. I also think it is a good thing that we are providing tax cuts to people who earn less than $80,000. Many of them will see a tax cut of $300. Some of them will see a tax cut of more than that. I think it is a good thing that we are providing those tax cuts.                 I understand that the Leader of the Opposition - because he has no policies that will work, because he always says no - will come into this parliament day after day and seek to continue to prosecute his fear campaign in the Australian community. But the one thing I say about the continued prosecution of that fear campaign is: Australians will ultimately be able to judge what it is worth as carbon pricing comes into effect on 1 July next year. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: whatever his words - having lived through the election promise of a rock solid ironclad guarantee and having seen that promise smashed by the Leader of the Opposition - no-one is going to believe him about taking carbon pricing away because he is not to be believed on this question.                 The Leader of the Opposition will huff and puff about carbon pricing but he knows, as I know, that around half the people who sit behind him are in favour of carbon pricing. The people who sit on his front bench have been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. He has been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. Former Prime Minister Howard has been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. The Leader of the Opposition will find it hard to keep covering up the fact that the Liberal Party has absolutely no real intention to ever take this carbon pricing away.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I would say to the member for Deakin, as I say to other members of the government and other members with good will in this parliament, I know the focus of government members is on the jobs of Australians, the prosperity of Australians and making sure that we give Australia the best possible environment it can have for the future.                 On the question of jobs, I think that we should note that today statistics have come out that show that the economy added over 20,000 jobs last month. That is on top of the 750,000 jobs created since this government came to office. Having a robust economy that can create jobs is not a matter of accident. It is not a matter of neglect. It is not a matter of autopilot. It takes careful and continued policy work and reform. It is no accident that our economy today is a resilient economy. It has been built painstakingly by reforms over generations, particularly the reforms to open our economy to the world under the Hawke and Keating governments, particularly reforms like embracing a pool of national savings through superannuation and particularly the work this government did to support jobs during the days of the global financial crisis. If we are to see jobs and prosperity in the future, then we cannot afford to say no in the face of the challenges of the future. We have to get out there and seize those challenges. Our climate is changing. Our planet is warming. That has risks and consequences -                      I thank the clearest spokesperson for the Liberal Party, who, when I say 'climate change is real', chants, 'No, it's not'! I thank him for outing the fact that the Liberal Party is in the arms of climate change sceptics and deniers. I think Australians need to know that. Obviously, the member for Tangney is being constrained now, by a parliamentary friend, from continuing to tell us about the climate change scepticism and denial of the Liberal Party. But our climate is changing, our planet is warming and that has consequences for our country. In the face of those consequences, we can say no and just drift into a future with more dangerous climate change or we can say that we will shape that future, we will cut carbon pollution, we will ensure that there are clean-energy jobs and we will do this in the fairest possible way, the Labor way - helping pensioners, helping families with kids, helping Australians who need tax cuts the most. We can seize this clean energy future, as this House of Representatives did yesterday, or we can do what that Leader of the Opposition does, which is work out on any given day where the political wind is blowing and what he believes in on that day. That is what he has consistently done on climate change. He has been in favour of putting a price on carbon. He has talked approvingly about a carbon tax. Now he has campaigned against a price on carbon. He has feigned concern for steelworkers' jobs. He has voted against steelworkers' jobs in this parliament. And, in the lead-up to the election in 2013, we will see the most ridiculous campaigning of all: the Leader of the Opposition trying to pretend that he seriously wants to take carbon pricing away - a hollow promise from a man that should not be believed, given the weathervane politics he has pursued.

We support, in principle, an Emissions Trading Scheme _                 That was the position of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. So what I cannot quite explain when she comes into this parliament with that question is: why did she vote yesterday against her position? Why did she betray the position that she said was the position of the Liberal Party? Why did she do that - betray the Liberal Party with her vote?

  I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question, because she understands, like all of the government do, that the clean energy legislation package will provide prosperity for this nation into the future. It will build our future prosperity. We on this side of the House wish to reduce carbon pollution for a clean energy future. We understand that business needs certainty and that the largest polluters should pay the price of their pollution. But, because we are a Labor government, we understand that families need a fair go and that certain industries will need help on the path of transition. That is why the package that was passed yesterday will target only the biggest polluters, while nine out of 10 households will be compensated, and it is how we will cut 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution by 2020.                 In the great tradition of Labor, we understand that change in our economy is inevitable. From the 19th century of gold and farming through to the manufacturing story after World War II and now our growing and prosperous services economy, we understand that we cannot resist the future and that to turn our back on the future is selling our people short. We want to move into a low-pollution economy with good jobs, clean technologies, powerful innovation and a sustainable future. We will still be an agricultural producer with the changes we have made. We will still be a manufacturer with the changes we have made. And we will still be producing services, but we will not be a rapidly-expanding carbon producer.                 The Labor government will help people through this change. Not only are we delivering reform but we will be assisting the workforces and families with reskilling and new training. We will make sure that people do not get left behind in the process of economic change. As former Prime Minister Paul Keating remarked on 11 July this year, the pricing mechanism is 'part of the Labor tradition of change, the Labor tradition of the adaptation of the economy'.                 Unfortunately the opposition are stuck in the past. The Leader of the Opposition is a modern-day King Canute who would say that you can turn back the tide. There is no credible plan for the opposition to address climate change. They have the famously misnamed 'direct action plan'. Not a single economist supports it and it will rip away the significant tax cuts and pension increases which are delivered to people under our plan. Former Prime Minister Howard understood the need to be internationally competitive. He understood the importance of getting on with it now. He said at the Melbourne Press Club on 17 July 2007:                 In the years to come it will provide a model for other nations to follow.                 Being among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will bring new opportunities and we intend to grasp them.                 The shadow Treasurer tried to rewrite this history on radio this morning, but he got caught out. We have a problem in this parliament; it is called the opposition. They are crippled by philosophical contradictions. Former Prime Minister Howard supported an ETS. Brendan Nelson supported an ETS. The member for Wentworth probably still supports an ETS. In fact, I suspect that nearly half of those opposite support an ETS, but they are not brave enough or they have been gagged from voting with their conscience. The real issue for our prosperity is you can lie to the people and say to them that you cannot change. Only the conservatives would have you believe you cannot change. We are clear: change is inevitable and we want to help our people move on with it.

  In answer to the member's question, firstly, I would be very happy to work with the member to get additional information to the business that he identifies in his electorate because the power figures he has used and the anticipated increase are not right, cannot be right and if the business believes them to be right then clearly it does not have the full information. The figure he used was something like a 50 per cent increase. Of course, that is not right. I would be very happy to work with the member to get accurate information to that business about any cost changes it should expect to see. I would also be very happy to work with the member to make sure the business that he has identified as a manufacturing business is kept informed of the rollout of the more than $1 billion that has been set aside in the carbon pricing package in order to work with manufacturing for a clean technology future. I would be very happy to work with the member to make sure this business gets that information.                 The member's question highlights that as a result of many, many months of a fear campaign there are many Australians who are anxious but who do not need to be anxious. They have been given the wrong information by the Leader of the Opposition. They have deliberately had their fear and anxiety stoked by the Leader of the Opposition. Those Australians have heard some of the wild and ridiculous claims made about astronomical increases in prices when the impact on households is less than 1c in the dollar or less than one per cent of CPI.                     I am very seriously responding to the member's question because it does concern me that a business that employs 130 people is obviously anxious about a power rise of that magnitude when it will not occur. That does concern me. I am saying to the member that I am very happy to work with him so that he sees all of the information and is able to give it to the business involved. Of course, I would want the business to know about the assistance that is available for a clean technology future. I was going on to make a broader point about the anxiety and fear that has been stoked by false campaigning. I do believe that false campaigning should come to an end and that people should get accurate information about the package. I am very happy to work with the member on doing that.

  I thank the member for New England for his question. He has had a strong interest in this issue throughout the negotiations in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. The government is well aware of the issues raised by meat processors and landfill operators and particularly by local governments with landfill that are associated with the introduction of carbon pricing.                 Recently in Melbourne I met with the Australian Meat Industry Council to discuss the meat processing sector in particular and the opportunities that do exist under the programs that the government has announced with the clean energy package. My department as well has also visited a number of sites, a number of abattoirs, including a visit to Bindaree Beef in Inverell and is going to be making a presentation to a meat industry workshop next week on these issues, so the department and the government are very well engaged.                 Many meat processors have already investigated opportunities to become more energy efficient with the approaching carbon price and also to reduce emissions from their settlement ponds. There are opportunities to capture methane, in particular from the settlement ponds, to generate electricity that would then reduce the need to buy electricity off the grid and also provide the opportunity for those operators to create renewable energy certificates. Some meat processors will be able to take sufficient actions, in fact, we anticipate, to fall below the 25,000 tonne emissions threshold that the member for New England adverted to. In addition, the meat processors will be able to benefit from the $150 million that will be available under the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program which is co-contribution grant funding for food processors to reduce their emissions to improve their energy efficiency. So there are a number of opportunities in that sector to deal with this issue. In relation to local government landfills there are a number of similar issues that I could point to. In particular, one of the amendments that the government moved to the legislation two days ago in the House, and which was carried by the House, dealt with this issue and indeed means that many small landfill operators, particularly local governments, will not be liable under the carbon price mechanism certainly over the first three years of the scheme. That is something that has been welcomed by the Local Government Association.                 Landfills will also be able to meet up to 100 per cent of their liability during the first three years of the scheme from credits created under the Carbon Farming Initiative - another thing that has been welcomed in recent days. In fact, the government estimates that the carbon farming credits created by landfill operators for their legacy methane will actually exceed their liability under the carbon price for their landfill emissions probably until the year 2020 and beyond. So there are some very good opportunities for local governments in the landfill area.                 Yesterday, the president of the Local Government Association issued a press release welcoming all of these initiatives and had this to say:                 ALGA welcomes the outcomes of the parliamentary process and the introduction of a market-based approach to carbon pricing. The amended legislation addresses local government's concerns about the impact of a carbon price on small landfills, many of which are owned by councils.                 Finally, could I just say how important the contributions of ALGA, local governments and, in particular, the members on the cross benches - particularly, the member for New England - have been in bringing about this outcome.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question and for her commitment to a clean energy future. She understands, as her South Australian colleagues understand, just how important it is for Australia's future - particularly for the future of our children - that this legislation is now through the House of Representatives and will mean that we will have a price on carbon from 1 July next year.                 Of course, because we are a Labor government, we will make sure that pensioners and families get the support that they need to make sure they get help to balance their household budgets. We have made sure that before 1 July next year pensioners and families receiving payments will receive a lump sum - that will happen before 1 July next year - and nine out of 10 households will get help to balance their household budgets.                 As the House knows, because of the actions of this side of the parliament, 3.4 million pensioners will not only get the lump sum before 1 July next year but also get an ongoing increase in their pension. What all of these pensioners and all of the families on payments need to know is that every single one of the members of the Liberal and National parties voted no yesterday to stop these increases in payments and to stop the increases in pensions that the parliament will now deliver.                 And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has told us that he is going to roll back these changes. The reality for families and pensioners is that this will mean that this Leader of the Opposition will be increasing taxes and clawing back pension rises and clawing back payments to families. Families also know that they are going to be slugged by the Leader of the Opposition, who is going to impose on each and every family another $1,300 that he is then going to pay to polluters. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do.                 This has all been confirmed very loudly and very proudly by the member for North Sydney. This morning on Radio National he said: 'These are not real pension increases.' They might not be real pension increases to the member for North Sydney but they most certainly are for the more than 10,000 pensioners in North Sydney - 10,000 pensioners in North Sydney who are going to have their money clawed back as a result of this Leader of the Opposition.

  In response to the shadow minister's question, I draw his attention to the fact that the opposition has around 30 speakers listed for the debate. I presume he would be interested in listening to their contributions. I would also remind the shadow minister that initially when the legislation and the question of its progress through the House was the subject of public discussion the shadow minister was there saying they would work with the government, they would do everything, they would help, they would expedite and all the rest of it. Despite those assertions and promises from the shadow minister, when it came on for debate what we saw from the opposition was filibuster, filibuster and filibuster.                     So I think perhaps the opposition need to talk to work out what their actual position is, having seen every position that it is possible to have during the course of this debate.                 Of course, the fact that they have had every position that it is possible to have is not limited to the procedural questions in this debate. Originally the shadow minister was there saying that, in terms of the opposition's policies and plans, it was completely irrelevant to them whether or not a country they dealt with was a refugee convention country. He was there saying that the Howard government dealt with countries -                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. My question went to the government's lack of plans and their lack of ability to stop the boats.                     I was indicating that this lack of consistency on process has been mirrored by a lack of consistency on substance. I refer to the statement of the shadow minister on 27 July 2010, talking about his plan in relation to Nauru, where he said:                 No it's not. It's not a precondition that Nauru is a signatory to the refugee convention.                 Of course, because of the politics of all of this, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister have now adopted a completely different position.                 Why are they doing that? Why have they moved from their original position to this completely different position? The reason they have moved is because they want to act in what they perceive to be their political interest, not the national interest. They want to deny this country the ability to process asylum seekers offshore. I remind the shadow minister that the government's amendment to the migration bill would enable this government and governments in the future to make appropriate choices in relation to the processing of asylum seekers, including that, should it ever occur that the shadow minister served on the government benches -                      as immigration minister, if he was of the view that Nauru was a good idea -                      he would be able to do that. But they are not prepared to vote for that: something that would give them legal authority for the thing they say is their own plan. They are not even prepared to vote for that.                 Why is that the case? Why have the opposition adopted this position? We know why. It is because they want to see more boats. They want to put out a welcome mat. They want to see more boats. The Leader of the Opposition will never be more delighted than the day on which he sees a boat arrive, because he in this debate, every step of the way, has prioritised his political interest over the national interest. It is actually sad to see the Liberal Party in this state of negativity. So I say to the shadow minister: rather than talking about the processing of this debate, maybe he should think about his policy as a matter of substance and what is in this nation's interest. It would be the first time he has ever done so.

  I thank the member for Cunningham because she certainly has a very keen interest in seeing the steel transformation plan implemented. Of course, it was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday along with the other clean energy bills and it was opposed - astonishingly - by the Liberal and National Parties. As is well known, the steel industry is facing very difficult times in this country. Global markets are struggling. The high value of the dollar has made steel exports less competitive and imports cheaper, and iron ore and coking coal prices are high. The two major companies have been losing money in their steel production and we are already seeing job losses and the closure of a blast furnace in Port Kembla because of these factors.                 This government is committed to steel manufacturing in this country. We are committed to the workers that it employs and we are committed to regions like Whyalla and Port Kembla that depend upon the steel industry. That is why the government has worked very closely with the steel industry in developing the $300 million steel transformation plan, which is supported by Bluescope, OneSteel and the unions representing the steel workforce. The plan itself is designed to support the industry and its workforce through these difficult times, to help reduce the emissions intensity of the industry, to support innovation and to support research and development, the application of new technology and investment in the industry. Importantly, the plan and the fact that it will be legislated will provide confidence to the financial institutions that help the industry invest.                 For the last six months the Leader of the Opposition has visited Australian steel towns and workplaces to emphasise his alleged commitment to the industry. He told Whyalla that he was so concerned that Whyalla would be wiped off the map, that Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town - an economic wasteland. He told steelworkers in Port Kembla, trying to terrify them, that he was concerned that they would lose their jobs to people in China and Indonesia. He told the Australian Steel Convention:                 _ steel is critical to our way of life -                      Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On direct relevance, I fail to see how this unbridled attack on the Leader of the Opposition could be relevant to the question he was asked.                     Thank you. I was asked what would happen if the steel plan were not established. There has been a lot of commentary about the difficulties confronting the steel industry, and many, including the Leader of the Opposition, have made observations about the importance of the industry, its survival and its competitiveness. After all of the statements that the Leader of the Opposition has made you would think that he was a veritable man of steel; but, in fact, he is a cream puff. When the opportunity came -                      the opposition voted against a $300 million plan to support the steel industry. It voted against the workers in the industry. It voted against the company's position in support of the plan. In addition, with the importance of this plan to investment confidence in the industry, the last thing that the industry needs is the Leader of the Opposition to be making a 'blood oath' that he will repeal the legislation. No-one believes that that will be lived up to.

  I am not sure how organisational arrangements happen in the opposition, but I presume that the whip's office keeps speakers lists and, if the Leader of the Opposition chose to view those lists, he would be able to do so. As it happens, I have one and I am able to draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to a large number of his members who have not spoken yet and have listed themselves as speaking in the debate. For example, they include the former minister for immigration, who has not spoken yet in this debate, and the man the Leader of the Opposition has identified as a future shadow minister for foreign affairs. He has not spoken yet in this debate. And so the list goes on. So I say to the opposition: if it is of the view now, as opposed to this speaking list, which is the speaking list that has been circulated - if it has completely changed its mind again on the migration legislation - then it might want to find a way of communicating that properly.                 What we have had over the last period is the opposition saying it would work with the government to expedite the bill, the opposition saying that it would deal with the bill on its own terms - not purpose-specific to the preferred plan of either side of politics but on its own terms. Then, of course, they backflipped and said, 'No, no; we want to draw out this debate and have a lot of speakers.' Now the Leader of the Opposition appears to be saying that they are backflipping again. Then, of course, they backflipped on whether the assessment of the bill should be one on the merits of the proposition and dealing with the High Court case or whether it should be used just as a political device in their campaign.                 All of this procedural carry-on by the opposition, at the end of the day, is a matter that will play out within this House, but what is much more important is the biggest thing the Leader of the Opposition has backflipped on: his slogan and promise to the Australian people at the last election that he would stop the boats. He has backflipped on his 'boat phone', acknowledging now that it was a stupid sham that would never have been put into practice, and now he is preparing to backflip again so he will be the man who ensures there is not in this country the ability to process asylum seekers offshore. So, to every Australian who ever heard the Leader of the Opposition say, 'Stop the boats', to every Australian who ever saw a piece of Liberal Party propaganda at the last election that said, 'Stop the boats', they should know that the Leader of the Opposition is about to trash that pledge to the Australian people and end the ability of this nation to process asylum seekers offshore. The Leader of the Opposition is doing that because he believes it is in his narrow political interest to see more boats.

  Can I say I am unsurprised by the Leader of the Opposition's question, coming as it does with the Leader of the Opposition showing his usual negativity. He has played politics over the last few day -                      as the government has pursued the national interest and ensured through our swift action that Qantas planes are returning to the sky today, that industrial action is at an end and that the parties will now be brought together in a conciliation - and if that conciliation is unsuccessful then an arbitration, a determination by Fair Work Australia, will occur.                     So what the government has assured by its swift action is that industrial action is over and that -                      I again make the point that the course of action the government embarked on has given us the results we wanted to see, which is an end of industrial action and Qantas planes taking back to the sky so that people can proceed on their travel plans with certainty. I have been very concerned about the circumstances of stranded passengers. As I have said publicly and am happy to repeat in this place, I view Qantas's action on Saturday as extreme. I view it as extreme because they stranded tens of thousands of people around our nation and around the world. With the industrial action now at an end, those passengers can start seeing Qantas planes flying again and be able to resume their journeys.                 During this period in which the government has been acting and attending to the national interest, of course the Leader of the Opposition has been playing his usual negative politics. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition has been seeking to make political points about section 431 of the Fair Work Act. As usual, the Leader of the Opposition grabs onto the politics but he never does any of the work that would be necessary in order to actually analyse the situation and act in the national interest. The Leader of the Opposition never bothered to turn his mind to the national interest.                 Let me, for the purpose of the parliamentary record, explain to the Leader of the Opposition the workings of section 431 of the act. This is a section of last resort. It appears in the Fair Work Act and it appeared in earlier legislation. It has never been used. A minister cannot use it until a minister is satisfied that there is a high threshold of significant damage to the national economy - the same test that Fair Work Australia directed itself to. The claims that the minister could have used this section prior to the escalation of the industrial dispute on Saturday are wholly untrue, and anybody who provided him with legal advice to the contrary would have been providing him with the wrong advice.                 The dispute escalated on Saturday. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the power under section 431 is capable of judicial review. It has never been used before. It would have taken us into wholly new legal terrain, so we determined on Saturday to use section 424 - which has been effective - to get the result we wanted, which was to get planes back into the sky. I would also note on the record for the purpose of completeness that we were advised by the relevant department that in these circumstances the appropriate section to use was section 424. The Leader of the Opposition obviously wanted to get the nation on a journey of potentially never-ending litigation. I wanted to get this dispute resolved, and I have done so.

  I thank the member for the question. I know that he and members of the government have been motivated at all times by the national interest. I will be very clear about this. On Saturday we saw an escalation of the Qantas dispute. We saw Qantas take extreme action. Qantas had alternatives. I have made it very clear to the CEO of Qantas that I do not believe this extreme action should have been taken. I do not believe that Qantas should have acted to leave tens of thousands of Australians stranded effectively without notice around Australia and in many other parts of the world. When Qantas advised the government that it was determined to take this course, that it was implementing grounding the planes at 5 pm on Saturday in preparation of a lockout of its workforce, the government concluded that this would be a course of action that could cause significant damage to the national economy and that the course the government should take is to intervene in the dispute.                  We did intervene in the dispute and now the result is there for all Australians to see. Industrial action has been terminated and Qantas flights, during the course of this afternoon, will start returning to our skies. With Qantas flights returning to our skies from this afternoon, Qantas will commence working as normal over the next few days, its employees will commence working as normal, and that normal work pattern will continue. Industrial action has been terminated. The industrial parties now have an opportunity to sort the dispute out and, if they do not sort the dispute out, then at the end of 21 days Fair Work Australia can impose an outcome on them.                 Throughout all of this, the priority of the government has been the circumstances of Australians who have been stranded in many parts of the country and overseas who have had to face up to that inconvenience. Of course we did take steps to ensure that we were providing consular assistance to those Australians who were stranded overseas. Our focus has also been on the national economy and the fact that industrial action has now been terminated is not just a win for passengers who were stranded, who will now see Qantas flights taking to the skies, it is a win for the one million Australians who work in the tourism industry. We were particularly concerned about their circumstances with the action by Qantas on the weekend.                 The government, on Saturday afternoon, determined to intervene in this dispute because it was in the national interest to do so. Our swift intervention has ensured that industrial action is at an end. Our swift intervention has ensured that employees are back at work and that Qantas flights are starting to take to the sky. We have been motivated every step of the way by the interests of the national economy and by the circumstances of stranded passengers. It is a pity that the opposition is only motivated by the playing of cheap politics and the making of incorrect claims.

  I can only assume from the nature of this questioning that the opposition have got up this morning and read the newspapers but they have not done anything else, because they appear to be referring to an incorrect report in today's newspapers that Alan Joyce himself has today corrected on the public record. Alan Joyce has verified today that he was not seeking to speak to me on Saturday afternoon, that he contacted the government for the purpose of advising the government of the decision of the Qantas board to ground flights at five o'clock. That is the circumstance here - as much as the game playing from the opposition continues.                     They are all feisty in pursuit of Work Choices again. Let me make it very clear what happened on Saturday afternoon and very directly answer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question. Given her noted advocacy of Work Choices, I will make sure I do answer it. On Saturday afternoon, the government was advised by Qantas that it had determined to ground the planes. The advice from Qantas was crystal clear that they had made the determination to do so. They were not consulting with the government; they were not asking the government to do anything. They were grounding the planes at five o'clock - no ifs, no buts, no maybes; they were grounding the planes. In the face of that declaration by Qantas that they were grounding the planes, the government acted. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition would have spent days and days and days in talks as people were stranded around the country. I preferred to act. I did act and, as a result, industrial action is at an end.                  On the question of telephone calls to the industrial parties, I have today spoken to a number of the industrial parties and I have made it perfectly clear to them, including Alan Joyce -                       and including Tony Sheldon - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - that my expectation and the expectation of the government, having successfully acted to end the industrial action and get Qantas planes back in the sky, is that the industrial parties now get around a table and get this dispute fixed. I say to those industrial parties, as I have said to them in those telephone calls and as I said not long before coming to question time at a media conference, I believe the obligation now rests equally on each of their shoulders to get around a table and get this dispute sorted. My predisposition when faced with the circumstances I saw on Saturday was to get it fixed and I have.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. The government's priority has absolutely been to get Qantas back in the air, and overnight we have achieved just that. Upon receiving notification from Qantas after 2pm on Saturday, this government acted. Firstly, we engaged with CASA. Given the safety issues that had been raised by Qantas, we confirmed with CASA that there were no grounds as far as they were concerned for the grounding of the airline at five o'clock that afternoon. There were no grounds whatsoever from the air safety regulator for the action that Qantas unilaterally took at their board meeting on Saturday morning. Unlike the Patrick dispute - where you had a collaboration and a conspiracy with the government, with people being trained in Dubai - this was a unilateral action by an employer to lock out its workforce on Monday at 8pm, in spite of the fact that the only industrial action which was pending was pilots wearing red ties and making announcements to passengers on aircraft. We confirmed that that was the case. We applied for an urgent hearing before Fair Work Australia. I had a discussion with the Prime Minister and we had discussions between ministers.                  After 5pm, after the announcement by Mr Joyce, I spoke with the CEO of Virgin Australia, John Borghetti, who indicated he would assist. Indeed, Virgin Australia provided 3,000 extra passenger seats between the announcement by Qantas and the close of business on Saturday, an extra 3,500 seats yesterday and an additional 3,000 seats today. I thank Virgin Australia for coming to the party in aid of stranded Australians. We also established a task force in my department to work with the industry and other government departments to facilitate the movement of stranded passengers and to work through the safety and regulatory issues that were required. Following the decision by Fair Work Australia, the parties must now get on with making a deal, and Qantas planes need to get into the air. I can inform the House that CASA received the Qantas safety paperwork at 10.23 this morning. A CASA safety team is currently reviewing this material, assessing serviceability and sequencing of returning aircraft. CASA have allowed Qantas to conduct positioning flights - that is, flights without passengers moving to their points of departure - once RPTs can be resumed.                  Qantas has today publicly advised that maintenance staff have worked well to clear the backlog of work and to ensure that the Qantas fleet is ready for operation as soon as possible. CASA have advised my department that at this stage it appears that flights could be up as early as 3 pm this afternoon. Given the large numbers affected, Sydney to Melbourne is the priority. International flights are expected to resume from London this evening, and my department and CASA estimate that Qantas will be at full operation on Wednesday. Safety will remain the priority for the government in getting Qantas back into the air.

  What we see in that question is absolutely typical of the Leader of the Opposition. He comes in here and makes allegations based on no facts, because he is always interested in playing politics. I would make this observation: the happiest people in this nation when Fair Work Australia made its decision overnight were the travelling public who were stranded. The unhappiest people in this nation were the opposition, because it was going to wreck their strategy to play negative politics today. To the Leader of the Opposition I say: what a ridiculous question. As he well knows, from every public statement by Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas, Qantas had made a determination to ground planes at 5 pm.                     Being very directly relevant to the question, the Leader of the Opposition is creating a misrepresentation in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to pretend that the facts of this matter were that somehow a telephone call would have changed Qantas's determination to ground the fleet on Saturday. In asserting that, he is flying directly in the face of everything that Qantas has said about the reasons that it acted on Saturday and its grounding of the fleet. So who he is insulting by this conduct is actually not me. He is insulting the people at Qantas who were putting forward their argument in the public domain about why they acted. The people he is verballing are people like Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas. But, of course, treating people decently and respectfully is never high on the Leader of the Opposition's menu. The attitude that the Leader of the Opposition is taking today is to deliberately to create a falsehood in order to pursue his political negativity.                 What the Leader of the Opposition actually cannot stand about all of this is that the fair work system did what it needed to do to get industrial action terminated. He cannot stand that. The reason he cannot stand that is that he hoped that this Qantas dispute would add to his political campaign to sow doubts about the fair work system, to soften the ground for Work Choices. That is what he is on about. I did speak to the industrial parties today. I acted on Saturday to get the industrial action terminated. It was terminated this morning. Following its termination, I spoke to the industrial parties to tell them to get around a table in this 21-day period, to do it early and to get this dispute fixed. To the Leader of the Opposition, who is now in here with his carry-on: I really do wonder where he was for all of the years of the Howard government. I remind him of someone called Peter Reith -                      No, I don't think he did vote for him, as it happens. Maybe he is trying to forget who Peter Reith is. He certainly forgot to vote for him. The traditional disposition of the Liberal Party on these questions is against intervention in industrial disputes, and Peter Reith has made that absolutely clear. Indeed, in their days in office, the only time they intervened in industrial disputes with enthusiasm was when it was accompanied by dogs and balaclavas on the waterfront. We stand for fair work and a fair work system which is working. They stand for ripping off working people, and Mr Work Choices is shouting out his enthusiasm for doing that all over again.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. I say to the member for Melbourne in this parliament, as I have said outside this parliament, it is not my intention to offer running commentary about the issues in dispute between Qantas, trade unions and employees whilst the conciliation process is happening. I do not think that would be the appropriate thing to do and I do not intend to do it.                  The circumstance of the dispute now is that the government has acted to get industrial action out of the way, and now we are in the conciliation period. Qantas and the trade unions involved should use this conciliation period to get the issues in dispute resolved. I do understand from the point of view of the trade unions that there is a job security issue that they are seeking to pursue; the right way of pursuing that now is in the conciliation with Qantas. I say again: if the conciliation with Qantas does not end in an agreement, then the industrial umpire Fair Work Australia can at the end of a 21-day period impose a determination on the parties.                  I note that in his question the member for Melbourne used the term 'may' in relation to whether or not the issues about which he is concerned end up featuring in that determination, if Fair Work Australia ends up making one. That will be a question for Fair Work Australia - to deal with those issues if conciliation fails.                  But I believe it is in the national interest, in the interests of Qantas and in the interests of the employees of Qantas to use this opportunity now - with industrial action not occurring - to get around a table and get this resolved. I remind the House that the termination of industrial action is the termination of all industrial action, whether it be taken by unions or whether it be taken by Qantas by way of lockout. So the opportunity is now there for the parties to get this resolved for the long term, and they should use it.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. As members are aware, on Saturday afternoon Qantas took the extraordinary action of grounding its entire international and domestic fleet. This action posed very significant risk to our economy, to employment and to the business community more generally, and that is why the Prime Minister took immediate and decisive action to get Fair Work Australia involved. The consequence of that is that planes are going to be back in the air. We understand the seriousness of the situation, even if those opposite do not. They might think they can play a political game with this, but these matters are too serious for the politicking of those opposite. We took our responsibilities extremely seriously. I want to explain to the House why we took our responsibilities so seriously.                 In August Qantas carried a massive 1.5 million domestic passengers; that is something like 50,000 passengers a day. In the same month it carried half a million international passengers. So this decision of Qantas to lock out its workforce - without notice - posed a very significant risk to our national economy. The decision by Fair Work Australia was a significant breakthrough in resolving this difficult dispute, because what we would have seen if this were a protracted dispute is knock-on effects right through our economy.                  I am a Queenslander; I understand the importance of aviation to the tourist industry. But it is not just the tourist industry. We understand the importance of aviation when it comes to our mining industry - for example, fly-in fly-out miners. All of these are immediately affected - and that is before you go to the tens of thousands of businesses in the tourist industry and elsewhere - everybody, right down the supply chain, who would have been affected if this dispute had gone on. So the Prime Minister acted decisively and acted immediately to deal with this dispute.                  But what we are hearing in the House today is the game playing and the politicking of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition is all opposition and no leadership. He would rather see the country fail than the government succeed. But, when you get to a difficult national issue like this, you have to put the national interest first, and this government will always put the national interest first. We did it during the global recession and the global financial crisis, despite the opposition of all of those opposite who did not want to see us stimulate the economy. This side of the House will always put jobs first. We will always try to do everything we can to keep the doors of small business open, because we are committed to the national interest. They are just committed to their own selfish political interests.

  The most important thing you must do when you are handling an industrial dispute is put the national interest first, and that is what this government has done. When the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport was informed of their decision, which they said was non-negotiable, he rang me - he rang the Treasurer - and I then spoke to him. I subsequently spoke to the Prime Minister and to a number of other ministers to bring them together and to put in place the swiftest possible action that we could, given the threat to our national economy. So we acted as soon as we possibly could, we acted within the law of the land and we acted with a genuine desire to resolve this dispute.                 I know that those opposite want to take sides in a dispute. We know that they always take one side when they are talking about industrial relations, and we know they never take the side of the workers. But what we will do on this side of the House is work in an even-handed way within the industrial relations system to make sure that both the employers and the employees are heard, and we will do that in the national interest.

  I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. I know that he is a long-time campaigner for fairness in the industrial relations system. When we came to government, we reintroduced fairness through the Fair Work Act. I am asked how this played a role in the resolution of this dispute. It played an important role, but it was the act facilitated by the decisive action of the Prime Minister that got the planes flying again.                 This was a situation in which Australia was confronted with a company that, with very little notice and no intention of changing its mind, had determined to ground its entire fleet domestically and internationally, which would have led to the crippling of the Australian economy and the stranding of tens of thousands of passengers around the world. What the government did was take immediate action when it learned of this intention. It took this matter to Fair Work Australia. The matter was convened that night and adjourned the next day so that the case for the impact in terms of the national interest and the economy could be determined. As a result of that adjourned hearing, the industrial action was terminated - not just suspended but terminated. That has now allowed the circumstances in which, over the next three weeks, the parties are required to bargain in good faith to resolve this dispute, and, if that cannot be done, it will be compulsorily arbitrated upon. That is what will happen because of the act and because of the actions by the Prime Minister.                     I am asked, and I hear all of this from the other side, about what the government should have done and when; let us just reflect on their view of what the government's role in similar circumstances would be. This is what the Leader of the Opposition on a previous occasion has said in relation to government involvement in industrial disputes:                 The Government must be highly selective about the cases where it seeks to intervene. In general, the parties to an industrial dispute should make their own arrangements _ without any government -                  assistance. In other words, these hypocrites who sit opposite are trying to make the issue of how we should have got involved when we did, yet they themselves do not believe in government involvement. If there is any doubt about that, I remind people what the architect of Work Choices had to say a week ago. This is what Peter Reith had to say:                 A lot of people say there's a dispute so let's get the government to fix it. Quite frankly that is old thinking _ It's an idea that we -                  meaning the Liberal Party -                    abandoned for a very good reason _ when it comes to a dispute the government is not the solution _                  That is the thinking of those on the other side. So do not come here, with your cant and hypocrisy, saying where the government should have intervened earlier; look at your own form. If you want to understand where this dispute could have ended up, look no further than what happened in the Patrick dispute, where, rather than try to get a resolution, you fanned its continuation. You had a midnight cabinet meeting to pass legislation that legitimised the sacking of an entire workforce and its replacement by a scab workforce. That is your view of industrial relations; it is not ours.

  I thank the honourable member for his maiden question on aviation in 4Â½ years - I thank him sincerely. If the shadow minister had access to Sky, he would know that I have indicated very clearly that this morning, after Mr Joyce gave an interview with Fran Kelly, I rang Mr Joyce and informed him that I would be making public the fact that on no occasion had Qantas ever raised the issue of a lockout of its workforce -                      Mr Joyce will confirm that on no occasion did Qantas ever raise the issue of a lockout of its workforce -                      if you listen - to me or any other government minister.                     I am being directly relevant, Mr Speaker. On Saturday afternoon I received a phone call from a staff member who had been contacted by a staff member of Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas. He indicated to me that Mr Joyce would be making a phone call to me to advise me of the situation.                  I rang Mr Joyce back when I did not hear from him at 1.51 pm. I still did not hear from him. I rang at 1.55 pm. I still did not hear from him. I rang at 1.58 pm seeking to ascertain what the information was. Mr Joyce rang me -                      Mr Joyce -                      Mr Joyce rang me after 2 pm on Saturday afternoon. He informed me that according to him the board had made a decision on Saturday morning that they would lock out their workforce at 8 pm on Monday evening and that they would ground the fleet due to safety concerns at five o'clock that afternoon.                 The fact is that, in terms of Mr Joyce's position during that conversation, he indicated very, very clearly that the grounding of the aircraft was as a result of the air operator certificate advice to him that the lockout from this evening at 8 pm would result in safety concerns according to Qantas. Indeed Mr Joyce indicated that that was the case. Mr Joyce had indicated in a number of meetings I had with him that planes had been grounded, and that is public knowledge: seven planes had been grounded.                  On 18 October, Qantas released a press release saying:                 If this overtime ban continues, we will be grounding even more aircraft.                 They did that publicly, but the fact is that the licensed engineers union lifted the overtime ban and all industrial action for three weeks, and the only action that was taking place was pilots wearing red ties.

  I would like to thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She, like every member of the government, is animated by the national interest, and of course the way in which the government approached the Qantas lockout of its workforce reflects the commitment of the government to ensure the national interest of people and the economy is upheld.                 On Saturday afternoon, mid-afternoon, the government was notified by Qantas that they would lock out their workforce from 8 am Monday morning - that is, baggage crew, ramp crew, caterers, licensed engineers, international pilots and short-haul pilots; however, they said that, because they were going to lock their workforce out from 8 am Monday morning, all planes would have to be grounded from 5 pm on Saturday. All planes in the air would be allowed to finish that leg and thereafter 155 planes would be grounded, not by the unions but by the management of Qantas, and 140,000 passengers around the world and throughout Australia, because of industrial action by one of the parties in a negotiation, were forced to have their plans inconvenienced, business trips inconvenienced, the tourism industry of one million people inconvenienced, families wanting to be reunited visiting sick relatives inconvenienced. What the government did was take appropriate steps under section 424 of the Fair Work Act to immediately make an application to terminate the industrial action and, in the alternative, if the tribunal did not find favour with that application, suspend the industrial action. All through the evening of Saturday night, senior representatives of the department of transport and the department of tourism attended these hearings and the evidence went -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. There was evidence given by the secretaries of two Commonwealth departments about the impact upon the economy by Qantas's action. Then, for 12 hours on Sunday, evidence was led as to why the industrial action by all parties, principally triggered by Qantas's action, should be terminated.                 Assisting the government by attending those 12 hours of hearings on Sunday, I can report to the House that I did not trip over any members of the Liberal Party trying to fix this dispute. They were happy to churn out the press releases.                     In fact, if any member of the opposition had bothered to turn up, they would have realised that, when Qantas was supporting the government's application to terminate the bargaining periods and cease the industrial action, at no point did Qantas allege that, if they had just had a chance to speak to the government before 5 pm, none of this would happen. Qantas never put that on the record in the 12 hours of legal hearings.                 Furthermore, at no stage did Qantas make an alternative application and say that the government should be pursuing another section of the act. In fact, it was very clear that the independent umpire, the Fair Work tribunal, acted decisively and made its decision. Thank goodness this government put in place this act to provide for a tribunal that would stand up to resolve the industrial action.                 Let the record be clear: if Qantas and Alan Joyce had not taken the industrial action against the workforce, these planes would not have been grounded and there would have been no upheaval to the Australian economy.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Indeed, I had a number of meetings with Mr Joyce. As I indicated at the press conference, I would not normally make these public, but, given they appeared in the Daily Telegraph on page 3, I think I am entitled to do so. I met with Mr Joyce firstly on 11 October, with staff. I then met with Mr Joyce on the Friday before last, 21 October, along with Mr Sheldon, in my Marrickville office. I have a good relationship with both Mr Joyce and Mr Sheldon. I offered to facilitate discussions between the parties in order to resolve these issues. As a result of that discussion, Mr Sheldon, on behalf of the TWU, called off the industrial action which was proposed for the following Wednesday, because real progress was made.                 That afternoon, I had another meeting with Mr Joyce in my Marrickville office. The following Wednesday, I had another meeting with Mr Joyce and Mr Sheldon in my Marrickville office. Again, last Wednesday progress was being made towards a resolution of the dispute.                     I had those meetings as well as numerous text messages and phone conversations - indeed, I have probably had more conversations with Mr Joyce in the last fortnight that I had with my family, because we were determined to get a resolution to this dispute.                 At no stage did Mr Joyce do either of two things. At no stage did Mr Joyce publicly or privately ask the government for any intervention into this dispute. That is the first thing. The second thing is: at no stage did Mr Joyce indicate that the grounding of the Qantas fleet was imminent and that it was under active consideration. Indeed, on Saturday, throughout 12 hours of hearings before Fair Work Australia, Qantas indicated very clearly that the grounding of the fleet was because of the lockout of the workers at 8 pm on Monday evening. You do not have to trust us on that; you have to look at the transcript of Fair Work Australia from 10 pm to 2 am on Saturday evening into Sunday morning and from 2 pm yesterday afternoon through to 2 am this morning. Throughout that entire time Qantas have said they relied upon their safety concerns due to the grounding of the fleet. That is why they grounded the fleet at 5 pm. Indeed, Mr Joyce in the conversation with me raised specifically safety concerns. I indicated in the question I got from our side of the House earlier today that I sought advice from CASA on Saturday afternoon, after being advised by Mr Joyce, about whether there was any justification for the grounding of the fleet and I was told there was none.

  I thank the member for Page for the question because it goes to my prime concern with respect to the action of Qantas last Saturday - that is, finally giving the tourism industry some certainty to actually get on with the job. On receiving the phone call, the government took the natural course that it should take: act decisively and terminate all industrial action because, as of Saturday, the parties had in essence given up the ghost. They had effectively said to the government that they were incapable of resolving this issue. The commission has now very decisively said that it has terminated all industrial action and the parties are now to seek to negotiate these issues in good faith. But from tourism's perspective it is about time we had a certain degree of certainty. How much pressure can this industry bear? Just think about the challenges that it has confronted over the last 12 months. Think about the Japanese market and the impact of Fukushima. Think about Cyclone Yasi and the natural disasters, like the floods earlier this year, and the associated impact on the tourism market in New Zealand of the earthquakes that have damaged visitation to Australia from New Zealand.                 The tourism sector is centrally important to the Australian economy. It employs directly and indirectly just under one million Australians. Qantas is our most important carrier, both domestically and internationally. By way of reference, Qantas's international share is almost 18 per cent of total flights and provides approximately half the domestic air travel services in Australia. That is not only important to international visitation and, I might say, domestic tourism; it is also centrally important to me as the Minister for Resources and Energy. It is reflected in why we are spending the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax on fixing the airport roads in Perth - the most important piece of infrastructure not only to the tourism industry in Western Australia but also to the resources sector when you think about the importance of fly-in fly-out workers. The Australian workforce is becoming more and more mobile in terms of suiting the needs of us delivering that huge investment pipeline of $430 billion, of which $140 billion is in the LNG sector, which is currently propping up the Australian economy. Asia presents us with an opportunity, not only from a resources perspective; I might also say that Asia is our new frontier from a tourism perspective with growth of 10 per cent per year - a capacity to actually double our numbers by 2020.                 I simply say as the CEO of Tourism Australia, Mr McEvoy, appropriately said in a media release issued today: 'This decision finally provides certainty for tourism operators in Australia. It says that, both domestically and internationally, Australian tourism is open for business. We now have certainty, a capacity for people overseas and from within Australia to actually start planning their Australian holidays for this forthcoming summer.' I simply say to the industrial commission: you were right to adopt the recommendation of the Prime Minister to act decisively and to cease all industrial action so we have some certainty for all those small and medium sized businesses to prop up the tourism sector in Australia.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question because it enables me to explain something about section 431 that throughout the course of question time has been ignored by the opposition as they twist and turn the facts to try and seek their very silly political story. Let me explain to the Leader of the National Party about section 431. I think he and the opposition need to understand this so that they stop misrepresenting the situation to Australians. I have been asked a question about section 431 and I am answering it.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I know the facts stand in the way of the opposition but they are going to hear the facts. Section 431 is the section of the Fair Work Act that enables a minister to make a declaration about industrial action. The opposition have pretended all of this question time, and they have pretended in the public debate, that the way in which that section works is that a minister just gets out a sheet of paper and scrawls on it 'I declare' and then it is done. In creating that impression in here and in the public debate, the opposition are peddling a falsehood. The peddling of that falsehood should stop here and it should stop now. It is not the right thing to do - in circumstances where the national interest is engaged, where tens of thousands of Australians have been stranded and where Australians have been anxious about the circumstances of the national economy - for the opposition to peddle that falsehood. Section 431 does not enable a minister to get out a piece of paper, scribble 'I declare' on it and sign it. That is not how it works. The minister needs to be satisfied of certain facts in order to make the declaration; the minister needs to inform himself or herself.                     I know the facts are not helping the opposition, but screaming does not change the facts. So let us listen to the facts for the first time. Section 431 does not enable a minister to just get out a sheet of paper; the minister would have to have the evidence before them that would enable them to come to the conclusion about the national economy. In terms of advice and the extension of procedural fairness, the obligation may extend to hearing from the parties affected, and when the declaration is made it is subject to judicial review. So if the minister makes a declaration - bearing in mind that this has never been done in Australia before - it would very likely end up before a court, and a court would be able to traverse all of the facts and all of the circumstances.                 If the government had taken that course, it would have been a step into a legal unknown in the sense that this section had never been tested before, and inevitably, given the circumstances of this dispute, it would have ended up in a court case. So rather than putting the nation in the grip of that legal uncertainty for week after week and month after month - which the Leader of the Opposition is clearly recommending - we used the section of the act that has resulted in industrial action being terminated and planes getting back into the sky this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to peddle this falsehood because he is desperately unhappy that the Fair Work system has worked to terminate this industrial action. He is always barracking for his political interest rather than the national interest. The performance of the opposition today has been truly shoddy indeed.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He knows that we on this side of the House believe there is a need for a balanced approach in industrial relations between employers and employees. There is one thing that is very clear though, which is that we are on the side of the travelling public. That is why we intervened in this dispute on Saturday.                     There were 68,000 Qantas passengers affected by this unilateral and extreme decision by Qantas management on Saturday. Those opposite, in their questions and interjections, imply that people somehow should have known that Qantas was about to ground every single plane domestically and internationally. Did they say that that was a prospect at any time? Is there a single commentator, aviation writer, opinion writer, journalist or businessperson in the nation who thought that Qantas would take the step of grounding every single plane in their fleet in Australia and internationally, with the consequences for their brand?                 When unions stepped out of line - like when the secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association said 'Don't fly Qantas' - I was critical of them, and the Minister for Tourism was critical of them.                     Something you will never hear from those on the other side of the House is a balanced approach. So when the employers, through a lockout of the workforce, grounded the airline, we were also critical of them, as you would expect. For those who suggest that somehow the government should have known that this was going to occur, I refer you to the comments of the Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, himself. In his press conference at 5 pm he described this decision as unbelievable. He stated, 'We're making the unbelievable decision to ground our airline.' Indeed, it was quite an extraordinary decision, of which no-one received fair notice - not its customers, not its employees, not the government. The government was first informed of a statement by the CEO of Qantas at 2 pm on Saturday afternoon. The government acted. I was on my feet with a comprehensive government response 15 minutes after Alan Joyce finished his press conference. Indeed, the CEO of Qantas indicated to the Minister for Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, that were this information to become public he would bring it forward and ground the airline immediately, as Senator Evans indicated at the press conference earlier today. The fact is that this is a vital industry, and that is why the government took action. Those opposite say the government should have prevented this, but Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas, does not argue that that is the case.

  I am very happy to answer the question because it once again goes to the fiction and falsehood that the opposition are pursuing here. It is truly a disgraceful course of conduct when we are dealing with issues in the national interest. I say again to the opposition: when they are not in this negative mode - if they ever get into anything other than this negative mode - perhaps when they go back to their offices and sit down quietly and perhaps when the Work Choices fever ekes out of their veins, they should get out the Fair Work Act and start looking at some industrial law and they should think about it.                 This is the declaration a minister makes when the minister needs to have evidence that he or she is acting legally appropriately - that is, that the test has been met about significant damage to the national economy. The minister does not just have a little think to themselves; they need to have the evidence. They also need to make sure that every step that they take can withstand judicial review, because this can be judicially reviewable. Ministerial declarations can be judicially reviewable.                  Let us be very clear about the course the Leader of the Opposition would have had this nation on. Let us go through all the ridiculous hypocrisy we have heard today. We have got the Liberal Party now talking up the role of the industrial umpire. They spent a decade trying to kill it. Now they are talking up the role of the industrial umpire. They cannot wait to run in front of the industrial umpire after a decade of trying to kill it. We have got the Liberal Party talking up the role of arbitration when they spent more than a decade pursuing the case that arbitration was killing the Australian economy and we needed to be in a world of enterprise bargaining - the Liberal Party talking up arbitration after they brought us Work Choices, clearly calculated to end the safety net, to limit arbitration, to not enable fair bargaining and to kill the industrial umpire. That is what the Liberal Party did.                 Against that backdrop of Work Choices, they get out the Fair Work Act, they go, 'Oh, I'll have a look at it, a bit of a newspaper and a bit of a think' - and now I am an industrial relations lawyer apparently - and then they peddle this falsehood that a minister can just scrawl a declaration on a piece of paper. It would have been judicially reviewed. That is what would have happened. There would have been months potentially of legal uncertainty. This section had never been used before.                 The Leader of the Opposition is now saying to me, 'Why did you put it in your act?' It was in predecessor acts. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition wants to get Peter Reith on the phone and ask him that question - another question coming from the Leader of the Opposition's direct ignorance about workplace relations law because he does not care about jobs and he does not care about fairness at work. He has never bothered to learn anything about it.                 The Leader of the Opposition, in suggesting that this was the better course for the government on Saturday, is peddling a falsehood. The government went down the course that had greater legal certainty, that would get the result that we needed, that is, that planes were back in the sky and - guess what - they are. That is what we did. We succeeded in getting planes back in the sky. The Leader of the Opposition would have had this nation on a course where -                      The interjection shows the falsehood. The test is not what I needed; it is what would have survived a subsequent judicial review. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to have this nation on a course of months of uncertainty. We wanted to fix this problem and we did. We know that that has hurt you - that people are getting back on planes - because that is how negative you are.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and make the point that we on this side believe it is absolutely crucial that there be fairness in the workplace. That is why we legislated Fair Work Australia. The reason we had to legislate Fair Work Australia is that the Howard government had stripped away the bases of any fairness in the industrial relations system. First of all, they had moved to a situation that effectively denied collective bargaining, trying to move everyone onto individual contracts, which we know were unfair. I have quoted in this House before the numbers of times and the percentages of cuts to conditions that happened under individual contracts versus collective bargaining.                  There was also no requirement under the previous legislation for the employer to bargain in good faith. There were many examples where the employer simply refused to bargain. We have one example of a lockout - effectively a strike - but the place closed down for 13 weeks because the employer simply was not required to bargain in good faith. The third element of an industrial relations system is an important role for the independent umpire if the dispute cannot be resolved through bargaining in good faith. That is the position we find ourselves in now with the Qantas dispute. Clearly the employer, Qantas, had taken the view that they could not negotiate any further. But, rather than seek to get another crack at it, they took the extreme case of announcing that they were going to sack the whole workforce on Monday but grounding the airline in the first instance. The member for North Sydney talked before about employers who had come out and spoken about the risk to the integrity of industrial relations system in this country due to militant unionism. This dispute was not caused by the unions; it was caused by the decision of Qantas to ground its entire fleet. Where is the fairness in the assessment?                  We have always understood the importance of getting the parties to bargain - to resolve the dispute, to settle their differences - but we have also understood that if the parties cannot do that then it may need to go to the independent arbitrator, through conciliation and ultimately through arbitration. That system potentially existed in the legislation that they had, but those opposite never would have practised it because their view was that it was in their political interests to keep a dispute going that was about cutting people's wages or conditions or tilting the balance back the other way.                 We saw it with the Patrick dispute. We saw it when they allowed the introduction of people with Rottweilers and balaclavas to come in and sack a work force at midnight. That is the sort of industrial relations system the other side supports. We, for our part, believe in fairness and we will practise it using a legislative framework. This government is prepared to act in the national interest and that is just what we have done. We have the airline back in the air.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I must admit I did commence laughing at the start of it, because I thought the Leader of the Opposition was moving off Qantas! And I would have known why if he was moving off Qantas today - because, having spent all of that time yesterday yelling and screaming for answers about who knew what when, what happens today? The Leader of the Opposition twice refused to answer a question about when he knew that Qantas was going to lock its workers out and ground the planes -                      When did the Leader of the Opposition know?                     When did he know that tens of thousands of passengers were going to be stranded? When did he know the workers were going to be locked out?                     I am very happy to answer the Leader of the Opposition's question because I think all the facts, every fact, about this dispute should be before the Australian people - every fact about contact with Qantas, every fact about who knew what when. The Leader of the Opposition might like to apply to himself the same standard that he is always so eager to apply to others - in here yesterday, screaming at the top of his voice for answers and, today, a man stunned into a humbling silence. To the Leader of the Opposition, I say this: what the government did on Saturday was the appropriate conduct -                    The member for Cook then left the chamber.                     for a government that understands that the workplace relations system is about balance. It is about treating the interests of employers and employees in balance. It is about making sure that there is fairness for all. It is about making sure that there is not industrial disruption that threatens the national interest. That is the approach of the government and that is the approach we took. Consequently, we moved on Saturday afternoon to bring this dispute to an end, and it was at an end by yesterday afternoon, with planes back in the sky - a balanced approach to the interests of employers and employees, always guided by what is in the interests of the national economy and the travelling public.                 But what has amazed me in the course of the last few days is that in these circumstances - with Qantas having decided on Saturday to dramatically escalate this dispute, to engage in a lockout of its workforce, to ground planes with no appropriate notice to the travelling public so that tens of thousands of people were stranded away from home, unable to get to work, unable to get back to their loved ones - the Leader of the Opposition has not uttered one word of criticism of Qantas, not one word of criticism of Qantas after it stranded tens of thousands of passengers. We know why that is - well, we only know part of why that is - because the opposition leader's attitude towards industrial relations is to give the employers everything they want every time and smash into the workers. That was what Work Choices was about. What we do not quite know is all of the details about the Leader of the Opposition's interactions with Qantas, because he is now engaged in a cover-up of that. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time he came clean with the Australian public. The tens of thousands of members of the Australian public who were stranded would be interested to know what the Leader of the Opposition knew and when he knew it.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I know that he has always been interested in making sure that there are appropriate industrial rules so that both employers and employees can work together in balanced, harmonious and productive workplaces. That has always been the attitude of the Labor Party: to make sure that employers, employees and trade unions can work together in the interests of productivity and the national economy.                     I am asked by the member for Banks about the Qantas dispute, and to the member for Banks I would say that in the early hours of Monday morning Fair Work Australia, the industrial umpire which we empowered under the Fair Work Act, made the appropriate order to end the damaging disputation in Qantas, particularly the grounding of its fleet, caused by the decision of Qantas on Saturday. It was an extreme decision to lock out their workers and to ground their fleet, stranding tens of thousands of Australians in places away from home and around the world without sufficient notice to make alternative arrangements.                 Fair Work Australia did what it should do under the Fair Work Act to end that disputation. We are a nation which, in the past, has seen lockouts of employees persist for months but Fair Work Australia, seized of the matter during Saturday as a result of the government's application to Fair Work Australia, immediately commenced to work and planes were back in the sky on Monday afternoon as a result of the government's application and the decision of Fair Work Australia.                 I am aware that during the last few days there has been criticism of the Fair Work Act and commentary about its provisions. To those who raise that criticism I say that if people want to have a debate on workplace relations in this parliament, bring it on. Bring it on, because we do know that the opposition wants to change the Fair Work Act and go back to Work Choices. If that is the debate of the day then bring it on. Let me make it clear where we will stand in that debate and what principles will guide us, because you have seen it on display during the Qantas dispute.                 We will always act in the interests of the Australian public, as we acted in the interests of the travelling public during the Qantas dispute. We will always act in the interests of the national economy because there is nothing more important to this country than the prosperity and opportunity that a strong national economy can provide. We will always act with balance and fairness to the rights of working people, to make sure that they can be appropriately represented at work. That is why we have put the safety net back after the Liberal Party took it away, that is why we have an industrial umpire with powers to act and that is why we have a fair bargaining system.                 I do note that there are others in this debate who are bringing a different set of values, most particularly, the Leader of the Opposition, who has not uttered one word of criticism of Qantas for taking this industrial action - not one word.                     Can you imagine what the Leader of the Opposition would have said if working people had marched away from work and had caused the grounding of flights around the nation? If it had been employees who had done that, imagine what the Leader of the Opposition would have said. But there was not one word of criticism of Qantas - not one word - because the Liberal Party are bringing to this their traditional bias against working people. It has been on display over the last 48 hours, just like it was on display during the days of Work Choices.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say, gee, it is getting a bit embarrassing for you now, isn't it? There he is, with his chants of negativity. He comes in here every day and he has clipped together his little negative slogans. He has done that with a sense of desperation today because he is in cover-up mode. He does not want to be asked when he knew what he knew about Qantas. Did he know an hour before the planes were grounded? Did he know 24 hours before the planes were grounded? Did he know 48 hours before the planes were grounded? Did he ring up Qantas and suggest the planes should be grounded? Who knows what role the Leader of the Opposition played in this dispute, because he is in cover-up mode, having screamed for the truth yesterday? He wanted to know every word, every telephone call, every piece of legal advice and what was said to every minister in every meeting. He screamed for the truth. He yelled for the truth. He wanted the truth. Then, confronted with questions about his role today, he was stunningly silent. So, in the midst of that stunning silence, he has obviously gone to the 'break glass in case of emergency', and he has gone and got all of his old negative slogans out and knitted them together as a question. It is truly pathetic.                 Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: this government will continue to do the following things. We will continue to have the Fair Work system; the Leader of the Opposition believes in Work Choices. We will continue to ensure that there is a strong national economy that works in the interests of all; the Leader of the Opposition wants the miners to pay less tax - he wants to take money off other people and make the miners pay less tax. We will ensure that Australians have the benefit of new technology, the National Broadband Network; the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip it out of the ground. We will ensure that Australians have a clean energy future at the lowest possible price; just as the Leader of the Opposition wants to give money to big miners, he wants to take money off Australian families and give it to big polluters. We will ensure that we continue to reform and invest in our education system; the Leader of the Opposition is committed to ripping money out of schools and apprenticeships. We will continue to ensure that we invest in the future of Australian health; the Leader of the Opposition is a man whose only achievement as health minister in this nation was taking a billion dollars out of hospitals. We will continue to ensure that working people in this country can see an economy that is being managed in their interests and that they are receiving the services that families need; the Leader of the Opposition would never manage the economy in their interests - we can tell that from his conduct over the last few days, and certainly he is dedicated to ripping away the services that they need. We will ensure that the budget comes to surplus next year; the Leader of the Opposition sits there with his $70 billion black hole, slashing services to working families.                 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It was an attempt at distraction, but the question still remains for the Leader of the Opposition to answer: when did he first know Qantas was grounding its fleet, and why didn't he answer the questions about it at his press conference? Why not? There is no point yelling about it now. Go out and tell the truth.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and indeed it is a very good question. I have been very transparent about what the government knew and precisely when. I have indicated very clearly the process whereby my office was contacted by Mr Joyce prior to 2 pm, whereby I made three phone calls attempting to get on to Mr Joyce. Eventually Mr Joyce returned my call after 2 pm, at which point he informed me that he intended to lock out his workforce from 8 pm on Monday evening and that, as a consequence, he would shut down the airline domestically and internationally at 5 pm that day. I have indicated very clearly that that was the first time that Mr Joyce or anyone else from Qantas had ever raised with me the prospect of a lockout of the workforce and a consequential shutdown of the airline. There are some on the opposite side who have suggested that somehow I should have known that would have occurred. There was not a single person in Australia, in Qantas, an aviation reporter, an opinion writer, a politician - anyone at all in Australia - who had predicted that Qantas would take what in the words of Mr Joyce -                      at 5 pm was 'an unbelievable decision' -                    The member for Mayo then left the chamber.                     Not a single person in Australia thought that Mr Joyce and the Qantas board would make this decision to lock out its workforce and shut down the airline.                 But it is the case that I have also indicated that, in the lead-up to Saturday, never did Qantas or any trade union call for government intervention into the dispute. Indeed, up until Friday, one day beforehand, the Leader of the Opposition was also not calling for government intervention into the dispute. What we saw on Friday was a front-page story in the Daily Telegraph, with letters from Premier Baillieu and Premier O'Farrell to the Prime Minister that were given to the Daily Telegraph about the same time or before the Prime Minister's office received those letters. That morning, the Leader of the Opposition called for the government to intervene in the dispute - one day before Qantas announced their action and on the day of the Qantas AGM, in which none of the shareholders of Qantas were informed of this plan, even though we know from the Fair Work Australia hearing that Qantas received a report on 20 October about the consequences for safety of a decision to lock out the workforce. But not a word did we hear.                 Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, was asked prior to question time, 'Did anyone from Qantas speak to you or your office prior to Saturday about the possibility of a grounding?' and he could not answer it. He was then asked, 'The question was whether your office was forewarned of the dispute; can you answer that?' and he could not do that either. We know that when they were in office they were a part of a conspiracy -

  To the question from the opposition I say: this continues the pattern of yesterday and it continues its pattern of seeking to mislead the Australian people over this dispute for its base political interests, because it is obviously softening up the ground to try to sell to the Australian people a reintroduction of Work Choices.                 Given the fact that the member who asked the question is misleading and in a pattern of misleading, I refer him to something that happened yesterday morning. That is when Alan Joyce went on Radio National. The member who asked the question should have known about this interview - indeed, he probably did - but there is this pattern of misleading going on. There was the article in the Daily Telegraph yesterday morning that suggested that somehow Alan Joyce was waiting for a call from me. Alan Joyce was asked about this on Radio National yesterday. The question from the interviewer Fran Kelly was: 'Alan Joyce, is it true that the fleet would never have been grounded if the Prime Minister had taken your call' -                      Thank you very much. I am going directly to the question of telephone calls. I know that the facts and the truth are inconvenient for the opposition, but these are the facts. Alan Joyce was asked, 'Is it true that you would not have grounded the fleet if the Prime Minister had taken your call during the CHOGM meeting and promised to intervene directly to end this dispute?' Alan Joyce, in response:                 There is misquotes and misinformation on it. We had talked to three senior ministers. I had no expectation to talk to the Prime Minister. I knew that she was tied up in CHOGM. We had talked to the appropriate ministers _                 Then Fran Kelly comes back again: 'So you weren't waiting on the Prime Minister's call?' 'No. Absolutely not. That is completely misaccurately reported.'                 So misrepresentation No. 1 from the opposition is that somehow a discussion between me and Alan Joyce on Saturday afternoon would have changed Qantas's decision. That is not true, and every member of the opposition who says it is telling the Australian people something that is not true. Qantas determined to ground its fleet on Saturday morning. It determined to engage in a lockout and ground its fleet. We have been critical of that decision. The opposition have not uttered one word of criticism about that. The Qantas decision was the wrong decision: it was the wrong decision by members of the travelling public; it was the wrong decision by the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition utters not one word of criticism of Qantas and seeks to mislead the Australian people about the circumstances of this dispute. And then the opposition, yesterday and today, continue to mislead the Australian people about the provisions of the Fair Work Act, pretending that section 431 is something that can be instantaneously turned on without the minister engaging in a proper process and something that is not subject to legal review. In doing that they seek to mislead the Australian people.                 Now, Mr Speaker, you would ask yourself: why are they seeking to mislead the Australian people about all of this? Why don't they utter a word of criticism about Qantas's decision to lock workers out and ground its fleet? I will leave that for the Leader of the Opposition to answer, but I would suggest to him that, for a man who has been calling for details and the full record of events, he would want to be more fulsome and more direct in his answers to media questions than has been on display today.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. The MRRT is about taxing the most profitable mines, mining the most profitable commodities, so the government decided to tax iron ore, coal, oil and gas. The fact is that gold is mined with a number of other commodities. Gold can be mined with copper; gold can be mined with nickel. The fact is that we would have had extreme complexity if we had decided to tax a number of commodities in a mine and not tax a number of other commodities in the same mine. That was absolutely impossible to do, so we decided entirely for legitimate reasons to tax the most highly profitable mines with the most highly profitable commodities. The alternative would have been to have gone back to a wider range of commodities, but we would not have received the revenue from a wide range of those commodities that would have justified the complexity. That is why the government decided to go for a limited number of highly profitable commodities in a limited number of mines. It made a lot of policy sense; and it makes policy sense today.                 I am pleased to see that the member is a supporter of resource rent taxation. We on this side of the House are strong supporters of resource rent taxation. We believe that the Australian people should get a fair return from the resources they own 100 per cent, which can only be mined once. Given that we have high commodity prices and given that we have the highest terms of trade in 140 years, it is only fair that the Australian people should receive a fair return from that. That is why we have put in place resource rent taxation, particularly when the high terms of trade impact on the economy, push the dollar up and leave us with a patchwork economy. This gives us the capacity to spread the benefits of the mining boom to every corner of our country - to struggling small businesses right around the country. From Tasmania to Western Australia to North Queensland, 2.7 million small businesses will get the instant asset write-off of $6,500 - very important support for small business. That is why it is important to use the revenue to invest in infrastructure and it is also very important to make sure that we support the superannuation savings of Australian workers - 3.5 million Australian workers will get an immediate boost to their superannuation.                  When we say that we are doing something about the patchwork economy, it goes to the core of resource rent taxation, because we understand the need to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around our country. That is why we on this side of the House are strongly supporting resource rent taxation. Those on the other side of the House support lower tax for miners and lower superannuation for Australian workers. We on this side of the House support Australian small businesses with lower taxes and support Australian workers, unlike those on that side of the House.

  I certainly thank the member for Chifley for his question. As a result of the shutdown, at least 68,000 Qantas passengers were affected - 48,000 domestic passengers and 20,000 international passengers. As a result of that, people could not get to businesses; people could not get home to their families. We had people turning up at London Heathrow Airport and other airports not knowing how they could get home. Indeed, last night I spoke to a gentleman who had booked on Qantas, had flown from the United States and was stranded in a Sydney hotel with his 34-week pregnant wife. I intervened because he was unable to get a seat on a plane. My office rang Qantas and they were able to get him and his wife seats to Cairns this morning.                  They are the sorts of personal issues that were raised as a result of this issue. That is why the government was so determined to get this airline up and running. Those opposite ask why we did not do something. The Leader of the Opposition was asked a very clear question on ABC 24 on 14 October: what would be your specific intervention? He was given the opportunity to call for government intervention and he did not do so.                     -                      That is right, and what changed between 14 October and Friday? What changed before Qantas made this decision? One thing changed: the unions -                    The member for Herbert then left the chamber.                     One thing changed in terms of the industrial action. As of Saturday, the only industrial action that was taking place was pilots wearing red ties - that was the only action that was taking place - and making announcements to their members; yet between 14 October when the Leader of the Opposition made that statement and Friday - the same day we had the front page Daily Telegraph article and the same day we had the letters from the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales - the Leader of the Opposition changed his position. We know that earlier on he could not answer the question when journalists asked him, 'When were you told?'                  The Manager of Opposition Business interjected about 'industrial terrorism'. We heard questions yesterday about 'extreme union action' - when it was a lockout by the employer. On this side of the House, it makes no difference whether you have a suit on or a blue collar -                      Extreme action not in the national interest will be condemned by this side of the House. Indeed, I said about Mr Purvinas's comments - for example, in the Australian - I was 'very concerned'. I joined criticism of the secretary Steve Purvinas. I said that Mr Purvinas's comments were 'extraordinary' because 'you need a strong company in order to employ people in order to have union members'. I took action. I condemned the extraordinary action. Those on that side of the House did not. The shadow Treasurer, to be fair, did call for intervention earlier, and I would be interested to know what the shadow Treasurer knew and when, and who he was informed by.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her commitment to ensuring that there is fairness in the workplace. I am asked by the member how Fair Work Australia has operated in the national interest. It has done this by restoring Australian values in the industrial relations framework. Those values of fairness, security, good faith and getting the balance between work and family are Australian values and they are Labor values. But they were not the values that were embodied in Work Choices. They are now embodied in Fair Work Australia.                  Under Work Choices, there was no right to collective bargaining, there was no requirement for the employer to bargain in good faith, and nor was there an ability in circumstances in which the parties could not resolve their issues to have recourse to an independent umpire. As far as the opposition was concerned, they said no to collective bargaining, no to good-faith bargaining and no to an industrial umpire. We said yes to all of those things because they are Australian values.                  I am asked the question about how the implementation of this act has advantaged Australia. It has done it in two ways: not just by restoring values but by ensuring that we got the planes flying again after that precipitous action taken by Qantas over the weekend.                  I am also asked in this question how workers were treated before the implementation of Fair Work Australia. Well, it is Melbourne Cup day, and I always think it is a good thing on Melbourne Cup day to have a look at the form. There was the coalition form - we have talked about it before - the Peter Reith form. Their approach to industrial relations resolution is to bring in the Rottweilers and the black hoods, and sack a workforce and replace it with scabs. But that was Peter Reith. Who became the industrial relations minister after Peter Reith? The current Leader of the Opposition. Abbott continued the process going forward. We know the Leader of the Opposition did not back the former minister for industrial relations Peter Reith in the presidential stakes, but he holds the same form as the former minister for industrial relations.                 I will give you some examples because it also pays in this place to have a corporate memory about how some of these disputes were handled. There was the Morris McMahon dispute, where workers were out on the grass for four months because the employer was not required to bargain in good faith. Workers were paid $11 an hour - and what was the Leader of the Opposition's admonition to them? 'Go back to work because you have a Rolls Royce deal.' Then there was negotiating the auto industry package. He required the industry to pay into a fund so that they could sue workers and unions. Then there was the Tristar Steering dispute where he would not intervene; he said it was not the role of the government to get involved. Then there was the G &amp; K O'Connor dispute, the meatworks where workers were sacked and on the grass for nine months because they had to put up with a 60 per cent wage cut. The Leader of the Opposition stayed out of that dispute, and he refused to disclose his dealings with the company. Doesn't that sound familiar in the context of this Qantas issue today? Here he is. We know that there was engagement with Qantas, but he refuses to disclose what he would have said to Qantas had he picked up the phone. He would have said, 'Continue the dispute.'

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for asking a question that is of interest to literally over 100,000 Australians and people from other countries who are travelling on Qantas, both in Australia and overseas, and who were caught up in this issue. It is an issue that affected employees - they have been trapped in hotels overseas and cannot get back to their families because of this action. It is an issue that is important to the insurance industry, which I will return to in more detail in a moment. What rights travellers have in this - an issue conspicuously absent from the coalition's questions; it took a government member to ask this question - are influenced heavily by the turn of events from Saturday afternoon. The rights of travellers are influenced heavily by the disproportionate and precipitant action of Qantas. They are the people who grounded the planes and now make it a live issue about the insurance rights of people.                 Why is it we never hear the opposition criticise Qantas? Why is it that they only ever criticise one side of the debate? They have been deafeningly silent on what they think about Qantas.                     As much as they may shout my answer down, we know that their industrial relations policy is dial a friend: ring Qantas and find out what to do.                 Of course the reason why travellers in this country need information about their insurance is that Qantas could not manage their employee relations and so in turn chose to damage the economy. An otherwise smart company full of professionals could not do the day job which they are paid to do, which is to encourage their employees on a process of change. Because Qantas could not do their day job properly, travellers now need to find out what their rights are. I have spoken with the Insurance Council of Australia.                   The member for Higgins then left the chamber.                     I have spoken with the Insurance Council of Australia. First of all, they say that travellers inconvenienced should check with Qantas first to see what Qantas will say to them. They tell me that industrial action is normally a predictable event, so sometimes insurance companies will not pay the cost of a lost ticket. The emphasis there is on 'normally a predictable event'. The insurance industry has said that this shutdown was unpredictable. Because of that, insurers, I have been told, not universally -                      If the opposition don't think it was unpredictable, they need to explain their actions.                     The insurers have said that, whilst there cannot be a blanket commitment, they will look sympathetically to claims. They do say they will assess whether or not passengers were able to mitigate their loss and if they were able to get a flight quickly what losses they incurred. Because this is an unpredictable element they are going to be more sympathetic to claims than has traditionally perhaps been the case on other occasions.                 Of course, this comes down to the question of unpredictability. This event was certainly unpredictable to the flying public. It was certainly unpredictable to the tourism industry. It was certainly unpredictable to the mining industry. It was certainly not notified to the government until Saturday afternoon. But of course that does beg the question: who did know? I sat through the 12 hours of hearings in the commission last Sunday and Monday morning. I did not run into any Liberals in the lift queue trying to sort the matter out.                 I do know that Qantas said that easily from 20 October this was on the cards. Of course, there is one other set of actors who can explain whether it was unpredictable. We all know where I am going here, don't we? What did the opposition know? Did you know? Were you informed at any stage? Did some of your former staff members tell you what was going on? Shame!

  The opposition's campaign of misleading continues. I have explained it to the parliament once and I will explain it again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to members of the opposition generally. Section 431 enables the minister for workplace relations to make a declaration. The provision has never been used. It was first introduced into Australian industrial relations law by the Howard government. There were times during this questioning in parliament yesterday when members of the opposition were yelling out: 'What is it for? Why is it there?' Let us just note what the facts are: this provision was introduced by the Liberal government; it enables a minister to make a declaration; it has never been used. So my point before the House yesterday and my point before the House today - and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has taken the point out of context - is that, because it has not been used and because the advice to us is that the ministerial declaration would be capable of judicial review, the use of that ministerial declaration could then have triggered long-running court cases which would have taken us into unknown legal terrain. It has not been used before.                 This is another campaign of misleading by the opposition - day in, day out. The Leader of the Opposition switched his position from government should not intervene to, on Friday, government should intervene, without any explanation as to why he changed his mind between those two points, given the escalation of the dispute did not happen until Sunday, when Qantas notified that it would be locking its staff out. To the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when the Leader of the Opposition changed his mind and the opposition started calling for the use of section 431, the other thing it misled about is the circumstances in which it can be used. It cannot be used just willy-nilly; you have to meet a particular test.                 Then, of course, the opposition has misled about what the minister needs to do. The opposition yesterday and today has continued to mislead and say that all the minister needs to do is instantaneously sign a piece of paper. That is not correct. Because the matter is capable of judicial review, the minister has to have a body of evidence and there is also the prospect that the minister needs to extend procedural fairness to the parties and hear from the parties. When you properly assess, therefore, what you need to do under section 431, it means you end up in proceedings, effectively, very like -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So the opposition has consistently raised the spectre that the minister could have just dashed off a declaration. That is not legally correct.                 Then, what the opposition has consistently failed to acknowledge is that the government, in taking the action that it took, ensured that this dispute was brought to an end. I do note - because I think for completeness on the public record it should be noted - the relevant department advised the government to take the proceedings under the section that the government chose to use.                   So, for all of this campaign of misleading, I would say to the opposition: the government acted to bring this dispute to an end. We are concerned about the national economy and the travelling public. We are concerned about balance in the workplace relations system. The truth is, looking at the government and the opposition, the only people concerned about the travelling public and the only people concerned about balance in the workplace relations system are the government.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I would like to inform the House that the Reserve Bank today has announced it will cut the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent - a decision just announced. As the nation gets ready for the race which stops us once a year, the Melbourne Cup, this will be a welcome relief for Australian families who are under cost-of-living pressures.                 I understand that despite our strong economic fundamentals, and they are strong, parts of the community are doing it very tough and finding it very hard to make the family accounts add up to get the bills paid. So this news will come as welcome relief to them. It will be relief for families too as we move towards the festive season, when people want to make arrangements for Christmas and Christmas holidays.                 Importantly, today's decision by the Reserve Bank confirms this government's strong economic management credentials. We do understand that families are under cost-of-living pressure and that is why we have introduced a range of measures to assist families, including increasing the childcare tax rebate to 50 per cent and creating the education tax refund to help with the costs of getting kids to schools. We are going to deliver an increase of $4,200 in family tax benefit A for the mums and dads who have teenagers, and, of course, we have brought in paid parental leave to help parents of very young babies. And we have secured an economy where 95 out of every 100 Australians who want a job have got a job. Our focus has always been on making sure that Australians have the benefits and dignity of work, and that is why we moved to put economic stimulus into our economy, to keep jobs for Australians when the global financial crisis threatened.                 We have also come through with a strict fiscal discipline plan and we are delivering the fastest fiscal consolidation on record. The delivery of that fiscal consolidation and getting the budget back into surplus - back into the black - as promised, is very important. The government's strict fiscal strategy means we have created space in the economy for it to grow without adding to price pressures. You run a strict fiscal policy in order not to put upwards pressure on inflation, and that helps the RBA have the room it needs to move on monetary policy.                 At the same time, our strong public finances continue to be the envy of the world. That point will come home to me very forcefully, I am sure, as I attend the G20 in coming days, where I will meet with leaders of other economies who are struggling with debt, who are struggling with high unemployment rates and who are struggling with the prospect of how they deal with their budgets, whilst we here, of course, have strong public finances, we have Australians in jobs and we are bringing the budget into surplus by engaging in strong fiscal consolidation.                 We live in the right region of the world at the right time in history. Economic weight is moving from west to east. Our economy is strong now and we must keep reforming and changing to ensure that we maximise the benefits of the Asian century in which we live. Today's announcement by the Reserve Bank will be good news for Australian families to help take that bit of pressure off on this Melbourne Cup day.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Let me do two things: one, direct the House's attention to the complete paragraph that the shadow Treasurer quoted from; and, two, deal with his question about banks and passing interest rates on. I think it is very important that the House gets the full paragraph. I will refer to the full Reserve Bank statement and then I will refer to the paragraph that the shadow Treasurer referred to. The paragraph says:                 Information about the Australian economy suggests moderate growth overall. The terms of trade have now peaked and will decline somewhat in the near term, but they remain very high.                 In response, investment in the resources sector is picking up very strongly, with much more to come. Some related service sectors are enjoying better-than-average conditions. In other sectors, cautious behaviour by households and the high exchange rate have had a noticeable dampening effect. The unemployment rate has increased a little over recent months, though it remains close to 5%.                 That paragraph of the Reserve Bank statement is pointing to the patchwork economy that the government talks about consistently. When you have a patchwork economy with resources steaming ahead and, as a result, the Australian dollar at historical high levels and sustained high levels, that does put pressure on other sectors of the economy that are trade exposed, including manufacturing. We have been talking about that for months and months and months - talking about the patchwork economy and how we are responding to it.                     Before the opposition starts its little chant, one of the ways we are responding to it is through the minerals resource rent tax, because that is a pivotal instrument in a patchwork economy where you take more tax from the sector of the economy that is turbocharged and use that to spread economic growth throughout the rest of the economy. The only people in denial about the patchwork economy -                      I am responding to the first part of the question. I was concerned that the way in which it was phrased may mislead people about the Reserve Bank statement, and, because we constantly see negativity and misleading from the opposition, I have taken the opportunity to ensure that that misleading does not stand unchallenged. In relation to that negativity by the opposition, my point was -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In concluding on the first part of the question, which refers to the description of the patchwork economy in the Reserve Bank statement, the government has been explaining the patchwork economy to the Australian people for some time now. It proves the importance of the minerals resource rent tax, taxing the sector of the economy that is streaking ahead, to facilitate growth in other parts of the economy and opportunity for all. The Liberal Party are the only people in the nation who really believe that miners are paying too little tax.                 On the second part of the shadow Treasurer's question, let me be very clear about this: I believe that Australian banks should pass on this interest rate cut in full. I said this morning to the media that, if the RBA cut interest rates today, Australian banking customers would be looking to their banks to cut interest rates in full. I believe that is what the Australian people want to see from the banks that they bank with. We have acted to increase banking competition. We believe that was very important. But let me be loud and clear about this: I believe the Australian community is looking to banks today to announce that they will pass this interest rate cut on in full.

  I thank the number for Fraser for his question. Today's decision is a win for Australian families with mortgages and it is a win for small businesses, whichever horse they back today. Those opposite have been asking questions about whether the banks should pass this interest rate cut through in full. Well, they should pass this through in full. Indeed, there is no excuse for not passing this through in full. Westpac has today announced a full pass-through of 25 basis points. This is a welcome decision in households with very large mortgages and it is certainly welcomed by small businesses.                 The government, for its part, has done its bit. As the Prime Minister was saying before, we have put in place the fastest fiscal consolidation in history, and that has been recognised by both the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank as being very important in terms of their deliberations. We are playing our part with fiscal policy.                 Some points were made about the statement from the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank clearly points to the fact that inflation is moderating, that underlying inflation is back within the target band. They also make the point that there are adverse international conditions. These two factors, along with the government's fiscal policy, were what led them to take rates back to what they describe as neutral. Fiscal policy is very important in this. The government has put in place its fiscal policy because we do not want to add to inflationary pressures in our economy. That is why we have the fastest fiscal consolidation - that is, return to surplus - in our history.                 Over and above that, the banks have a part to play as well. All banks should pass on this 25-point cut in full. One of the reasons why we have put in place a comprehensive package of competition reforms is that, if people are unhappy with their bank, they can walk down the road and get a better deal. That is why we have been steadily implementing fundamental reforms such as the abolition of mortgage exit fees, reforms to credit cards and so on - so the market is more competitive. So if somebody is unhappy with their bank, they can walk down the road and get a better deal.

  The minister has made it very clear what the circumstances were here in terms of discussion between Qantas and the government -                      And no amount of yelling from an opposition that does not want to hear the facts about this dispute and is engaging in its own acts of not being straightforward - anybody who saw the Leader of the Opposition's press conference earlier today saw a man who was clearly shuffling around not sure what to say next. So we are still awaiting the full version on the public record of the opposition and Qantas. So, before we hear little bits of jeering from an opposition that has not been straightforward itself, let us be very clear about what the government has said in this place, and beyond, over the -                      What I was saying about the things that the government said in this place during the course of question time today, yesterday and also outside this place - and the Minister for Transport has made this very clear - is that the prospect of Qantas locking out its staff and immediately grounding its aircraft was not raised with the government. It was notified to the government on Saturday. As a result of the notification on Saturday the government took the action which caused the industrial dispute to come to an end so that Qantas planes could get back in the sky, and they have been back in the sky since yesterday afternoon.                 We do understand that the opposition has a different view from us about this. We are in the world of industrial relations balance, of looking after the interests of employers and employees, of caring about the travelling public. We are in the world of competently managing when there is disputation and bringing it to an end. The opposition is in the world of not criticising Qantas, of not being concerned at all about the travelling public, of always denying the rights of working people and of doing whatever it is told to do by employers. That was its track record in government and it continues to be its track record in opposition. And I know that the Leader of the Opposition has been disappointed in the past few days. The only people in Australia unhappy when Fair Work Australia ended industrial action were the members of the Liberal Party sitting opposite. The only people in Australia unhappy when the Reserve Bank announced its interest rate cut were the members opposite. You could see the disappointment written all over their faces.

  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I know that all members have a pressing engagement, so let me be very brief. I will proceed this evening from Australia to France for the G20 meeting. This is a very important meeting at a time when two big engines of the global economy are misfiring at the same time - that is, the economy in Europe and the United States economy. We have been very vocal about the need for Europe to put its house in order. We have seen a framework emerge from European leaders. Now in the context of the G20, we need to ensure that this framework ends up in concrete steps which are implemented to deal with the sovereign debt problems out of Greece and other nations, to deal with financial stability in Europe, to deal with fiscal consolidation needed in Europe and to make sure we do not see contagion in the banking sector.                 The meeting is important for matters beyond the actions that need to be taken in Europe. It comes at a time when we do need to see a lift in global growth. The global economy does need a shot in the arm. We will certainly be lifting our voices in support of freer trade and ending the gridlock over the Doha Round because the global economy does need that shot in the arm. We will also be lifting our voices for the need for economies to act in a way that bolsters global growth for developed economies like our own. That means looking for new sources of growth like clean energy futures and the new sources of growth that can be realised from the National Broadband Network and new technologies. For developing nations that means that people need to confront hard questions of market-based currency arrangements. I will be at the G20 putting Australia's case on these questions on the need for global growth, global balance and trade.                 Mr Speaker, given that time is short, with those words it may be an appropriate moment for question time to end and for people to meet a commitment they would like to meet. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  The first point is to acknowledge the tragedy which has occurred off Indonesia and the tragic loss of life. That is why we on this side of the House have been so determined to break the people smugglers' model and to do it through genuine regional engagement, to send a message to the people smugglers that their model is broken and it will not work. That is why the government has been so intent in putting together this regional solution. That is why it was such a shame and a tragedy that the legislation that we needed to put in place because of the High Court decision has not been able to pass this parliament, because that is the only measure that can be taken to break the people smugglers' model.                 Those opposite are not interested in genuine solutions to this problem. For our part, we extend to them again an invitation to come to this House with good heart and acknowledge that we need a regional solution to stop the boats from coming. They have been advised by all of our senior advisers that the approaches they are putting forward will not work. For our part, we remain committed to a genuine regional solution. The Malaysian arrangement is precisely the sort of humanitarian arrangement that is required to ensure that we break that model. Until we break that model, we will see tragic deaths at sea. I happened to be Acting Prime Minister last December when that boat hit Christmas Island. I will never forget that day. That is one of the reasons that we are so keen to break the people smugglers' model and put in place a regional arrangement that deals properly with this matter so we can save lives.

  I thank the member for Hunter for this very important question. It goes to major taxation reform in Australia. It goes to our capacity as a nation to spread the benefits of the resources boom across all sections of the Australian community at this very important point in time. It maintains our nation's international attractiveness from an investment point of view. It ensures that we share the benefits of the record commodity prices and, I might say, the record profits that are being earned by the resource and energy investors in Australia.                 Let us go to the opposition, yet again, by the coalition led by Tony Abbott to this major reform. Let us think about the accusations he made just on 12 months ago about this proposed spreading of the benefits to all Australians in terms of killing investment in Australia. We have an investment pipeline of $430 billion. In LNG alone, we have $140 billion committed and more coming. This is about jobs and training opportunities for Australians, often in regional and remote communities. It also goes to the fact that we have record commodity prices at the moment.                 But just think about this in terms of mining investment. When the tax was announced in 2009-10, investment skyrocketed from $35 billion to $47 billion in 2010-11 and is expected to be around $80 billion in 2011-12. I also indicate that we are seeing the benefit of this in terms of the achievements with respect to the record sales of Australian resource and energy exports - an increase from 2009-10 of 27 per cent to $175 billion in 2010-11 and a projected increase of a further 21 per cent to $215 billion to 2011-12. Then we go to the question of the profits. This is what the Leader of the Opposition has to think about: why shouldn't the whole Australian community get a fair share, for example, of the increase of 76 per cent in FMG's latest profit to $985 billion? Why shouldn't they get a share of Rio's profits - a record US$14.32 billion; a record that it will break this year? Why shouldn't it get a share of BHP Billiton's $22.48 billion in profits - an 86 per cent increase on the previous year?                 We are very fortunate as a nation and are well placed in terms of the great opportunities in Asia. We are rich in commodities and we are rich in terms of energy opportunities. Our responsibility as a government, with a strong dollar and pressure on other sections of the economy, is to spread these benefits to all Australians. That is not just about ordinary workers in terms of an increase in superannuation; it is also about assistance to business at large. It is about cutting business taxation, it is about giving support to small business for new capital investment and it is about investment in productivity initiatives and infrastructure in places such as Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.                 It is time the Leader of the Opposition took his head out of the sand. He was wrong when he said in the West Australian op-ed of 20 August 2010 that this decision would threaten thousands of jobs in WA and threaten investment. Wake up to the fact that Australians are entitled to a share of the one-off opportunity to develop their resources. Share the benefits and stop being so pigheaded in opposition to any major reform in Australia.

  I see the shadow minister talked about reopening Nauru, which the government have been advised, by all of our advisers - the same advisers who advised them when they were in government - that Nauru simply does not work. A few minutes ago, the former member for Cook was on Sky News, and this is what he had to say. He said:                 Seventy per cent of those who were processed in Nauru then went on to receive settlement grants.                 That is, they came to Australia. This is not the deterrent that those opposite pretend it is.                     I was making the point that there is not a shred of policy credibility in Nauru, which is what those opposite are saying. That is why this government -                      All they want to do is play politics with this issue. On this very day, after we have seen another significant tragedy, with people dying at sea, their priority is to come in here and run these sorts of tawdry political lines. What we on this side of the House want to see and what the Australian people want to see is a genuine solution to this problem. They want to see a solution which looks at the humanitarian concerns. They do not want to see people dying at sea. They want to see a government that can put in place policies which break the people smugglers' model, and we know very clearly that Nauru does not do that, which is why we have always sought a genuine regional solution and we will continue to support a genuine regional solution. They can continue to play politics, but we are not going to see them there.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question because she is interested in the idea that people who work hard all their life should be able to retire with some degree of dignity and income security. That is why the legislation that went into the House this morning is so good for so many Australians. That is why the mining tax is unreservedly a very good idea, because it is going to spread the prosperity of the mining boom across all of Australia.                 I have no doubt that the member for Robertson's constituents, and indeed 8.4 million Australians, will be pleased to learn that today this government has continued the work of lifting compulsory superannuation to a point where more Australians than ever before can hope that they can retire with some adequate level of replacement income in the years after retirement. Australians know that we are living longer than ever before. The evidence sits opposite me. We are living longer than ever before and in those years we need to make sure that people have enough money to live on. We need to make sure that people have enough to retire on. The current compulsory superannuation savings of nine per cent are simply not adequate. We need to lift it to 12 per cent. We are managing to do it in a staged way, which means business will be able to work with the increases. It will be of a quarter of a per cent in 2013-14, a quarter of a per cent the following year and then five instalments of half a per cent up until 2019-20. This country and this government understand that it is not fair that, in Australia, only a few very wealthy people will have sufficient to retire on. We on this side of the House say: if some Australians are getting better than nine per cent superannuation, why isn't it good enough for 8Â½ million people?                 But the good news for Australians does not stop with that aspect of the government's measures. I am also pleased to report to the House that today we are proposing to eliminate the concessional tax paid by all Australians who go to work and earn less than $37,000 a year. That's right: we are going to remove the 15 per cent concessional tax so that 3.6 million Australians on low incomes, rather than having to pay tax on their superannuation, will receive it in their superannuation. It is worth noting that 60 per cent of these 3.6 million people, our fellow Australians who are working hard, are women. We understand that women are not paid equally to men in many sectors of the economy. We also understand that women will sometimes have to take breaks in their careers and reduce their potential earnings to raise families. We do not believe that women should miss out on the benefits of the superannuation system for this reason. That is why we are introducing the scheme.                 But the good news continues further. This government today announced that we will scrap the age discrimination levels for everyone who goes to work. In other words, no longer will you have to lose your superannuation contributions when you are 70. We said at the last election - unlike those opposite - that we would raise it to 75, but courtesy of the good work of the Labor backbench and the crossbenches we have been persuaded, and today we announce that we will scrap that. So the 18,000 Australians in the workforce who are over the age of 75 will be able to get superannuation.                     I hear the opposition crowing, 'That's our policy!' Well, I tell you what: if it is your policy, vote for it. And, while you are voting for it, don't keep 15 per cent just for yourselves and vote for the rest of Australia to get nine per cent. Shame on your hypocrisy!

  I am not in a position to confirm that at all, because I was not there last week. But what I certainly am -                      I am certainly in a position to confirm that the government is still actively pursuing a regional solution through the able leadership of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. That is what we are doing because that is what the national interest demands.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. He has had a very close interest in health in Tasmania since he was elected. He has a bit of competition in this House because our four Labor Party members in Tasmania - the members for Bass, Braddon, Franklin and Lyons - also are passionately concerned about the situation in Tasmania at the moment. I appreciate the question because it gives me an opportunity to put on the record, on behalf of the government, that we are extremely disappointed about the cuts to health services in Tasmania. This is a particularly disappointing decision by the Tasmanian government when, just three months ago, they signed on to the national health reform with our government. The Tasmanian Premier said at that time:                 This agreement will ensure that our health system can remain strong and reliable into the future _                 The Tasmanian health minister said that it will also lead to improved patient access to services, including 'faster access to emergency departments and elective surgery procedures', so we were surprised to see that there were cuts to the Tasmanian health system.                     In contrast to members opposite - including the member for Dickson, who has not asked me a question for more than 800 days in this House - we are investing $2.3 billion into the Tasmanian health system. In fact, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released a report just last week that showed not only are we investing historic amounts in capital infrastructure in Tasmania but we are also the majority funders of Tasmanian public hospital services. So we are making a significant investment and we expect the Tasmanian government to continue with their investments. We are not planning a takeover of the Tasmanian health system. We have negotiated a true partnership with them and we expect them to stick to their part of the deal.                 I also want to put on the record here that throughout the negotiations the Tasmanian government did make very clear that they were worried about reaching the elective surgery targets in our national health reform. They made that clear to me; they made that clear to the Prime Minister. What they never, ever made clear was that they would cut money and, of course, would therefore never be able to reach those targets. We are prepared to work with the Tasmanian government to look at the way they can maintain their effort in the health system and to look at any special circumstances that might apply for Tasmania. But we are proud of what we are investing in, whether it is the hundreds of millions of dollars in the redevelopment of the Royal Hobart Hospital, whether it is the nearly $200 million in running the Mersey Hospital in Braddon, whether it is the integrated cancer centre that is just about to open in Launceston, whether it is the three GP superclinics that are already up and running in Tasmania. We will continue to invest for the benefit of Tasmanian patients and we expect the state government to do the same.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Qantas has confirmed that the first time it advised the government that there was any consideration of a lockout of its workforce and a grounding of the fleet was after 2 pm on Saturday. The government acted immediately. By 10 pm the government was with the office of Fair Work Australia seeking a stop to this decision. Just over 24 hours later, we had the decision that ensured that Qantas planes returned to the air on Monday afternoon. Today Qantas is back, running its full schedule. The parties have 21 days to get an agreement done and the government calls upon both Qantas and the trade unions to bargain in good faith during this time and get this deal done in the interests of Qantas and in the interests of its workforce. Both parties must show some maturity. The response of the community to this proposed lockout and grounding has been extraordinary, because when you lock out a workforce and shut down an airline you also lock out the customers. So we need to make sure that this deal gets done.                 We know - because Qantas has confirmed it - when we were told. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday confirmed that he was called about the specific 5 pm grounding on Saturday. What he has not said is when he was told that they were considering locking out the workforce and grounding their fleet.                     I am asked about the circumstances leading up to the Qantas decision to lock out its workforce and ground its fleet, and I think that the Australian public are entitled to know.                      It is true that the Leader of the Opposition changed his position with regard to intervention last Friday.                      What is also true is that the shadow Treasurer had for some time called for government intervention. Last night we saw the shadow Treasurer on the 7.30 report melt down when he was asked when he knew that Qantas was considering locking out its workforce and grounding its fleet. He said that he could not recall.                     I can understand the sensitivity there.                      It is quite extraordinary that the shadow Treasurer of the nation is told that Qantas is considering locking out its workforce, with all the implications for the national economy, and he says, 'I cannot recall when I was told.' With that sort of memory, no wonder he cannot find the $70 billion that is down that black hole.                     With that sort of memory, no wonder he cannot find that $70 billion. The shadow Treasurer and others need to come clean about when they were told that Qantas was considering locking out its workforce.

  I thank the member for her question. She entered this parliament on the basis of restoring dignity to workers, and the government that she joined did that. It did it by replacing the discredited Work Choices legislation with Fair Work Australia. Very interestingly, in that excruciating interview that the member for North Sydney was involved in last night, when he was asked what their IR policy was, he said, 'It's the government's policy; we don't intend to change it.' So that policy that they went to the election on, that they got trounced on, they have now ditched. But does anyone believe them? On this side of the House we do not.                 So far as restoring dignity to the workplace goes, we did it in a number of ways. We restored fairness, we restored dignity, we restored good-faith bargaining and, most of all, we restored balance. Industrial relations, when those opposite sat in office, was to take a one-sided approach, to always back the employer and bash the worker. We not only restored all of those values - Australian values, Labor values - but enshrined them in legislation.                 I am also asked how our legislation supported the economy. It supported it in a number of ways. Over four years we have seen the fastest employment growth ever in the history of this country, and that is projected to double in the next eight years. That has been done on the basis of restoring fairness as well as the sound fiscal and economic policies that this government has introduced. We have also lowered industrial disputes compared to the number there were when the Liberals were in office. Most recently, we demonstrated how, by using the act, we could get Qantas flying again, after Qantas took the precipitous decision of locking out its workforce and grounding the airline.                 I go again to the interview that the member for North Sydney sweated over - as well he might - last night. In that interview, when he was asked the question:                 _ When did you first hear _ that it was considering the option of grounding its fleet or locking out staff?                 he said: 'Oh, weeks ago.' So here is the member for North Sydney at least admitting that it was weeks ago that they knew. So here is the Labor government -                      working in the national interest to get the airline flying again and the member for North Sydney, acting in his own -                      grubby political interests, to make sure that their instrument of choice continues - the lockout -                      I am asked, Mr Speaker, how the workers were treated under previous legislation. Let me also remind people of the so-called call for early intervention, that there had been a cacophony on in terms of us. In that excruciating interview last night, he referred to his intervention when he was the minister for industrial relations in the Tristar dispute. He acknowledges that. Let me tell you about that intervention in terms of expedition, because that dispute had been going for 18 months.                     The Prime Minister of the day asked you to intervene; you said that you did -                      And how did the minister intervene? He intervened by urging bosses of the car parts worker to sack its entire workforce and re-employ them on individual contracts. That is the attitude they would take to industrial relations. It is not the Labor way but it is the Liberal way.

  I am quite disappointed in that question from the Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, the implication in the question is completely inaccurate; we have come to expect that. But what we have seen in the last 24 hours, particularly from the shadow Treasurer, is that the bipartisan support for the IMF that has spanned conservative and Labor governments over something like 60 years has now been broken. How low will they go? They should know, because this was the practice when they were in government, that any loans made to the IMF are repaid with interest. That was the situation under conservative governments and it is the situation under this government.                 Secondly, and this is more important, the government is not proposing to put any money into a European rescue fund. That is just false - completely false. What we have seen is a xenophobic approach, particularly in the last 24 hours, by the shadow Treasurer, who has been out there blowing the dog whistle that somehow Australia was going to be propping up Greece. Well, we are not. But what we are going to proudly do is meet our commitments to the IMF, as governments of both political persuasions have done for over 60 years.                 There is a very serious situation in the global economy at the moment. Whilst our fundamentals are strong, Australia is not immune from the fallout of these events in Europe and also in the United States. It is a difficult situation when two of the big global groupings in the economy are misfiring. That does have consequences for Australia. What we have said and what other G20 finance ministers have said - and I am sure other G20 leaders are saying it as we meet today - is that the world will meet its obligations through the IMF to ensure that the IMF has the capacity in the future to deal with greater global volatility which flows from Europe.                 Around the world, conservative governments favour that approach, governments of our persuasion favour that approach and governments of the persuasion of those opposite have favoured that approach: giving the IMF the resources that it needs. The IMF does not have the capacity to contribute directly to any European fund, but what I have said and what the Prime Minister has said is that the IMF must be properly resourced for the future because we are entering into a period of great volatility which brings threats to the global economy and Australia is not immune from those threats. We will pay our fair share through the IMF, as we have always done, but that will be by way of loans, which are repaid with interest.

  I do thank the member for Capricornia for that very important question because she does represent an area in this country which is producing an enormous amount of wealth for Australia and, like many other mineral-producing regions and resource-producing regions, that region suffers the stresses that come with the mining boom, as well as many of the great benefits. What this side of the House is really proud of is that we have put forward a landmark Labor reform, which makes sure that very profitable mining companies, superprofitable mining companies are returning some of those superprofits to the Australian people for the resources the Australian people own 100 per cent and which can only be mined once.                  We are proud of what we are doing in this House to ensure that we then spread the benefits of that boom to every corner of our economy, because we do have a strong but a patchwork economy in Australia. Not every small business and not every family is in the fast lane of the resources boom. The whole idea of resource rent taxation is to take those superprofits and give a hand to those people who are not in the fast lane. The first place we can do that is with a very significant tax cut for small business - 2.7 million small businesses right around Australia getting the benefit of the $6,500 instant asset write-off, a huge boost to the cash flow of small businesses right around this country. They are looking forward to that.                  We will also invest in infrastructure in many of these regions where they are really pressed for roads and other social infrastructure through strong population growth. We are doing this particularly in Western Australia and other places where the mining industry is strong, like the Illawarra or the Hunter in New South Wales and in Queensland - taking the benefits of the boom, spreading them around the country. The thing we are most proud of is investing in the superannuation of Australian workers. That is just fantastic: building the savings of Australian workers, particularly low-income-earning workers; 8.4 million individual sovereign wealth funds all benefiting from our changes to superannuation. And who is opposing this? Those opposite - Dr No over there, no to everything. They do not think it is good to use the superprofits to assist people who are not in the fast lane. Now that the legislation has come into the House - and they are going to oppose it - they are arguing for a tax increase for small business. They are arguing for lower superannuation savings for Australian workers. This just shows how out of touch they are, how economically illiterate they are and how completely incapable they are of running a modern economy.

  Australia's position is that we will support an expansion of IMF funds under the principles and guidelines used by the IMF, but the IMF will not be contributing to a European rescue fund in the way in which the shadow Treasurer has indicated today.

  This government's priority when we were informed about the lockout of the workforce and the grounding of the fleet on Saturday was to go to Fair Work Australia and to make sure that we got Qantas back up in the air, because this was not just a lockout of its workforce, it was a lockout of its customers. It is a bit like Telstra having a disagreement with one of its unions and shutting down the telecommunications industry. It is like one of the energy companies, because it is having a problem with one of the unions, turning off the lights and shutting down the power system. It is like one of the water companies having a problem with one of its unions and shutting off the water system. That is why this government thinks that this was an irresponsible and extreme action and why we are so surprised that those opposite have shown their ideological obsession by saying not one word of criticism against Qantas.                 The parties now, as a result of our action, have 21 days to bargain. We are of the view that parties should talk to each other and settle an agreement rather than engage in militant action, whether it be by employers or employees - either way we oppose. I am advised that Qantas and the pilots have already had one meeting before Fair Work Australia this week. The licensed engineers will meet with Qantas before Fair Work Australia next Monday to continue their negotiations. The Transport Workers Union and Qantas will return to Fair Work Australia next Tuesday. This is a good thing - that we have bargaining in good faith.                 It is important to note that Fair Work Australia found that there were good prospects for agreement between the parties prior to Qantas's decision to lock out its workforce and ground its fleet. So I encourage all parties and, indeed, have spoken to all parties to encourage them to get this deal done in the interests of this important, iconic Australian company, in the interests of its workforce and in the national interest. Of course, that has been our approach the whole way through.                 The shadow Treasurer confirmed on the 7.30 program that he knew that Qantas was considering a lockout of its workforce. When asked when he was told, he said: 'Well, I can't recall. Well, I can't recall.' That was his position when told about an action that would be of such damage to the Australian economy - he could not recall when he was told. It is not surprising that he cannot find the $70 billion, that he cannot find a policy on anything at all -                      Today he objected to debating the minerals resource rent tax because he thought it was a new idea he did not see coming. They actually tried to adjourn the debate because they could not see it coming.                 Our priority is for all parties, and I call upon them to do it, to bargain in good faith - Qantas and the unions - and make sure they get these arrangements agreed in the interests of themselves and in the interests of the nation.

  The decision by the NAB not to pass on the Reserve Bank rate cut in full was a greedy decision. It is completely and utterly unjustified by any of the fundamentals when it comes to their borrowing requirements. I conveyed my view directly to the chief executive, Mr Cameron Clyne. I passed it on a very directly. I did not only make my views public, I put them privately as well - as I have done when, on other occasions, banks have done that. And I will continue to do that when I believe these decisions are unjustified.                 The reason the government has put in place a comprehensive package of banking reforms is to enable customers that are unhappy with their bank to go down the road -                      I know they are not interested in competition in the banking system but I will go on and talk about the government's proposals, which are currently being implemented, to make sure our banking system is much more competitive. One of the reforms that we put in place which has been opposed by those opposite is the abolition of mortgage exit fees. The shadow Treasurer opposed our proposition to abolish mortgage exit fees, which has led to a reduction of mortgage exit fees and the abolition of mortgage exit fees by the National Australia Bank. So, in these circumstances, if you have a mortgage with the NAB and you are unhappy with their decision you can walk down the road as a result of reforms this government has put in place.                     Come in spinner! The interjection was that they have a lower rate. They do not have a lower rate than many other financial institutions: there are plenty of credit unions out there with a lower rate than the NAB. If their customers are unhappy they can walk down the road and get a better rate.

  We should call a spade a spade. The fact is that there is a completely unjustified campaign, run by a number of organisations that describe themselves as 'smaller miners', that somehow this tax discriminates against small miners. This tax does not discriminate against small miners and it will be paid predominantly by very large miners. Mr Forrest is here today, and he was part of a press conference, and he claims to be a small miner. He has a $20 billion company! A $20 billion company is not a small miner.                  We made a range of changes to the tax over a period of time in what has been probably the most open and transparent process that any piece of tax legislation has ever been put through. We went through the Ferguson-Argus review, and there were comprehensive submissions made right through that process. It has been through two rounds of consultation through the tax office. But let us get rid of this bunkum that the tax somehow discriminates against small miners. It does not. We have even put in a new threshold where it is not paid under $50 million and it phases out through to $100 million. This is complete rubbish. As far as Mr Forrest is concerned, when he put on the public record all of the changes he wanted, on 29 June last year, we implemented every single one of them.                     We have been through a comprehensive process of consultation on this legislation, and there are some who are unhappy about it because the truth is that they do not want to pay any tax. They want to mine the mineral, which is owned 100 per cent by Australians, which can only be dug up once, which has gone to record prices, and they do not want the Australian people to get a fair return. The consequence of that is that struggling small businesses right around this country will pay more and there will be less in the superannuation savings of millions of workers. That is what they stand for, and that is what those on that side of the House stand for. They have always stood with vested interest. We stand for working families.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She, like all of those who sit on this side of the House, was delighted when the Rudd government was able to replace the discredited Work Choices legislation with the Fair Work Act - an act that brought dignity and fairness back into the industrial relations system and brought a structure to the system where negotiations broke down. Why has it been important for the economy? This week has been a classic example as to why. By utilising the Fair Work Act and by moving decisively and quickly, we got Qantas back in the air again. That required two things. It required an act that gave us the framework, but it also required a government that was prepared to make the right decision at the right time.                 I contrast that with the circumstances which would have existed had those who sit opposite been in power at the time. Not only would there not have been an act that provided that framework; the actions of those who sit opposite would have been to let the dispute run on. We know that the member for North Sydney has admitted to knowing weeks in advance that Qantas was planning to lock out its workforce and ground its air fleet, but he said nothing. There was the Australian government acting in the national interest as soon as it knew what Qantas's intentions were, and the member for North Sydney was sitting it out - grubby political interests, hoping that this dispute would worsen and impact upon the economy and thereby the government.                 I had the opportunity to listen to the member's personal explanation yesterday in relation to his view about how decisively they moved when they were in office. I refer back to the Tristar dispute, and I will remind members of the true facts of this dispute. This was a prolonged dispute that had been running for 18 months. The employer's strategy was to let the collective bargain expire so that they would not be required to pay workers' entitlements - run down the clock. That government failed to do anything in those circumstances. I am asked how it compares with the system we replaced, and I am giving an example of that. The intervention that the member for North Sydney talked about was in relation to one person, a man that was dying. He did get his worker entitlements for him, but not for the whole of the workforce. They refused to act in so many circumstances under their legislation, under their system, to protect workers' entitlements. The only time they acted was in relation to the then Prime Minister's brother's company, National Textiles. Remember? Not Tristar, not the coal industry, only National Textiles.                   That was a government that would not support workers' entitlements. When it came to intervening under their system, let me say what was on the record in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. The company, Tristar, stood by a memo written after the meeting with Mr Hockey in which it quotes, 'It wanted this issue sorted out and implied that, if we did not, there would be ramifications.' They would sack the workforce and replace it.

  There is a very simple answer to that question because the report, which I have read, from the Economist Intelligence Unit is not worth the paper it is written on.                     They got it wrong. The fact is that we had produced -                      Well, it is a fact.                   The member for Dickson then left the chamber.                     I know those opposite think we live in a post-fact world. That is demonstrated in here every day of the week when it comes to basic facts about the economy, about levels of borrowing, about the IMF, about the NBN and about just about anything else. On this occasion they want to quote one report, but the evidence is contradicted by just about every other reputable report on the NBN that has been done around the world. I will quote someone that they like to quote occasionally, Mr Alan Kohler. He said:                 Not only will the NBN not be a white elephant it will almost certainly prove to be a great investment. In fact, without wishing to get carried away _ it could represent, on its own, a huge national savings plan. When it's finished the asset will be worth several times the government's investment of $27.5 billion.                 End of story.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She, more than most members in this House, understands the importance of the mining boom and also appreciates, due to the diverse nature of the South Coast of New South Wales, the impact it is having on other sections of her local community.                 The member for Cunningham is very supportive of the fact that, at the moment, mining industry companies in Australia are actually making record profits. The message she has received from the Australian community, which was under the pump because of the impact of the resources sector on the broader community, is that the rest of the community actually needs a helping hand. That is what the debate on the mining tax is about. It is about how we spread the benefit of this boom to the broader Australian community. That is not about stifling investment.                  The record speaks for itself. Contrary to the arguments presented by the coalition in this House today, there is no sovereign risk. In Australia at the moment, $430 billion is planned or committed to capital investment. Look at the skyrocketing of investment - from $35 billion in 2009-10 to an expected $80 billion in 2011-12. And there is more significant investment to come Australia's way. It is built off the back of record commodity prices and good profits - and we are very, very pleased for those companies.                 But the time has come to spread these benefits to ensure, for example, that we assist the tourism industry. That is not to deny that there is going to continue to be job growth in the mining sector. Importantly, jobs growth in the mining sector has continued, with almost 30,000 jobs created in 2010-11. It is also expected that at least 70,000 new operational jobs will be created in the mining sector by 2015. That is good for young people seeking a terrific career opportunity.                 But we also have to make sure that we look after small business. I find it amazing that the coalition is opposed to cutting taxation for small businesses, many of which actually operate in the tourism sector I have responsibility for, and is actually willing to vote against giving them some assistance in the purchase of new capital equipment. Why should they not have that assistance, given the huge impact that the strength of the Australian dollar is having on them at the moment, both in terms of international visitation and the fact that so many Australians are doing well and are going overseas for a holiday? We have to make sure that we assist small business through this change in mining taxation.                 More importantly, it is supported by many, many mining companies in Australia, because in some ways they are embarrassed by the profits they are receiving at the moment and they think it is their social responsibility to spread the benefits to the Australian community. It would also mean that we would have the capacity to invest in infrastructure which is not only important to the resources sector but also important to the tourism sector. The Gateway project in Western Australia to improve airport access is a prime example of benefits going not only to the resources sector but to the whole Australian community.                 In conclusion, it is about time the coalition fronted up to its social responsibilities to ensure that all Australians get a fair share of this once-in-a-century opportunity, this resources boom. Step back and review your position and do not be so antagonistic to sharing these benefits and so denying small business and those sections of the Australian community who are actually doing it a little bit tough at this point in our history.

  I would have thought it was very clear: we have a different policy from the Canadians. There are a few points that ought to be made here, because the context of the question is the assertion that somehow there is no carbon pricing in Canada, which is simply untrue. The Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Quebec already have carbon taxes. We did not hear any mention of that and of course we do not hear any mention of those states in the United States which are putting in place carbon pricing. This is what I meant before when I said they live in a post-fact world. They simply try to ignore the basic facts when it comes to any issue, because what they want to do is to simply play politics, deny the science, deny the facts. We see that on display in here time and time again. Alberta also has a form of carbon price. As I said before, Quebec does as well, and we have California, in its own right the eighth-largest economy in the world, with carbon pricing.                 But what does all this come back to? What all this comes back to is that that side at the moment happens to be dominated by climate change sceptics. We know the Leader of the Opposition has said he is a weathervane. We know the member for Wentworth does not agree with the opposition's approach to carbon pricing and we also know there are a number on the backbench who do not agree. But they will continue to play their basic political games. We will get on with putting in place the difficult reforms that will deliver the prosperity and jobs for the Australians of the future.

  I would like to thank the member for Moreton for his question. He is very supportive of the minerals resource rent resource tax - and why wouldn't he be? - 51,500 of his constituents are going to get their superannuation lifted courtesy of the government.                 Indeed, this government does believe in small business. We understand that small business is about people. We understand that small business wants to be able to have the time on Sunday to be with their families rather than filling in forms. The Prime Minister of Australia said on 16 September that she understood that owning a small business, the aspiration of being your own boss, is part of the Australian DNA. Indeed, we understand on this side of the House that small business provided 190,000 jobs during the global financial crisis between June 2009 and June 2010.                     Of course, it is not just our words which we have for evidence of our support for small business; we have some hard evidence, and it is called the minerals resource rent tax. What a ripper for small business. What unreservedly good news, because there is only one side of Australian politics which wants to lower their tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. There is only one side of Australian politics which wants to help 2.7 million small businesses. We want to give them a $1 billion tax break. We are the ones with the ideas to help small business. Indeed, we also want to make sure that the motor vehicle write-off for small business -                      There is another $5K for small business there - every small business. If you buy that $33,000 ute and the MRRT gets passed, there is $1,275 back in your pocket, helping small business.                 I am asked: what are the challenges to small business? Two challenges come to mind as I look across at the opposition. One of the challenges to small business is the opposition. Never in the history of the Australian Federation would I have imagined a situation where, while the mining companies are willing to pay the tax, there is only one group in Australia which wants to give $11 billion back to the miners, and that is those opposite. This crowd opposite would watch the film Robin Hood and back the Sheriff of Nottingham. But there is another threat.                     I see that arrow struck home! There is another threat to small business. It is the threat of unpredictable, disproportionate, precipitate, rogue industrial action. That is always a threat to small business -                      The member for Fadden has a lot to say for himself. I wish they would give him a question.                     As the Minister for Tourism said, there are many small businesses in tourism, and what a terrible weekend they had courtesy of the rogue action and the lockout by Qantas. The Accommodation Association of Australia has reported $10 million lost - the cancelled rooms, the conferences, the travel and the pre-existing staff rosters which have to be honoured. But it is not just tourism. Queensland and Australia lost $1.4 billion in tourism in the first quarter of this year. Just as they are getting over that hump, struggling back, they get a Qantas made tsunami of economic disorder rained upon them. How can small business cope when the national carrier is locking out its staff?                 I think the best summary of the challenges to small business comes from none other than Ita Buttrose. She tweeted: 'I'm very disappointed in the Qantas board and its chairman.'

  With all of the big issues that are around at the moment - we have a meltdown in the European economy, potentially; we have a very big and important discussion about resource rent taxation; we have huge challenges when it comes to skills; we have, or should have, a big economic debate - all those opposite can concentrate on is muckraking from a newspaper which has its own motives. I do not think anyone on our side of politics would be at all surprised by anything that was written about politics in the Daily Telegraph. They are running their own agenda; they have their own motives - and that is entirely a matter for them.                 But we on this side of the House get on with dealing with the big issues that matter to Australia. That is what we are doing, and we are doing that in a way which is making sure that we strengthen the fundamentals of our economy, whilst those opposite simply mouth empty rhetoric - not a clue about policy or future directions in our country. We are getting on with the job of governing Australia for the future.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question and look forward to being back in the Illawarra next Friday, where we will be opening the SMART infrastructure unit at Wollongong University. Indeed, we have committed some $22 billion into regional Australia in infrastructure - $22 billion from the Nation Building Program.                 But we want to do more. That is why we have established the Regional Infrastructure Fund: to use the resources from the MRRT to invest into regional Australia and to make a difference on the big productivity agenda, in rail, in roads and in ports that are impacted by the mineral boom. Indeed, we have already announced eight projects, including the Blacksoil Interchange in the electorate of the member for Oxley. Work has already commenced on this project. The Mackay ring road study; the Scone level crossing study in the electorate of Hunter - once again, work has already commenced on these studies in cooperation with state governments. The Gladstone port access road, Townsville ring road, Peak Downs Highway, the intersection of the Bruce and Capricorn highways and Gateway WA - all of these projects boosting productivity and making a difference to our national economy.                 But they are only possible if you have revenue from somewhere. Should it come from ordinary taxpayers or should it come from the resources that are all of Australia's property?                 We on this side think all Australians should benefit. Those on that side think the big miners alone should benefit. Those opposite will always side with the big end of town against working families. We have seen it this week on the MRRT, as we saw it with the Qantas dispute. They oppose ordinary Australians sharing in a fair return from the nation's resources at a time of record mining profits, even though this will lead to lower taxation for companies, higher levels of infrastructure investment and higher superannuation for workers.                 But when it comes to the debate, you have to look for consistency. I saw a fascinating quote from September. One of the leading advocates of a political party in this place said:                 I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade and how little state governments return of the massive royalty incomes they receive to the communities.                     That is the quote, talking about invading areas -                      talking about the little return from state governments of the 'massive royalty incomes' to the communities that produce this wealth, and stating how disappointed this person was about 'how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade'.                      Do you know who it was? It was the Leader of the National Party speaking about the 'invasion'. Look at the Blackberry, Warren. He goes out there and says this to one audience - this is what they say in communities - but in here, where they have a chance to make a difference, they support the 'invasion', as he called it, of mining companies.                    The member for Canning then left the chamber.

  All the evidence shows that it did not provide an effective deterrent. That is why we need a regional solution. We take our advice from the same people who advised the previous government. They have advised us that what we need at the moment to break the people smugglers' model is a regional solution, and we want to proceed - and are determined to do so. That is why those people opposite should put the national interest first and join with us in supporting a regional solution.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. A couple of months ago I was invited to a birthday party for a lady called Mavis who turned 100.                     Yes, it is somewhat of a change of pace. I thought I would tell the House about some impressions I got from that. The first was that when Mavis was born 100 years ago the average man died at 55 in Australia and the average woman died at 57. In the space of Mavis's lifetime - albeit a pretty long lifetime - Australia had added 25 years of life expectancy. That is a phenomenon not unique to Australia but one which the World Health Organisation has described as one of humanity's greatest triumphs.                 Our challenge now is to make sure that, as far as possible, those additional 25 years are good years, years during which Australians live healthy, active and connected lives. One of the most effective ways of achieving all three of those objectives is through the opportunity to work - an opportunity that will be of increasing importance to the broader national economy. As the oldest of the baby boomers turns 65 this year, we confront a situation for the first time in memory where more Australians will be leaving the workforce than joining it and where it will only be immigration that will prevent our workforce in Australia from actually shrinking.                 Our problem is that older Australians constantly describe barriers and discrimination which prevent them from staying in work or engaging in encore careers. We are advised that there are two million older Australians outside the workforce who are willing to work; that one in three Australians over 65 will not look for work and will not look for more hours because they think employers regard them as simply too old; and that three in five workers who face mandatory retirement say that they would like to keep working - at the same time that we know, literally, that grey is gold. The Human Rights Commission told us this year that older workers are worth almost $2,000 per year more than other workers because of things like lower absenteeism and increased retention rates. As this House knows, this government is acting on all of these issues. The improved work bonus introduced this year by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs allows pensioners to keep more of their wage and more of their pension if they take up the opportunity to work and to bank that entitlement for fully 12 months. Initiatives led by my South Australian colleague the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare are providing more support and more training for older workers through things like More Help for Mature Age Workers and Experience Plus. The Attorney-General has delivered on our election commitment to establish the first stand-alone Age Discrimination Commissioner, a position that will particularly focus on the workplace.                   The Treasurer - the Acting Prime Minister today - has established an Advisory Panel on the Economic Potential of Senior Australians that will explore other elements of these questions. The panel's second report focuses on the four pillars of positive ageing: health, housing, lifelong learning and participation. The report describes a myriad of other barriers that older Australians confront when trying to stay in the workplace, including financial issues like equitable access to superannuation. I am very pleased to say that, literally at the same time I was receiving the second report from Everald Compton and his panel, the Assistant Treasurer was at this very dispatch box announcing that this government will do just that as part of the MRRT package - just one more way in which this government, across portfolios, is acting to support older Australians to lead a healthy, active and connected life. We see in their opposition to the MRRT package just one more way in which the opposition are opposing it.

  There are many in this House, on both sides, that share the objective of doing something fundamental about problem gambling, which is why we have gone down the road, over a four-year period, of a Productivity Commission inquiry into the issue of problem gambling. That is why we have come to a situation where we have a commitment to mandatory precommitment technology. You can be a supporter of the club industry and have a commitment to mandatory precommitment. I have been a supporter of the club industry for a long period of time, and I dare say that in the future I will be a supporter for a long period of time as well. But it is no secret that there is a faction within the club industry that is opposed to mandatory precommitment and they are prosecuting their case with vigour, as is their democratic right. But these matters will be brought to a conclusion. We are working our way through these issues with the industry and with the crossbench. We will continue to do that. We on this side of the House are determined to do something about problem gambling because it destroys lives and it is not good for communities. Something must be done.

  I thank the member for Hunter for his ongoing interest in the mining industry of Australia, particularly in his own region. Of course, we are experiencing a mining boom in this country unprecedented in 140 years - the highest terms of trade and the highest mineral prices - and it is firmly the conviction of the Labor government that the benefits of the mining boom should be fairly spread so that it is not only the mining industry and their direct employees who benefit but the wider community. That is the philosophy that underlies the idea of a profits based tax on the mining industry. Indeed, as trade minister I can report that last month Australia recorded its second largest trade surplus, and this was built on the back of a resurgence in mining exports as a result of the resumption of exports, particularly in Queensland, following the devastating weather conditions and floods earlier in the year.                 So that is very good news, but I note that there have been suggestions to the contrary - that mining in this country is doomed. Of course, the opposition leader said that the mining tax is 'almost guaranteed to kill the mining boom stone dead'. This is the prophecy of the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, we know that, rather than the mining industry being killed stone dead, there is in fact a massive pipeline of investment of $430 billion. These are huge numbers - an unprecedented mining boom.                 But, of course, the economics of a profits based tax are far better than royalties that are levied on either the volume or value of production, because those royalties can actually deter mineral development and the full export of the mineral wealth of this country. So the royalties themselves are a deterrent, but a profits based tax is not. Yet again we have from the Leader of the Opposition no concern whatsoever about states increasing those royalties that do have an adverse effect on the mining industry and our mineral development. The opposition leader said:                 _ if people feel that the mining industry is under-taxed, there's nothing to stop the states increasing royalties _                 So he thinks it is fine for the states to increase royalties. But the truth is that the same opposition leader does not believe that the mining industry is undertaxed; he believes that it is overtaxed - that the mining industry already pays more than its fair share of tax. Again we are seeing the opposition - the coalition - always going in to bat for the few at the expense of the many. What we are seeking to do is dedicate the revenue from the mining tax to providing increased superannuation for working Australians; 8.4 million working Australians would get the benefit of an increase in superannuation and, of course, 2.7 million small businesses would get the benefit of the immediate write-off of assets valued up to $6,500. So here we are, in the week when we are introducing the mining tax, with the Leader of the Opposition always siding with the few. The once great party that says it stands for small business is absolutely against small business because it does not want them to get a tax break. The party that says it is for the workers, and says it is for the steel industry, votes against the steel industry plan and then says that the working people of this country do not deserve an increase in superannuation. We have two frontbenchers saying, 'Absolutely, that is right, they do not deserve an increase in superannuation.' It will always be Labor that sides with the many against the few in this country.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. In the hubbub, I did not hear the last bit of it, so I will attempt as best I can to respond to the question that she raises. The House may be surprised to know that the question of poker machines in general and mandatory precommitment was not a huge subject at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. In bilateral conversations with the British Foreign Secretary, the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, the foreign minister of South Africa and the foreign minister of India, this was not at the top of the agenda in the normal work that one does as a foreign minister. In fact, there were other priorities on the agenda of foreign ministers in Perth - this was not one of them. I appreciate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised this question about international travel because we are about to have a distinguished guest in Australia within two weeks.                     I do note the Deputy Leader of the Opposition required me to be relevant to that part of her question. I would simply say that her question was of a broader nature and it referred also to international travel. But, when we are speaking about international statesmen of the type that we were meeting in Perth recently, we should also reflect on the comments of another international statesman - namely, Senator Barnaby Joyce, who has said most recently.                  To be honest, I think I'm on the wrong side of the debate in the Coalition on this one.                 Lots of solidarity from Senator Joyce as far as opposition policy is concerned. But I refer to our important guest in this chamber within a week or two. That, of course, is the President of the United States. I think that, foreign policy having been raised here, it is important to remember that, first, the former Prime Minister Mr Howard described the election of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, as a victory for terrorism. Secondly, the current Leader of the Opposition said:                 He sounds terrific but I don't know what's really there.                 Thirdly, the disgraceful manner in which the member for Sturt conducted himself earlier today on a simple procedural motion - inviting the House to assemble in a week or two - underlines fundamentally where those opposite stand on foreign policy priorities. Finally, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interested in international practice, I note recently that they have gone very quiet on the question of what is actually unfolding in Norway. But that is a matter for her.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. We on this side of the House will always stand up for hardworking Australians. That went to the core of the actions that we took during the global financial crisis and the global recession. We understand the dignity of work. We understand the importance of having a job and job security. We understand the importance of families having access to affordable health, education and housing. That goes to the very core of the beliefs of all of those on this side of the House in the Labor Party, because we understand that when work is taken away, when unemployment becomes high, it not only destroys the individual but also destroys community.                 That is why at the height of the global financial crisis we moved to put in place very substantial stimulus to support the employment of families and to keep the doors of small business open, because we understood the destruction that would be experienced here if we did not do that. We have seen the destruction that has taken place in economies around the world where it was not done. I mentioned before that unemployment globally is around 200 million, but here in Australia unemployment is just above five per cent. It is double that right throughout Europe and almost double that in the United States. What drives us on this side of the House is jobs and also the capacity to work with fair working conditions. That is why we do need the Fair Work Act. We need to support those people at work with fair working conditions, and we need to back up their families with access to affordable health and education. And all of that is built on having a strict fiscal policy, because you cannot achieve those objectives of supporting employment unless you have a good, strict budget policy.                 That is what we on this side of the House have done; we have brought the budget back to surplus well before just about any other developed economy. But we also understand that you need to build people up. That is why we are investing in skills and education. Those on the other side of the House want to tear people down. They do not have the same commitment to investing in skills and education, and we know that they certainly do not have a commitment to a fair industrial relations system. They will always side with the vested interests against the interests of the broad mass of the community.                 They opposed our stimulus. Had they been in power, unemployment would be far higher now, and the social destruction from that would have been still blighting too many of our communities. As we go through this period of global volatility, we understand again that we have to engage not just domestically but internationally. We saw in the House today the lack of knowledge and the lack of comprehension of what needs to be done in the global economy. They demonstrated yet again how dangerous they would be if they were in power in these volatile conditions. They demonstrated yet again that they do not understand the international economy and that they do not understand the basis of the Australian economy.                 Those are the fundamental differences between us on this side of the House and those on that side of the House. They always stand up for vested interests. We have seen it in the carbon price debate, we have seen it in the resource rent debate and we have seen in the industrial relations debate. We on this side of the House stand for ordinary hardworking Australians who expect nothing other than a fair go, a job, and fair health, education and housing systems. That is why we are all proud to be Labor.                     He can jump at any time, Tony.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: he should stop misrepresenting the facts of this to the Australian people. The assertions he has just made about the Treasury modelling are wholly wrong. They are wholly wrong and the opposition should know that they are wholly wrong because they received detailed briefings at Senate estimates. So, before they make these claims, they should actually go out and acknowledge to the people of Australia that this is a misrepresentation when they are in possession of the facts. It is simply wrong to suggest that the Treasury modelling of the government's Clean Energy Future program depends on the United States putting a price on carbon by 2016. It is wholly wrong and the opposition is out there misleading again.                 The two key assumptions about international action in the Treasury modelling - and the Leader of the Opposition, if he were not addicted to negativity and saying no, would acknowledge this to the Australian people - are, first, that companies meet their low-end pollution reduction targets for 2010 - something verified in respect of the United States by President Obama when he spoke in this parliament late last week. The second assumption about international action is that countries have access to international abatement; and, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, there are carbon markets in operation now that Australia's scheme can link with internationally, including in the European Union.                 The assumption in the Leader of the Opposition's question is wholly wrong. This is what happens when you have no policy and you are simply addicted to saying no.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. We have in the last period seen Australia represented at four major international summits. Indeed, Australia was the only country to be a member at all four: a member at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held so successfully in Perth; a member of the G20 with the meeting held recently in France; a member of APEC, with a proud track record of support for APEC, with the meeting in Hawaii; and then, of course, the East Asia Summit held in Indonesia over the past weekend. It is only Australia that has been a member country at all four international meetings.                 I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question about how Australia's interests have been advanced at these four summits. Whilst these four summits have been of different organisations with different members and different mandates in different places, there have been some cross-cutting themes. Most particularly in this parliament I would point to concern about the global economy and a focus on the current eurozone crisis. Across all four meetings leaders expressed that they were concerned about the circumstances of the global economy and what the eurozone crisis might mean for its future.                 What was incredibly striking at all of these meetings was the difference between the circumstances of the Australian economy and the economies of so many nations around the world. It is all about jobs. It is all about this nation and this government having done what it needed to do during the global financial crisis to keep Australians working and being focused now on keeping Australians in jobs.                 When we compare our economy to the economies around the world what we see is, by the standards of the world, low unemployment. Indeed, there are major economies battling unemployment rates that are double ours. We see strong public finances and low debt. We see a strong banking sector and, of course, we see strong prospects for growth because we are in the region of the world that is continuing to grow.                  That has been reinforced at APEC and at the East Asia summit on the weekend: that this is the region of the world in this Asian century that the world is looking to be the source of economic growth. What this reinforces is the need in this Asian century to make sure - just as we managed the economy in the interests of working people during the global financial crisis - that we continue to manage it in their interests now. That does mean more appropriately taxing that sector of the economy which is racing ahead, which is turbo-charged, our mining sector, through the minerals resource rent tax and using that to spread opportunity to all around the nation so that we see people having the benefit of jobs, whether they are in small businesses, whether they are in manufacturing businesses, whether they are in retail businesses, whether they are in the services sector - that we can see Australians throughout our nation having the benefits of opportunity and jobs. That is what the minerals resource rent tax is about: the economy we want for the future where Australians throughout the nation enjoy the opportunity of getting a job.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. First and foremost, I would caution the Leader of the National Party against misrepresenting the modelling from the Centre for International Economics the way that the Leader of the Opposition commenced question time today by misrepresenting the Treasury modelling. I do understand that, when you have got no policies and you are addicted to negativity, you need to do these things, but I would caution the Leader of the National Party against it. What is very clear is that those opposite have been citing the Centre for International Economics study to support their claims about lack of US action. That claim has been repudiated by the Executive Director of the Centre for International Economics, David Pearce.                      They never like it when facts are on the table, but these are his words:                   Our modelling had nothing to do with whether the US had a carbon price. It did not test the impact of the US being in or out of the market.                 The very modelling that Leader of the National Party refers to is modelling that has been misrepresented in the public domain by those opposite.                 On the question of compensation for Australian families, what the Leader of the National Party may not understand is that for the compensation package we have Treasury modelling, which deals with the impact of electricity prices and deals with the impact therefore on CPI, uses a figure of 0.7 per cent -                      What I was saying is that Treasury has modelled this package and that modelling has been used to advise Australians that the expected price impact, the CPI impact, is 0.7 per cent. What the Leader of the National Party fails to understand is that a key part of the compensation mechanism here is the indexation of benefits that Australians receive, including family payments and the pension. Of course, CPI rises make a difference to that indexation. The Leader of the Opposition wholly fails to understand the model of carbon pricing and the opposition has been wholly misrepresenting the modelling of the Centre for International Economics. I would say again to those opposite that we have seen these claims about carbon pricing all made before. Firstly, claims about astronomical price rises are completely untrue. Then we had the Leader of the Opposition claim the coal industry was going to shut down, only to be mugged the next day by the fact that the biggest investment into a coal company in the nation's history happened and he had been standing at that mine the day before. We have seen ridiculous claims about job losses and we have seen the hypocrisy of the opposition refusing to support the jobs of steelworkers. We have seen false claim after false claim after false claim, and it is clear from the first two questions from the opposition today that the false claims will continue, because the opposition is absolutely locked in a mode of just saying no.

  I thank the member for Robertson for this very important question because later this week all members of the House will have an opportunity to spread the benefits of the mining boom to every corner of our great country. Then we will see who is prepared to stand up for the struggling small businesses of this country: 2.7 million small businesses will be major beneficiaries - those that are not necessarily in the fast lane of the mining boom. Importantly, we will see who is prepared to stand up for eight million working Australians through increased superannuation. We will also see who is prepared to stand up for more investment, particularly in our mining communities.                 This is important right now because our mining resources, our mineral resources, can only ever be dug up once. At the moment we are getting record prices for our commodities. Commodity prices are at 140-year highs. Our terms of trade are the highest they have ever been. This is the case despite the fact that there are challenging economic times in Europe and in the United States. Our mining industry is still going well. It is going well because of growth in Asia in the Asian century. That is why we are getting record prices and it is why we must take this once-in-a-generation opportunity to move some of those profits and spread them right across our country, so it means that all Australians can benefit with a fairer return from the mining boom.                 It is an economic reform which requires this country to face up to our realities. Those realities are that we must ensure that those very profitable companies who are mining our mineral resources, which we own 100 per cent, give a fair return to the Australian taxpayer. That is exactly what we are doing. I would like to thank those members of the minor parties and crossbenchers and Independents who are prepared to support this very important reform: tax breaks which will go to the benefit of 20,000 small businesses in New England, in the electorate of Lyne, in the electorate of Robertson and in all of the electorates represented by us. We are prepared to get in there and back small business; those opposite are not. But most importantly we are prepared to stand up for working Australians by boosting their superannuation, recognising that through their hard work through their working lives they are entitled to a dignified retirement.                  We on this side of the House understand that. As the architects of our retirement income system, we understand the importance of giving people dignity in retirement. We also understand the importance of increasing national savings. Our superannuation pool was critical to refunding our companies during the global financial crisis and the global recession. Building our national savings is part of having a prosperous economy. All of those opposite who are going to vote against the MRRT are voting for higher taxes for small business and lower retirement benefits for Australian workers. That is what they are voting for.                 This is a very important day in the history of economic reform in our country, economic reform to increase prosperity. Those opposite can only say no. They do not have one positive idea for the future. All they have is brain snaps and backflips. All they can do is say no; they have no positive ideas.

  I confirm again to the parliament and to the Leader of the Opposition the information that was made available to the opposition through Senate estimates and that it should know. That information is that the Treasury modelling assumes that nations hold to the lower end of their pledges for reducing carbon pollution.                  This moment very much reminds me of when the Leader of the Opposition got himself in a huge mess when he was out and about at a public meeting describing Australia's minus-five-per-cent target as 'crazy', whereas at the same time his blogs - I think on Mamamia - praised the fact that the Liberal opposition actually had bipartisan support for that target. Of course, that minus-five-per-cent target is what Australia has pledged it will do by 2020. My understanding, unless something has happened this morning, is that that is supported by the Leader of the Opposition. What is being done in the Treasury modelling -                  The modelling assumes comparable carbon pricing in other major economies from 2015-16 _                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I went to Australia's reduction target for 2020 to give the parliament and the Leader of the Opposition an example of a nation - Australia - that has made an unconditional pledge to reduce its carbon pollution. We have made an unconditional pledge to reduce our carbon pollution by five per cent.                 What the Treasury modelling does is assume that other countries meet their low-end pollution reduction targets for 2020 as well. The opposition knows that when it is not on a campaign of misrepresentation. That has been gone through at Senate estimates. That is a fact available to the opposition. In terms of the position of the United States of America, it was verified by President Obama in this parliament last Thursday when he restated the commitment of the United States of America to the reduction target that it has announced.                 The Leader of the Opposition, I understand, is trying to do everything he can to continue his campaign of negativity, but he cannot live in denial of the facts, and the facts are as I have just explained them to the Leader of the Opposition. For him to say anything else or to do anything else is simply to mislead the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I also thank him for his consideration of the minerals resource rent tax and for his understanding of the shape of Australia's economy today and the great potentials which lie in the future for our country. Realising those potentials means that we need to better tax the area of the economy which is turbocharged and to share those benefits with other areas of the economy, but it also means that we need to address important questions about how we are going to work through issues associated with water, soil and food, with coal seam gas and with major coal projects, and also how we are dealing with the tax work which was spoken about at the recent tax forum, including concerns about royalty increases by state governments.                 To go quickly through those areas, as I indicated to Labor members who raised with me community concerns in their own area about coal seam gas and large-scale coalmining, coal seam gas is going to be an important fuel for our future. What we can do as a federal government is value-add in our traditional roles of scientific leadership, coordinating the states and driving them to best practice, and that is what the government has agreed to do: to ensure that there is a well-resourced scientific body that can make the right assessments of Australia's land so that that dataset is available to everyone, including local communities, and a national partnership so we drive state governments up to coordinated best-practice standards. Local communities are empowered along the way, because that scientific information will be in their hands too. I think that that is an important development and one that has been the subject of intense discussion with the members for New England and Lyne and is a value-add to what the Commonwealth has traditionally done in these areas of planning.                 In addition, the member for Lyne has raised with me how we can ensure that across our nation our water, soil and food production for the future is in the right balance. With this being the Asian century, we have huge opportunities in front of us for food production. We are seeing the rise of middle classes in Asia to more than a billion people by the end of 2020, and they will want what we have - that is, they will want high-quality, clean, green food; they will want to buy premium wine; and they will also want to go to parts of Australia that have retained their natural beauty and be able to come here for tourism purposes. That does require us to make sure that we work in balance across those areas, and the government has agreed to create a cabinet-level working group on water, soil and food. We have agreed that the members for Lyne and New England will participate in that working group, and I thank them for their agreement to do that.                 Finally, the member for Lyne has been a long-time advocate for dealing with the question of inefficient state taxes. He has raised directly the question of state royalties and, in light of the MRRT, the government believes that that should be looked by the John Brumby-Nick Greiner review which is working in the area of GST reform. So I thank the member who asked the question and also the member for New England for their support and for understanding today's economy and the future for Australia.

  I want to thank the member for Hunter for the question. He is someone who has a significant resources industry within his electorate and is a strong supporter of jobs but also wants to make sure that we get the balance right.                 The coal seam gas discussions that have been happening throughout the community and indeed throughout the parliament as well have brought very much to our attention the issues and the complexity of dealing with underground water. In the extraction of coal seam gas, large amounts of water are removed from aquifers. In circumstances where those aquifers do not have connection to the rest of the underground water, there is not necessarily a problem, but in circumstances where there is connectivity there can be very significant outcomes not only for environmental assets but also for agriculture.                 There is a need for any scientific assessment of this to be part of environmental approvals, as has been the case at a federal level. There is also a need for that scientific assessment to be independent, and completely independent, of the other funding resources. People have often questioned whether or not, for something as significant as the water table, we should have a situation where the companies, for example, are the sole providers of the scientific research. That is why the government announced today that the standards we have been applying will actually be able to be applied nationally now through an independent expert scientific committee. It will be able to look at coal seam gas, it will be able to look at large-scale coalmining developments and it will, importantly, in doing so, be able to look at the protection of our water resources.                 It is critical to remember that the federal approvals which have been given, which call for things like reinjection and which call for principles like re-pressurisation, are only able to apply to the extent that we activate Matters of National Environmental Significance. A number of members have pointed to this as a significant limitation. This is a well-resourced committee with $150 million behind it to be able to make sure that the science is understood on the connectivity between these aquifers and the rest of underground water. It not only will look at that to the extent that we have national environmental powers but will be able to look at water issues generally.                 We then need to make sure that the states are willing to incorporate the work of this committee into their own environmental approvals. A national partnership agreement will be pursued with the states, with $50 million on the table for incentive payments to make sure that the states are willing to incorporate the best-quality scientific information made available through this committee into their own environmental approvals. By doing it this way, we manage to avoid the significant red-tape challenges that would be there by having a unilateral federal takeover of state approvals, so you do not get the extra layers of red tape but you do get the best-quality science. You do get the best-quality protection of underground water. You do make sure that the interests of the environment and the interests of agriculture are properly taken into account through working with the states and making sure that we have the best possible quality scientific information, made by a committee that is well-resourced and operating entirely independently of the mining companies themselves.

  On the issue of modelling, it is simply wrong to suggest, as the coalition has been suggesting, that the government's Clean Energy Future plan somehow relies upon an economy wide cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme in the United States. We have heard this being implemented by 2016 and we have heard it repeated here in question time.                 Let me make something clear about the Treasury modelling. The Treasury modelling makes two key assumptions about international action: firstly, that countries meet the low-end pollution reduction targets for 2020 that they committed to under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The second important assumption is that countries have access to international abatement - countries including Australia having access to international carbon markets. Those are the two important assumptions that underpin the Treasury modelling. They are both completely reasonable assumptions. Nothing -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is important, of course, to establish the basis for the Treasury modelling that the coalition have been consistently representing. On the issue of the United States, nothing President Obama said during his visit to Australia calls those issues into question whatsoever. In fact, the contrary is the case. It needs to be made clear that President Obama in fact confirmed the commitment of the United States to meet its emissions reductions targets.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The opposition are well aware of the things that I am adverting to in relation to the Treasury modelling. In fact, they have had detailed briefings at Senate estimates and yet they still persist with these claims. In testimony to the Senate, senior Treasury officials from the modelling team stated a number of things. These I quote. Treasury assumes:                 _ that countries that have made pledges at either Cancun or Copenhagen conventions through the UNFCCC process implement policies to achieve those pledges.                 That is the assumption. Furthermore:                 What we are assuming is that there are mechanisms in countries _ that result in an implicit or explicit carbon price -                      Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is relevant, as will be apparent if I am allowed to get to the end of the answer. The Treasury officials also went on to say, in relation to the assumptions:                 It does not mean it specifically has to be an emissions trading scheme within all countries _ we are assuming that there is a continuation of the international offset market which exists now _                 This is entirely relevant to the issue in question, because I went on to say in The 7.30 Report that it involves access to international carbon markets.                     That is what the record of the interview will show clearly, and the assumptions that the Treasury make in relation to the modelling are entirely apparent. They involve access to carbon markets and Australian businesses, when we go to a flexible emissions trading scheme from 1 July 2015, will be able to access those markets in order to meet the emissions reductions target.                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Cunningham for the question. In doing so, I remind the House that this week we must finally determine whether we as a community are prepared to support a tax that the mining industry now supports. In doing so, this House has an opportunity to share the benefits of the resources boom that Australia is currently experiencing. The coalition, in their determination to vote down this tax, have to face up to the fact that they are voting against taxation relief for small business. I must say that that is very important to a broad section of small businesses in the Australian community. They must also face up to the fact that they are voting against the opportunity for small business to have an automatic capital write-off of $6,500. As Minister for Tourism, I remind the House that that is exceptionally important to the almost 280,000 enterprises in the tourism sector. It is also about making sure that where we are experiencing the pressures of the resources boom in the key petroleum areas, we have the capacity to invest in infrastructure and, in doing so, to ensure Australia's opportunity to grasp every available increase with respect to export opportunities.                 In terms of this debate, I notice that the opposition were out there yesterday reinforcing their determination to vote down this tax. But when questioned about the alternative, they basically said, 'We have a smarter opportunity, and that is to increase royalties.' In essence they said: when it comes to the MRRT there is sovereign risk but not with respect to the opportunities of state premiers and treasurers to increase royalties willy-nilly. When it comes to assisting small- and medium-sized businesses, they say the MRRT is wrong, but increases in royalties do not impact on small- and medium-sized businesses. They also say that, in essence, state royalties represent a better opportunity in terms of increasing taxation in Australia. That is contrary to the view of the mining industry, who very firmly believe that profits based tax system is the best system for the mining industry. The mining industry have said in no uncertain terms that in times of high commodity prices they are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and share the benefits of the resources boom with the whole of the Australian community.                 There is no risk to investment in Australia. The facts speak for themselves. We have a planned and committed capital investment pipeline of $430 billion. In the resources and energy sector alone, ABARE and BRS reported earlier this year that there were 94 projects in an advanced stage of development, with a record capital expenditure of $173.5 billion - a 31 per cent increase from October this year through to April. The report then talks about recent decisions: Olympic Dam - a potential $30 billion investment - the biggest open-cut mine in the world. There is the Wheatstone project with a recent investment of $29 billion.                 The time has come for this parliament to determine once and for all whether or not it is prepared to support the MRRT, which the mining industry largely supports, and in doing so to spread the benefits or yet again see further displays of hypocrisy. Royalties affect and hurt small- and medium-sized businesses. An increase in royalties represents a real sovereign risk issue because they are retrospective in nature.

  To the member for Indi I say: the campaign of misrepresentation continues. What the member for Indi should know is that our steelmaking industry has been under intense pressure. Labor members in this parliament know that because we are deeply concerned about Australian manufacturing and steel making. It has been under intense pressure because of the transformation in our economy that is arising from the Asian century.                 It has been under pressure because of the high demand for the minerals that we sell, because our economy emerged strongly from the global financial crisis and because this government, working with the people of Australia - with employers and with unions - ensured that we had Australian jobs. Because of the commodities prices we are seeing, the growth in the resources sector and Australia's status as a safe place, we are seeing strong dollar prices. Those strong dollar prices put pressure on industries like steelmaking. That changes the equation for people who are going to buy that steel from overseas and it changes the equation in relation to import replacements. The attitude of the government in relation to steelmaking has therefore been to work in partnership with them, and that is why we designed the Steel Transformation Plan.                 It is very interesting indeed that the member who came to the dispatch box and feigned concerned for working people in Whyalla voted against a $300 million package to help steelworkers. We always knew this concern was feigned - when the Leader of the Opposition went through manufacturing establishments and went to steelmaking establishments - because the Liberal Party never once in their entire life have ever stood by working people in manufacturing. This Liberal opposition are showing their contempt for working people in manufacturing through their half-a-billion-dollar cut to the assistance that supports the car industry.                 We have stood shoulder to shoulder with manufacturing workers, including workers in the steel industry. That is why we designed a $300 million plan. That is why we came into this parliament and voted for it. That is why we will always do what we need to do to support Australian jobs, despite the relentless negativity of the opposition. They did not support jobs during the global financial crisis, they do not support manufacturing today and they want to cut half a billion dollars out of assistance to the car industry. Every member on that side of the House is on record showing their contempt for steelworkers by coming into this parliament and voting against their jobs.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. Indeed, today we have announced more than $200 million brought forward to this financial year to fast-track our regional infrastructure development in Queensland alone. That is money brought forward for the Cairns southern approach on the Bruce Highway, for the Calliope Crossroads, for the Yeppen roundabout and bridge upgrade in the electorate of Capricornia and, importantly for the member for Blair, for construction on the Blacksoil interchange of the Warrego Highway. This is a critical program funded by the Regional Infrastructure Fund. It is related to the billions of dollars of resource developments that are taking place in the Surat Basin. Nationwide we have more than doubled regional infrastructure funding to some $22 billion.                     The morons opposite yell out, 'What a rort.'                     I withdraw, Mr Speaker. We are funding the Mackay ring road study. Let it be said that -                      Well, when you do an infrastructure project, first you plan it - and there was none done by those opposite; they are on the record as opposing it. The fact is that the government says yes, the community says yes, and even the big miners say yes to the Regional Infrastructure Fund, but the walking vuvuzela and his team over there say no. They say no to completing the Townsville ring road; they say no to the Mackay ring road; they say no to upgrading the intersection between the Bruce and Capricorn highways; they say no to the Gladstone Port access road -                      They say no to upgrading the Peak Downs Highway. They say no to all these projects. At the same time, the leader of the Nats, while in regional Australia, said:                 I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade -                  'Invade' was the term used -                  and how little state governments return the massive royalty incomes they receive to these communities.                 That is what they say out there in their communities, but in here the Nats line up with their Liberal Party colleagues to knock over funding for regional infrastructure.                 There are some regional members who understand the importance of regional infrastructure and they sit on this side and up in the corner over there - the member for Lyne, the member for New England. They understand the importance of regional infrastructure and that is why they are backing the MRRT.                   I must say there are some others who understand as well. Remember in the budget when we brought forward an additional $1.02 billion for the Pacific Highway? Those opposite, including the local member, said that it was a mirage - that there would be nothing built and that it was just for planning. Well, last week, I was there with the leader of the New South Wales Nats, Andrew Stoner, announcing the construction of the Clybucca section of the Pacific Highway. This is the location of the worst road accident in Australia's history. They did nothing about it for 12 years. We have brought forward funding. Construction will commence in 2012 as part of our upgrade of the Pacific Highway. I pay tribute to the member for Lyne, particularly for the work that he has done in advocating the upgrade of the Pacific Highway, unlike the member for Cowper who has been opposed to funding in his own electorate.

  He has got a lot of nerve and a lot of hide to ask that question. He has got one fact right and one only: there is $11 billion worth of revenue in the forward estimates - that is absolutely correct - but, of course, he has pointed to the fact there have been some royalty increases in Western Australia that will have an impact on revenues, and we will account for that in the mid-year economic review when it is published before the end of the year.                 Regarding the attempted increase in royalties by New South Wales, there is yet no royalty increase in New South Wales. There is yet no figure provided by New South Wales.                     They did put it in their numbers, but they have not told us what they are going to do. If you accept that then you believe in the tooth fairy. There is no figure that can be validly put in any calculation, but the one thing you can be absolutely sure that we will do on this side of the House is that we will put in place fiscal responsibility because we are determined to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13, despite the fact there has been a significant hit to revenues from events that have occurred in Europe and the United States. There has been a flow-on effect, but we understand the importance of having a clear and consistent fiscal policy, particularly at a time when there is such uncertainty in the global economy. We will send a clear message to markets and to the global economy that we will manage our economy in a fiscally responsible way, and that is what we are going to do by bringing our budget back to surplus in 2012-13 and making responsible savings to do it when we bring down the mid-year review.                  We will see where they stand on fiscal responsibility because the shadow Treasurer has got a $70 billion crater in his budget bottom line and, before he takes any new policy decisions, he starts with a minus $70 billion in his budget line. All of that is on the back of the debacle of the $11 billion black hole, which was discovered by the departments of Finance and Treasury.                     Sometimes a difference of time zones causes remarkable events to happen. The Leader of the Opposition, who has talked down our economy year after year, a couple of weeks ago went to London, and you know what he said? Our economy was the envy of the world. 'Two-timing Tony' - he says one thing in Europe and another thing here when he runs down the economy every day of his life.                     Supporting jobs and good budget management is our No. 1 priority. It was our No. 1 priority when we dealt with the global financial crisis and the global recession. It remains our No. 1 priority as we set about spreading the great opportunities, which are flowing from the mining boom, to every corner of our country. The rock that that is built on is our commitment to return our budget to surplus in a responsible way with savings when we bring down the mid-year review. The challenge for those opposite is: will they support responsible budgeting and the savings that are required or not? The answer will be: no.                     Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the statement by the member for Denison just before question time that only 20 to 30 miners will be paying in full the $11 billion mining tax. Given that one of the biggest miners in Australia, Fortescue Metals, has advised its shareholders that it will not be paying any mining tax for the next three years, isn't the $11 billion of revenue from this tax just an illusion? And will the government now release all modelling details on their flawed mining tax?

  I would like to thank the member for La Trobe for her question. She understands that there will be 53,600 voters in her electorate who are going to get an increase in superannuation because of the government's mining tax. In fact, it is fair to say that the MRRT is unmistakably good news right across the Australian economy, especially for people saving for their retirement and for Australia's 2.7 million small businesses.                 And why wouldn't it be good news - nine to 12 per cent in compulsory savings and the instant right-off and tax benefits for small business totalling up to over $10,000? Why wouldn't it be good news for the Australian economy and for Australians that people earning under $37,000 will get back all of the concessional tax that they have paid on superannuation? In fact, why isn't it good news for small business and all Australians that we will see a mining tax driving productivity focused infrastructure investment in the mining states?                 But, of course, there are some here who still do not support the mining tax - which is a matter of some bemusement. Why shouldn't the Australian people get a dividend back for the hospitals they have funded that look after the workers that go in the mines? Why shouldn't the Australian people get a dividend back for the schools, the education and the training that they have provided for the workforce that makes the profits for these companies? Why shouldn't the Australian people get a dividend throughout the whole of the Australian economy - because it is their taxes that have helped fund the infrastructure which allows these mining companies to make their remarkable profits?                 Lifting superannuation is just fiscally responsible. It is good for the whole economy. As a result of us having 12 per cent compulsory retirement savings by 2030, I suspect it is likely that we will have $10 billion less to pay in age pension outlays. I believe there is no doubt that, because we have $1.3 trillion in savings, Australian enterprise will be less reliant on foreign capital.                 I am asked how it important it is to the parliament. I have looked back - as I am wont to do - to see what people in this place have said in the past, and I found an interesting quote from the member for Warringah, on 25 September 1995. Always remember that what you say comes back to haunt you. The member for Warringah said:                 Compulsory superannuation -                  wait for it; you will not believe he said it then -                  is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.                     Well, in fact, he does still believe it. When he was talking to Melbourne Talk Radio on 4 May 2010, Mr Price, the journalist, asked Mr Abbott: 'What do you think about increasing from nine to 12?' and the Leader of the Opposition said:                 I don't support this change. That is what I am saying, Steve.                 Mr Price then asked:                 So it'll stay at 9 under you?                  And Mr Abbott said:                 Yes, that's right. I am not proposing this. It isn't our policy. We are deeply sceptical ...                 Mr Price then went on to say:                 So let me get that clear - you would leave the contribution rate at 9?                 Mr Abbott:                 I have no plans to change it.                 Well, at least until 8 November this year. What a backward somersaulter this fellow is who is running the opposition.                 Those opposite are going to move their own amendments to the mining tax - fair enough - but then they are still going to vote against it. So what is the point of moving amendments? They say that they are against the 12 per cent and then they roll Andrew Robb in the opposition, and now they say that they are going to keep the 12 per cent. But, of course, what do you do when you do not support the 12 per cent? You abstain. So they have been against it and now they are going to abstain. They believe superannuation is a con job, but now he says that he wants to abstain - although there are some synonymous, if not valiant, members of the coalition secretly backgrounding the media saying that they support the mining tax. But I think the cracker is that, regardless of superannuation and regardless of the tax, they want to give $11 billion back -

  We have published in all of our budget updates and in our budgets our estimates of the revenues. And our estimates of the revenues will be updated in the Mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, which will come out before Christmas. Revenues are affected by a whole variety of factors. They are affected by exchange rates, volumes and production levels - and the list goes on. They are affected by all of those factors and those factors are evaluated when we do our forecasting. They will be updated and published before Christmas. The total revenues will be out there.                 We have made it very clear that this is a super-profits tax that will be paid by companies that are super profitable by definition. Most other companies pay company tax. Some of them do not, as we have heard. But they will eventually pay some company tax. But there are plenty of companies out there that are super-profitable and have become super-profitable because our terms of trade are at 140-year highs. We will update all of that in the mid-year economic review and it will be the case that a relatively small number of very large companies will be paying the bulk of the revenue. That is what Treasury officials told everybody at estimates.

  I thank the member for Holt for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in the Australia-United States alliance. This year, marked by President Obama's visit, we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the alliance. As President Obama said when he was here, the alliance has never been stronger. For 60 years, it has been the bedrock of our security, strategic and defence arrangements.                 The member asked me about recent developments. In terms of the operational structure of the alliance, we do not have US bases in Australia. We have joint facilities, which were effected in the late 1980s. Pine Gap is the classic and obvious example in that respect. We also have very substantial training exercises with the United States and provide access to our facilities. That is all done under a status of forces agreement that was struck in 1963. Perhaps the best example of the training that we do with the United States is Exercise Talisman Sabre, which is carried out every two years. On the last occasion, this year, we had between 14,000 and 15,000 military and defence personnel from the United States in Australia.                 The alliance has moved with the times. We saw over a decade ago the invoking of the alliance for the first occasion in the aftermath of the terrible events of 11 September 2011 in the face of international terrorism. At the AUSMIN meeting this year in San Francisco, through an accord struck by the four principles at the meeting, we agreed that, for example, a cyberattack could be an attack that would invoke the provisions of the treaty.                 The member asked by about operational and practical developments. The whole world is moving to our part of the world. It is not just the rise of China. It is also the rise of India, the exponential increase in the growth of the ASEAN economies, the ongoing importance of Japan and the Republic of Korea, the emergence of Indonesia as a global influence not just a regional influence, and the ongoing importance - economically and strategically - of the United States. As the Prime Minister made very clear during the President's visit, the ongoing engagement by the United States in the Asia-Pacific in this the Asia-Pacific century is absolutely important - indeed, not just its ongoing engagement but its enhanced engagement.                 That has been reflected by the announcements made by the Prime Minister and the President during the President's visit. Firstly, there will be a rotational group of United States marines in the Northern Territory, starting in the first and second quarters of next year with a group of 250 and growing over time to a group as large of 2,500 marines and air force personnel in 2016-17 - a taskforce group. We envisage that we will see training and exercises conducted at the Delamere weapons range, at Mount Bundy and also at Bradshaw.                 As well, as I and the Prime Minister have indicated, there is the prospect of greater utilisation of airfields in Northern Australia - in particular RAAF Base Tindal - by United States aircraft. I have also indicated that further down the track we will have ongoing consideration of allowing US surface and submarine vessels greater access to our Indian Ocean port, HMAS Stirling, Fleet Base West. This is an ongoing extension of the training and exercises that we do. At the same time, it is the single most important development in the operational arrangements under the alliance since the striking of the joint facilities in the 1980s. This is unambiguously in Australia's national interest and unambiguously in our region's interest.

  I thank the opposition for this question. Mind you, I think it takes temerity for the opposition to ask any question about consultation, as a week or so ago the Leader of the Opposition announced a $750 million policy on superannuation without bothering to consult the shadow minister for finance. So, for anyone opposite to stand up and raise any question about consultation really takes the cake. The Australian Labor Party has some rules. Our rules are that any member of the party, from the Prime Minister to your local branch president, can put forward proposals for the party's national conference. That is what the Prime Minister has done. I support her right to do so.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question, particularly on a day on which Australia has now finally passed the world's first plain-packaging legislation. I know that he has been a very keen advocate of that measure. That will save many lives in the future. I can report to the House that across the country Labor's health reforms are starting to make a very practical difference to the community. For example, I know that the member for Greenway clearly understands the benefits. The Prime Minister was in her electorate, and on the front page of the Blacktown Advocate the member was welcoming, as was the Prime Minister, that there will now be 150 medical trainees in Blacktown when six years ago there were none. Six years ago there were none and there is a capacity now for there to be 150 medical students doing their training in Blacktown, providing services into the western suburbs of Sydney where they were not able to do that before.                 I know, for example, that the member for Wannon will be delighted that the Portland GP superclinic has been on the front page of his local paper twice - two weeks in a row - because the Portland superclinic is going to provide his community and his citizens with access to special services.                 I know, for example, that the member for Robertson will be particularly delighted that the front page of her paper, the Peninsula News, reports that the new rehabilitation beds at Woy Woy Hospital will be very welcome. And I know that our friend, the member for New England, who is not in the chamber now, was delighted to turn the first sod - with a particular country flair, I think actually throwing the first sod - for the regional cancer centre which is going to be in Tamworth. I know that my colleague, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport - also interested in soil - was delighted that Stanmore Public School was getting one of the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden programs.                 I hold all these articles up to highlight to the community and to highlight to the House that across each and every electorate we have investments in health services that are delivering to the community. We have more GP registrars in training - 900 this year. When Mr Abbott was health minister, he had a cap on GP training places at 600. We now have 900, and that is going up to 1,200 providing services across the community.                 We have our GP after-hours hotline, which is now providing support and relief to families - in the middle of the night, when their GP is not open, they can call and have a GP on the end of the line to get advice. More than 50,000 Australians, many of them with young children, have taken advantage of those health services.                 Of course, we are seeing changes in our hospitals as we speak. For the first time staph infection rates in each and every hospital are being provided on the My Hospitals website. These reforms have all been opposed by those opposite. They said at the last election that they would cut funding for superclinics and for primary care infrastructure grants. They have never supported the regional cancer centres and they have said they will close down the GP after-hours line. We are getting on with the job of delivering health services that this man opposite never delivered when he was the health minister.

  I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who asked effectively the same question as he asked yesterday, that the facts do not change no matter how much he yells about them. The facts do not change no matter how many times he says no. The facts do not change no matter how relentlessly negative he is. The facts that were the facts yesterday, which we talked about in question time, are the facts today, and they will be the facts tomorrow. No amount of fear campaigning, from an opposition leader who has no policies and consequently only knows how to run fear campaigns and how to say no, will change the facts. The facts will not change just because the Leader of the Opposition is desperate for them to. The facts will not change because of that.                 The facts are the same as they were yesterday and, for members of the opposition who were too busy screaming out 'no' to listen to those facts yesterday, the facts are these: the Treasury modelling that the Leader of the Opposition refers to does not make an assumption about the United States of America having a carbon price. The international assumptions in the Treasury modelling are that countries deliver to the low end of their pledges. Australia, to use our own nation as an example, has publicly committed internationally to a minus five per cent target in 2020 unconditionally. The international modelling assumes that countries will deliver to their low-end targets.                 Then the Leader of the Opposition comes in once again with this furphy. How many times do we have to listen to this silly fear campaign - this relentless negativity? He insults people around the world who are actually acting on carbon. He insults people around the world who are dealing with carbon pollution. To remind the Leader of the Opposition: President Obama stood in this parliament and verified his clean energy target. California, which if it were a nation unto itself would be amongst the biggest economies in the world, is moving to put a price on carbon. The European Union has a price on carbon. New Zealand has a price on carbon. A number of Chinese provinces will trial a price on carbon, and so the list goes on.                 These are the facts, and no amount of twisting and turning by a Leader of the Opposition who is so desperate because he has no policies that he has nothing to say - not one word to say, not one idea in his mind except saying no - will change that. No amount of repetition of these falsehoods will turn them into truths.                 I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that some days he has gone out and said that he agrees with our minus five per cent target in 2020. He has on other days gone out and said that he is opposed to the minus five per cent target. I will make a grand assumption that today he is in favour of the minus five per cent target, and I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he is in favour of the minus five per cent target, why would he impose on Australians the most costly way of doing it? Why would he require Australian families to give him $1,300 to pursue his scheme, which he knows will not work and which will take money from Australian families and give it to big polluters? The Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign will never turn into facts, no matter how often he repeats it.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and I thank him for his continued campaigning about the interests of working families in his electorate, including their ability to have fairness and decency at work. As a Labor government we are driven by meeting the needs of working people and by ensuring that people can get the opportunity that comes with the job and that there is opportunity around the nation as we continue to create jobs - there have been more than 700,000 jobs created since the government first came to office. We worked with employers, unions and the Australian community to keep our economy strong during the global financial crisis. As a result, we kept Australians in work.                 But our depth of commitment to working Australians goes beyond the simple opportunity to have a job, as profound as that is for families and their living circumstances; it is also to make sure they enjoy fairness and decency at work. That was why we were so determined to kill Work Choices when we came to office, and we did. It was a dagger aimed at the hearts of working families when it came to the cost of living - they could have their penalty rates and overtime ripped off them - and it profoundly struck at our core belief that a fair day's work deserves a fair day's pay.                 Motivated by that core belief, we think that a fair day's pay for a fair day's work should extend to Australia's working women. That is why we have ensured the industrial relations law of this country provides a proper principle of equal pay for working women who have been denied that protection for too long. There is no better example than the people who work in domestic violence shelters, with people with disabilities, in services for the homeless and in services for the mentally ill. There are thousands of these workers in our community and three-quarters of them are women. Nearly two-thirds have an industry qualification, compared to just over one-half in other industries, but on average they get paid $12,000 less a year than the average Australian worker. I am very pleased and proud that we have been able to work with their union, the Australian Services Union, as well as employers in the sector to go to Fair Work Australia and drive to get these workers equal pay.                 In addition to getting these workers equal pay we want to make a difference to the nation's truck drivers. I think everybody knows that truck drivers work long and hard for the money that they receive. Working long and hard can sometimes mean that they end up with problems of speed, fatigue and dangerous work practices. Around 250 people are killed each year from heavy vehicle accidents and more than 1,000 people suffer injuries on the road. This industry continues to have the highest incidence of fatal injuries compared to all other industries, with 25 deaths per 100,000 workers, which is 10 times the average for all industries. We want to change that by ensuring there is a tribunal that can work with this industry so that truck drivers enjoy safe rates and Australians see safer roads. This is another Labor initiative for working Australians, who do it very tough indeed and are entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.

  I am concerned - and this is really addressed to the staff members assisting the opposition - that they have brought in their question time pack from May or June or maybe August or September. I say to the opposition: your relentless negativity -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. If we ever needed an example of the bluster and lack of substance of the opposition, we have just seen one. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who asked the question, I say the following: how dare any member of the opposition come to the dispatch box and say the words 'working families'. How dare they after their record in government. How dare they after they imposed Work Choices on working Australians. How dare they ever utter those words. How dare they when their approach to any dispute, to any policy question -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked very directly about my commitment to working families and I am answering that question. I am doing that by saying that this is a Labor government committed to the interests of working families. That is why we killed the disgusting product -                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Our commitment to working people has been demonstrated by getting rid of the hated Work Choices, beloved by the Leader of the Opposition and beloved by his deputy, and it will be back in five minutes if they ever have the opportunity to do so. Our commitment to working people has been demonstrated by the approach we took to rebuilding the nation after the summer of floods - opposed every step of the way by those opposite. Our commitment to working people has been shown by the rolling out of our health reform - opposed every step of the way by those opposite. Our commitment to working people and their prosperity and the services they need in the future is shown by rolling out the technology of the future, the NBN - opposed every step of the way by the Leader of the Opposition. Our commitment to working people is shown by our commitment to working women and equal pay, something opposed by the opposition. We have added to that commitment today with a commitment to safe rates which will inevitably be opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to working people by trebling the tax-free threshold - opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to older Australians by increasing the pension - opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to working families by increasing family payments - opposed by the Leader of the Opposition - and on and on and on the list goes.                 Let me say this: there is no amount of negativity, there is no amount of fear campaigning, that changes some very basic facts.                     This is a nation that has committed itself to cutting carbon pollution. The cheapest way to do that is through the government's scheme. The most expensive way of doing that is to do it the way the Leader of the Opposition, today, supports. This government supports putting a price that big polluters pay and putting money in the pockets of working families. The Leader of the Opposition actually supports the complete reverse, taking money out of the pockets of working families and giving it to big polluters.                 Let me conclude by saying this: all of this pretence and fear campaigning is part of a grand cover-up that the Leader of the Opposition, like every other living Liberal leader, supports putting a price on carbon pollution. It is time he gave up this fear campaigning and just said it.

  I thank the member for Fowler for this question. This is a government that is committed to looking after working families and their interests and it is indeed a tragedy that every year around 250 people are killed in accidents on our roads that involve heavy vehicles. More than a thousand people are seriously injured in accidents involving heavy vehicles on our roads. Most of those deaths involve other vehicles in a collision with trucks. That is why this is an issue for all who travel on our roads, not just for those working men and women who deliver goods right around this vast nation. The road transport sector continues to have the highest incidence of fatal injuries compared with every other industry. Some 25 deaths per 100,000 workers - 10 times the average for all industries.                 I, as the minister, commissioned a report by the National Transport Commission that found that low rates of pay can lead to risky work practices by drivers trying to make ends meet. This followed a number of reports over the years, and I acknowledge the work done by the member for Hinkler and other members of this chamber in producing reports such as the House of Representatives report Beyond the midnight oil. These reports and studies have documented the risky practices, including speeding, taking drugs, driving long hours and risking accidents by not maintaining heavy vehicles.                 This cannot continue and that is why the government will introduce legislation this week to establish a national road safety remuneration system, comprising a tribunal and a separate education and compliance framework. The tribunal will have the ability to set pay or pay-related conditions to ensure safe driving practices. The tribunal will begin work on 1 July next year and will include members from Fair Work Australia, along with independent work, health and safety experts. Truck drivers should not have to speed, overload their trucks, drive excessive hours or cut back on vehicle maintenance just to make a decent living.                 These reforms are long overdue in the trucking industry and will improve safety in the industry. They have been welcomed by many senior people in the trucking industry, including people such as Lindsay Fox, who for many, many years has been a strong advocate, to his great credit, of better practices on our roads, because he wants to look after his workforce. He understands that good work practice is also good business practice. I pay particular tribute to those people in the Transport Workers Union and in bodies such as Linfox, the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association and others who have been a part of what is a very long campaign to get this reform through.                 We established a safe rates advisory group 12 months ago and we have been consulting every step of the way. This is a good reform. It is about better practice for this nation's truck drivers, but it is also about safer roads for all Australians. I call upon the whole chamber to support this reform.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I do think that it leads people to question whether or not the opposition are still committed to reducing carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, because the Leader of the National Party seemed to be implying in his question that, given Australia's size and scale, somehow we should not be acting. If that is what the Leader of the National Party is saying that is another position from the opposition. My understanding is that they started this morning supporting the minus five per cent target for 2020. If they have moved from that then that should be made expressly clear to the Australian people.                 Assuming that they do still support a minus five per cent target, the question for our nation is: if we are going to reach that target, how should we do it and when should we start? Our answers are we should do it soon and we should do it in the cheapest way possible. We should do it by asking the biggest polluters to pay. We should do it by using that money to support Australian working families through tax cuts, many of them seeing tax cuts in the order of $300 a year, and pension increases, with many pensioners seeing that they will have more money in their pockets because the average impact on them of the flowthrough from carbon pricing is less than the amount that they will receive as an increased pension. We will do it by putting more money into the pockets of families through the family payments system. We will do it while supporting Australian jobs and we will be working with industries, like the steel industry and manufacturing, to support Australian jobs. All of these measures to support Australian jobs are opposed by the opposition.                 I say to the Leader of the National Party, he needs to ensure that he is informed about action around the world in the form of carbon pricing. This action is being taken in the European Union and in New Zealand. This action will be trialled in provinces in China. This action is happening in states in the United States, including the economy of California, which would be in the G20 if it were a nation on its own account. We are seeing places like India putting a tax on coal in order to fund clean energy development. This is what is happening around the world as people are moving to reduce carbon pollution.                 This has presented to our nation the question of how best to do it, and we have answered the question: getting the big polluters to pay and supporting working families. The Leader of the National Party either supports doing nothing - and that seems to be the implication of his question - or he supports the current stated policy of the opposition to rip money out of the hands of working families and give it to be biggest polluters. That is not right, it will not work and working families should not have to pay the $1,300 per year price tag that this Leader of the Opposition and this Leader of the National Party want to put on them.

  I thank the member for New England for his question and his preparedness to deal with issues like the minerals resource rent tax and putting a price on carbon based on the facts and expert advice - that is, to deal with the biggest issues that confront our nation at this time of change based on a sound public policy approach. The government is taking that sound public policy approach, and I thank the member for New England for taking a sound public policy approach. It is a refreshing change to what we so frequently see in this parliament from those opposite with their negativity.                 To come to the member for New England's question, the government has announced - and the member for New England has been involved in this - that we are working to achieve a national partnership agreement where we will work with the states to strike a national partnership agreement and create an independent scientific body to assess coal seam gas and large coal operations, along with independent bioregional assessments. This is important because coal seam gas is part of the energy mix for our future. We will continue to be a nation that mines coal, so large coal operations will also be a part of our future. But there has clearly been concern from communities about the scientific backdrop - a lot of fear and alarm. I think it is important that everyone, including community members themselves, has the benefits of the best possible science.                 As the federal government, we have shown through this government and governments in the past that it has traditionally been within the domain of the Commonwealth government to show scientific leadership for the nation with our great institutions like the CSIRO. We will be showing that scientific leadership through this new independent scientific body.                 I was specifically asked about transition arrangements. Transition arrangements will be expedited through the establishment of this independent expert scientific committee. I have asked the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to expedite establishing an interim independent expert scientific committee which will come into effect before the full arrangements can be put in place. That will follow consultation with the states on membership of the committee. This will ensure that approvals for extractive licences can be informed by the interim expert committee as soon as it is operational. Transitional arrangements for proposed projects will depend on what stage in its development a project is in.                 The EPBC Act already requires rigorous consideration of the science underpinning decision making, and this will continue. It is not expected that this will unduly delay projects. However, some approval processes will need to be extended to allow time for the independent expert scientific committee to prepare its advice. These measures are necessary to improve community confidence.                 Projects which are already approved will continue as before. They will remain subject to the conditions already contained in their approvals. For coal seam gas projects that have been approved by the Commonwealth government in Queensland, the Commonwealth expert advisory panel has been in operation since May 2011, and this panel will continue to advise the minister for the environment. So from those arrangements we will be getting on with the job as quickly as we can, as soon as we can, working with the states and also working with businesses so that there are not undue delays but there is the best possible science available to all.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for an incredibly important question. We know that when we abolished Work Choices and introduced the Fair Work Act we made very clear our government's commitment to fair pay and fair conditions for all Australian workers. But it is also important to know that now, in 2011, there remains a substantial wage gap between men and women in this country; that right now 60 per cent of women who are retiring at the moment have absolutely no superannuation; and that women remain vastly over-represented among those who are reliant upon welfare in their retirement years, with over 70 per cent of those claiming the single age pension being Australian women.                 Our government continues to tackle these issues with real reforms to ensure that Australian women do not get left behind. We know that the pay gap is in part due to the occupations that women have traditionally worked in being undervalued and poorly paid occupations. In fact, Fair Work Australia ruled earlier this year that community sector work is undervalued in part because it is viewed as 'women's work'. I do not think that anyone in this House would question just how hard and important are the jobs of the people who work with people with disabilities, of those who counsel families in crisis or of those support workers in domestic violence sectors. This is why, on this side, we stood proud as the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government would join with the Australian Services Union to ensure that these workers received a fair pay increase and pledged $2 billion to fund our fair share of this increase. We know that this has real impacts. The sort of impact we are talking about with this funding is that a disability support worker could receive an extra $7,000 in their annual salary; that a youth outreach worker could receive an additional $12,000; and that a drug and alcohol counsellor could receive an additional $18,000. When 120,000 of the 150,000 community workers in this country are women, we know that this is a hugely important commitment not just for Australian workers but for Australian women.                 On this side we stand united behind the Prime Minister's pledge, and you would hope that those opposite would be united behind their support for equal pay as well. However, we have seen another split from the opposition. We have seen the shadow minister for finance saying, 'We think that it is a very deserving cause, that it's a position that in government we would back.' Yet that is not supported by the shadow Treasurer, who has come out and said, 'There's a simple lesson here: don't spend money that we haven't got.' We believe that this is a worthy cause. Equal pay for all Australian workers is something where we have said we are prepared to find that money in our responsible budgeting initiatives. But we also know that we should not be surprised by that, because this builds on the strong actions that this government has already announced to boost the opportunities and the participation of Australian women.                 In tax reform we have announced plans to treble the tax-free threshold, which will put more money in the pockets of some 3.7 million women with taxable incomes under $80,000. This is particularly significant for the many women who are working part time. But, of course, also when it comes to superannuation reforms, as we have heard repeatedly from the Assistant Treasurer, the abolition of superannuation taxation arrangements for low-income workers will boost the retirement savings of some 2.1 million Australian women by $550 million in 2012-13 alone. In addition, the increase to the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent will ensure a 30-year-old woman will have an extra -

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question. My recollection is that I have been asked it before in this parliament, with that reference to President Obama's words. But let me say to the member for Ryan, who may be recycling a question from the past, that the answer to her question is as follows. In making sure that the biggest polluters, who currently put carbon pollution into our atmosphere for nothing, pay a price so that we reduce carbon pollution and do not see that carbon pollution increasing endlessly because there is no incentive to reduce it, which is the situation now - in putting a price on carbon pollution - what we have then done is, through Treasury modelling, to model the effects. I know that modelling has been frequently misrepresented by the opposition, but the modelling that the member for Ryan may want to direct her attention to shows what the flowthrough cost of living impact will be for Australian families, including the impact on electricity pricing. You model all of that impact, as the experts at Treasury have. These are the same experts who advised the coalition, when they were in office, about things like the goods and services tax and got the modelling right.                 Those same experts have advised that the flow-through impact for families will be 0.7 per cent as an increase to CPI - that is, it will be less than a cent in a dollar. Understanding that, what the government has done is ensure that we direct money from big polluters to working families. They will see that through the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That means that working Australians, some of whom are in the tax system now, will no longer pay tax. It also means that those working Australians -                      Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister was asked if she agreed with President Obama that under a cap-and-trade system electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. She has to say either no or yes to that.                     I was asked about electricity prices and carbon pricing and I am ensuring that in providing that answer I am giving the facts for Australian working families. I understand that the question is asked as part of a fear campaign and a campaign of saying no. But I have got sufficient respect for Australian working families that when I answer a question like this I will go through the facts. I think they are entitled to the facts.                 The facts are the biggest polluters will pay. The facts are the implication for families is a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI - less than a cent in a dollar. The facts are that there will be tens of thousands of Australians, hundreds of thousands of Australians, who pay tax now who no longer will. The facts are that people who earn less than $80,000 a year will see tax cuts, many of them tax cuts of $300 a year. The facts are that people will see increases in their family payments. The facts are that people will see increases in their pensions. These are the facts. No amount of misrepresentation, no amount of shouting no, no amount of fear campaigning, no amount of any of this from the opposition changes those facts.                 To the member for Ryan: if she wants to get correct information to people in her community it is available to them. She should not go around misleading them about the impact on electricity prices. The facts are available and she should be distributing those facts to her constituents.                 A point of order regarding relevance may be taken only once in respect of each answer.

  I thank the member for Greenway for that very important question, because in the next 24 hours every member of this chamber will have the opportunity to stand up for working families and for small businesses in their electorate. If they do not, they will simply abandon them to cheap politics. Putting in place the MRRT is the way in which we can spread the opportunities of the mining boom to every corner of our country. It is a way in which we can ensure the resources the Australian people own 100 per cent are spread right around our country instead of just being sent overseas to overseas shareholders. This is a way in which all Australians share in the bounty of the mining boom. That is very important because it goes to the essence of what we are on about in this chamber and that is the creation of jobs in Australia. There is nothing that we on this side of the House are prouder of than the fact that we have created, over the past four years, 750,000 jobs in this country. We are proud of that. It is in our DNA. That is what the electorates send us here for - to put in place job creation.                      Their DNA is Work Choices and ripping off working Australian families. That is in their DNA.                     There is no greater engine room of jobs in our economy than small businesses. We have 2.7 million small businesses in this country and they employ a lot of Australians. Putting in place the $6,500 instant asset write-off is a big job generator for small business and a big job generator for our economy. If those opposite vote against a $6,500 instant asset write-off, that will be a very dark day for those in the party of Menzies who think they stand for small business - the party that Mr Menzies described as standing for the strivers, the planners and ambitious small businesses. That is where we stand on this side of the House. We stand for the strivers, the planners and those with ambition in our economy. That is why we stand for a significant tax cut to small business. But it is a measure of how negative those opposite have become. It is a measure of how far they will go to wreck sensible policy proposals that they could oppose a tax cut for small business. We on this side of the House also stand for working Australians and a big boost to their superannuation funded by the profits of 20 or 30 superprofitable mining companies and, by and large, supported by the mining companies.                 The Leader of the Opposition gave a speech last night about economic policies. I would call it the magic pudding speech. He claimed he had fiscal discipline and then announced he was going to abolish a tax paid by the 20 most profitable companies in the country. He wants to spend more, save less and have bigger surpluses. That is a magic pudding and it shows how unqualified and unfit for office those opposite are.

  Thank you very much, and the answer to the question is very simple, because the modelling does not.                     No amount of hysterical laughter changes the facts, as I have explained yesterday and today. I know that the opposition, in order to keep its fear campaign going, needs to keep twisting things, but these are the facts - and I assume that the member who asked me the question is genuinely interested in the facts. The modelling assumes two things. It assumes that nations match the lower end of their commitments. For Australia that is minus five per cent. That is what the modelling assumes. I am sure the member has been talking about this within the Liberal Party. There has been a campaign to try to distort this publicly, to keep providing grist to the mill of the fear campaign of the opposition, but those are the facts of the modelling, and no amount of shouting or asking or re-asking the same question, day after day after day, will change those facts.                 I would also say to the member who asked the question: once again, just like the question from the Leader of the Nationals, there is starting to be an implication in these questions that Australia should do nothing. If there has been a change in the position of the opposition - we know that some days the Leader of the Opposition backs in the miners' five per cent target; we know that some days he goes out to public meetings of Australians and describes it as crazy - then I think we should hear about that change.                  I would also say to the member who asked the question that, as a long-serving member in this place, he may want to reflect on the fact that every living Liberal leader, including the Leader of the Opposition, has supported a price on carbon. He may want to have that conversation with the Leader of the Opposition, who is on the record as supporting a price on carbon, as is every one of his living predecessors. It is a longstanding Liberal Party position, backed by the Leader of the Opposition himself.                  Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. In the next 24 hours, the House will get a chance to vote on a major piece of taxation reform in Australia. It actually goes to our capacity as a nation to spread the benefits of the resources boom that is occurring in Australia. Hopefully, despite the normal carping and negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, and his campaign to undermine the integrity of this tax, the House will support this key piece of legislation. I have reminded the House on numerous occasions that, yes, the coalition sought to talk down Australia as an attractive place for foreign investment.                  There is no sovereign risk. Mining industry investment is expected to be around $80 billion in 2011-12 alone. Importantly, this investment is creating real jobs for Australians, with demand for new workers by 2016 expected, in the construction and mining sector alone, to reach 131,900 jobs. It is also enabling us to actually invest in the training of young Australians. The Banana Engineering Skills Training Centre at Biloela is a prime example of that. With a Commonwealth contribution of $2.5 million, it will give local young men and women apprenticeship opportunities which they would otherwise have been denied. These are real outcomes on the ground to the benefit of the local community - and, I might say, to the pleasure of their parents.                  We are also about trying to assist the forgotten people in the mind of the coalition. Small business is the engine room of job growth in Australia. When the coalition votes against this key piece of taxation reform sometime in the next 24 hours, they will want to remember that this is what they are voting against. Many small businesses in their electorates will get the opportunity to put in place an instant write-off of small business opportunities for new capital equipment of up to $6,500. Importantly, this instant write-off is not capped. It applies to as many assets as a business wants to buy, where each is under $6,500. It also means that around 720,000 incorporated small businesses will have a cut in company taxation a year ahead of the rest of Australian companies. This is what is at stake when the opposition determines to continue to vote against this legislation.                 They are also saying to small businesses that, when it comes to the key resource companies - such as BHP, with a record profit of $22.48 billion for 2011, an increase of 86 per cent - they should not be allowed to spread the benefits by paying higher taxation to the whole Australian community. Fortescue Metals had an increase in profits of 76 per cent. Rio Tinto had a record $7.8 billion profit in the first six months of 2011, an increase of 35 per cent. Xstrata had a half-year profit in 2011 up 25 per cent - in essence, up 23 per cent in terms of the $16.7 billion in revenue.                 So I remind the House that the coalition once prided itself in the mind of its founding father for standing up for small business. I quote from his foundation speech:                 It is on the protection of small business that the growth of general business and employment largely depends.                 We are seeking to assist the forgotten people: small business people who create jobs in Australia. The coalition should reassess its position and stand up for taxation reform and supporting working people and small businesses.

  My recollection is that I have been asked this question before. I am very confident I have been asked a question referring to Iran before, and the same answer I gave then is the answer that I will give now.                     Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The answer to the question is the same as the answer has always been, which is that the way in which the member asking the question has just described the Treasury modelling is not right. As has been answered before in this parliament, there is not country-specific information the way the member puts it. We have had Iran pointed to in this parliament before, and it was clear then and is clear now that the modelling has been done on a different basis.                 Let me be very clear with the member about the way in which the modelling has been done. The Treasury modelling makes two key assumptions about international action.                     The next two words I was going to say were two 'key assumptions'. So the answer is as follows. The answer remains as it has always been. The facts are the facts, and no amount of negative campaigning from people without policies changes the facts. And the facts are as follows. The Treasury modelling makes two key assumptions about international action: first, that countries meet their low-end pollution reduction targets for 2020; second, that countries have access to international abatement. Looking at the meaning of those assumptions in the world in which we live - looking at Australia, for example, where we have given a pledge of minus five per cent in 2020 - we are assuming that there is an effort that countries do meet the low end of their targets. We are also assuming that there is access to international abatement, and there is access to international abatement. That is because other places in the world have carbon pricing schemes to which you can internationally link.                 They are the assumptions in the modelling. On day 2 of question time every question is based on a wrong premise. That is what happens when you have no policies and no plans. And there you are, trying to conjure, to continue a fear campaign. That is what you get reduced to.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. The fact is that this government has doubled investment in school education. It has upgraded facilities in schools all across Australia. It has provided a greater range of information for parents and the school community than ever before. This government has put education smack centre in the agenda that we have to make sure that every single student in Australia, regardless of where they live and regardless of how much money their parents earn, gets a great education.                 We have introduced Australia's first national curriculum. We now have a national curriculum in English, maths, science and history. We have updated the My School website. There is more information on school finances and more information on student progress. We have invested $2.5 billion over 10 years so that every high school student in Australia gets access to a trade trading centre. Already, funding is benefiting more than 900 schools.                  At the Southern Cross Catholic Vocational College in Burwood, money has been very well invested. I am asked about the barriers to this reform agenda, and the fact is that every single initiative of this government on education is met by a barrage of negativity from those opposite. It does not matter whether we talk about installing half a million computers in high schools - a program that will see over 780,000 computers delivered to Australian schools throughout this whole program - the opposition wants to cut this program.                 The Leader of the Opposition last night again confirmed at the Sydney Institute that this program is up for the cut. Australian families must be wondering why the Leader of the Opposition does not want their children to have computers in schools, including the 15 schools in his own electorate, which I am sure have got those computers.                 We have commissioned a review into school funding arrangements across Australia for the first time since 1973 and we have record investments in national partnerships across the states and territories, totalling some $2.5 billion. What are they about? They are about addressing disadvantage, improving teacher quality, and looking at literacy and numeracy - the basic building blocks that all our kids need to get the best out of their education. Again, these are the very things that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut. Cuts to literacy and numeracy programs, cuts to breakfast programs, cuts to homework centres, cuts to teachers' salaries, and cuts to programs targeting Indigenous kids and kids from poor communities. This is the kind of agenda on education that the Leader of the Opposition is offering for us.                 I have been very pleased that the government has been able to deliver new funding for students with disabilities - something we recognise is of huge concern to parents right around Australia. We are expanding the chaplaincy student welfare worker program and providing specific focus on Indigenous students. When Labor members and other members in the House go to schools for speech days and end-of-year events, they will be very proud, because they will see the biggest school modernisation program that has ever taken place. They will be able to talk to the school community about the record levels of investment provided by this government.                   I wonder very much whether those opposite will actually have the honesty to say, 'We're against all of this.' We see the future on this side of the House as one of enabling Australian parents and their kids to get the best education they can and the best opportunities they can by providing the investment that we have over this period of time and making sure that every school is a great school and is a great -

  They never fail to surprise. They have been around Australia saying that mining companies pay too much tax and that the federal government should not put in place a resource rent tax. They said that, because of our resource rent tax, mining would stop, investment would stop and jobs would be lost. That was the story they were telling the whole time until, suddenly, out of the blue, the Western Australian government increased mining royalties. Did they oppose that? No. They thought: 'That's a good idea. It's not going to stop investment. It's not going to stop jobs.' And of course they continued, after the Western Australian government did that, to go around the country -                      I was asked about royalties. The fact is that the review into taxation found that royalties were a very inefficient tax and that what Australia should do is put in place a resource rent tax to encourage the industry to expand and to encourage investment. They found that the application of royalties was particularly bad for those miners -                      The New South Wales government has not specified fully the nature of their royalty regime. They have not done that as yet. For example, they said that it would not be paid by those who are paying the MRRT. That was one of the qualifications they put on it. We have not seen the detail from New South Wales about their inefficient royalty regime. It is a bit rich coming from the shadow Treasurer who has a $70 billion crater in his budget bottom line. He is asking me where $3 billion from New South Wales is coming from, when they have not said so themselves.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. He knows that this Labor government is determined to do everything it possibly can to support families to give their children the best start in life. We know that Australian families take this responsibility very seriously, and so does this Labor government.                 It is this Labor government that introduced Australia's first paid parental leave scheme - never delivered by those opposite. Now, as a result of us delivering this first paid parental leave scheme, 100,000 Australian families have registered for paid parental leave and their children, their newborn babies, are getting the benefit of paid parental leave.                 It is this Labor government that is delivering on 1 January significant increases to family tax benefit part A for those families with older teenagers who continue on in secondary school - once again, never delivered by those opposite. Those opposite seem to think that when your child reaches 16 they do not cost as much - which demonstrates just how out of touch those opposite are with the needs of working families in this country. It is this Labor government that will make sure that Australian families with older teenagers who are still going to school will get up to around $4,000 extra, and that will start on 1 January.                 This Labor government is delivering for Australian families and making sure that we support those families as they balance their budgets and as they care for their children. We are the government that understands that, for all Australian families, the most important thing that they can do for their children is be great role models by not only going out to work every day but also making sure that they show their children that this is the best way to be responsible in the future. And 750,000 more Australians have got a job because of this Labor government - something that we know is so critical to the future of children in this country. And it is this Labor government that will also make sure that, as we deliver a price on carbon, we also deliver increased support for families and increased support for Australian pensioners.                 What do we hear from those opposite? All we hear from this Leader of the Opposition is that he wants to say no. He is saying that it is a 'blood oath' that he is going to take money out of the pockets of Australian families, out of the pockets of pensioners - because he wants to cut the pension increase and cut the family payment increase. All he can say is no, no, no. That is all he can say.

  There is only one crisis going on around here, and it is on the opposition front bench. They have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. The shadow Treasurer went on television and confirmed it. The shadow finance minister has confirmed it publicly. They have a $70 billion crater and they want to talk about fiscal discipline! Well, they have come to the right place, because we are absolutely determined to keep in place the fiscal discipline that has been a hallmark of our government.                 What we need at a time of global uncertainty is consistency and very sound economic policy. We are determined to keep Australians in jobs. What we did during the global financial crisis was put jobs and good budget management right to the forefront of our economic policy. We kept this country out of recession, and we were opposed by them every step of the way. The consequence of that has been the creation of 750,000 jobs. Our GDP is six per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis because we handled that global uncertainty with good budget policy and sound economic management. What we are seeing in the global economy -                  But I remind the member for Goldstein, as I would remind, yet again, the Treasurer, that the standing order now is 'direct relevance'. It is not 'direct answer'. I cannot dictate how in fact the response will be put together. The Treasurer is aware of his responsibilities under the standing order, and I advise him to relate his material to the question, but in doing so, there is nothing so far that gives me great concern. I remind the Treasurer of the need to be directly relevant.                     We will be producing by the end of the year our Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We will be doing it in the normal way but we will be doing it in very difficult global economic conditions.                      They are just demonstrating how they are incapable of understanding the international or national economies, Mr Speaker. The fact is that global growth has been revised down, and you have seen that again today with statements from the head of the IMF. That does have an impact on growth in Australia. You saw that through the Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy a couple of weeks ago when they revised down growth from four to 3Â¼ per cent. As a consequence, we are preparing our materials and forecasts for the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and, given the uncertainty, the hit to confidence and all of the impacts of the global financial crisis, that will have an impact on revenues in our Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and we will account for that in the normal way.                 Yes, we will be having budget savings and, if those people opposite claim that they are responsible, they will be supporting them in this House. We are absolutely committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, because that is the right thing to do, sending a clear and consistent message about fiscal policy in an uncertain international environment and, given the fact that growth in this country is still around trend and given that jobs are our priority, we will present a very responsible document with all of the usual analysis.                      But implicit in the shadow finance minister's question was yet again another rubbishing of professional Treasury officials. Every time things do not go their way in the debate, what do they do? They go out and can the bureaucracy, the very people who provided professional advice to them, advice which they accepted in office for almost a dozen years. We will never do that. We will behave responsibly. You can go back to your wrecking style in this House. I will tell you what, it is not appreciated by the Australian people. Just saying no is not a policy. The Leader of the Opposition is all opposition and no leadership. There is no substance, just all bluff and bluster.

  I thank the member for Bendigo for his question because I know he is one of the very proud members of this House to have the Bendigo GP superclinic just opened in his electorate. His is the 19th superclinic that is fully operational, and it is providing extra GP services, nurses and allied health services in Bendigo and working very closely with the hospital services that are being provided.                 Our GP superclinics program has provided over 630,000 services to patients across Australia. But last night the Leader of the Opposition again made clear that this program is a program that he is going to cut. As per usual, the only policy that the Leader of the Opposition had was to say no. He has a $70 billion hole in his own budget and he is intending to fill it by saying no to doctors, no to nurses, no to superclinics, and no to hospital services.                     It is very interesting that, although the Leader of the Opposition says no every time he is asked to provide support for health services, the members of his backbench and frontbench do not always say the same thing in their electorates.                     So, my friend Member for Paterson, when the Port Stephens superclinic opened in his electorate, said to NBN Television:                 This has my absolute support.                 Interestingly, the member for Paterson has a second superclinic coming to his electorate, in Raymond Terrace, and he has been lobbying me to make sure that it goes exactly where he would like it to go.                      So the Leader of the Opposition says no, but members of his frontbench say yes. I know that the member for Gilmore is sitting quietly there, but she happily attended, as she should as the local member, the opening of the Shellharbour superclinic, and she said that she believed these clinics were worth pursuing if they attracted services to doctor-starved regions like her own. So she says yes in her local electorate, but here the Leader of the Opposition just says no.                 What about the member for Parkes? Gunnedah used to be in his electorate. Unfortunately the redistribution has moved it, but the member for New England has been very appreciative. Mr Coulton said that this was a 'long-held dream' for the people of Gunnedah and 'an exciting model' and he paid 'tribute to Minister Roxon'. So although the Leader of the Opposition says no, the member for Parkes says yes.                 The majority of these clinics are in coalition seats, and these clinics are being welcomed by local members, although the Leader of the Opposition still says no. Let me give you the latest edition. The member for Flynn told locals in Emerald of their GP superclinic -                       This is important. I think people should listen, because the member for Flynn said: 'Just for the record I have to say this. My party does not believe in super clinics but we do - we are in favour, we do stand with - we do support the Labor government and Minister Roxon and stand beside her in progressing these clinics and there is no-one more than myself who wants to see it work in Emerald.' So they cannot make up their minds which side of this they are on, because when it comes to health services the Leader of the Opposition just wants to say no and what he is proving is a leopard cannot change his spots.                     Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  After a night of saying no, no, no, no to a minerals resource rent tax to ensure that all Australians can share in the opportunities that come with this resources boom, we see the Leader of the Opposition come into this place and continue his campaign of relentless negativity. If the Leader of the Opposition had worked his way through this morning, he would have seen the following: I have verified publicly that the government has decided to action a modest savings measure which we had in contemplation in the course of preparing for the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The details of this modest savings measure were released this morning. They were released so that we could go through a proper process of contacting stakeholders.                 But the real thing that amazes me about the Leader of the Opposition's question is the suggestion that he would be interested in anything that looked like the facts - as if the facts have ever informed a decision of the Leader of the Opposition. If he cared about the facts then he would recognise that the Australian economy is in a time of transformation when our big miners, particularly, are super-profitable. Our big miners have worked to reach an agreement with the government that they will pay more tax. Those big miners are making their profits from the minerals wealth in our ground that belongs to all Australians. During this time of our nation's development it is the right thing to do and the fair thing to do for Australians around the nation to ask those big miners to pay more tax - miners who are super-profitable - so that can be used to share the opportunities from the resources boom to bring a fair share to working people.                 That fair share will come in the form of backing an increase in superannuation, better retirement incomes and a better pool of national savings. It will come with better investments in mining infrastructure. Mining brings benefits to communities, but it also brings strain and consequently we need more investment in infrastructure. It will share the opportunities of the mining boom by giving special tax breaks to small business - to those hardworking Australians who use their spirit of entrepreneurship to make a living for themselves and to employ others. Those Australians will enjoy an instant asset write-off of $6,500 as they invest in their businesses. At the same time, we will cut company tax for businesses that pay company tax to spread the opportunities of the mining boom.                 If the Leader of the Opposition cared at all about the facts then he would not have come into this parliament in the early hours of this morning and voted no, no, no to a fair share for working Australians from the benefits of the resources boom.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her very important question. In the House last night we passed legislation that will stand the test of time, against the rabid objections of everyone on that side of the House. We had the foresight to seize the national interest, and the courage to act. That is what is required of government given the challenges that we face in this country and in our region.                 We have seen mining profits jump something like 250 per cent in the last decade. That demands a resource rent based tax. These resources are non-renewable; they can only be sold once. Because of the mining boom and because of what is happening in the Asian century, we know that our economy is facing profound structural changes. Not everybody is in the fast lane of the mining boom. Many people in small business are being left behind. What we must do is spread the benefit of this boom to every corner of our country. That is what the government has had the foresight to do.                 Over 18 months ago we moved to put in place a resource rent tax, the MRRT, so we could give a boost to small business and boost the superannuation savings of Australian workers, and so that the benefits could be spread right across our country by ensuring that the superprofits are taxed on 20 to 30 of our largest mining companies and distributed around our country. This will give small businesses that $6,500 instant asset write-off, so important to get cash flow and business investment. There is all of that, plus the need to invest in infrastructure, particularly in our mining regions and places like Mackay, Rockhampton and right up the Queensland coast, and in Western Australia, particularly up in the north-west, and of course in places like the Hunter. Investing in infrastructure in those great mining regions is very important.                 But, most importantly, we are boosting the superannuation savings of 8.4 million workers. Those ships which are heading over the horizon will be contributing to the retirement savings of eight million Australian workers. We know that we have to build a national savings pool to build our nation. We know that, as a capital-hungry country, we do need to lift our national savings. What better way to build sovereign wealth funds - eight million of them - than to boost the superannuation savings of eight million workers?                 We know that these two measures are opposed by those opposite. They have been captured by special interests and by vested interests - by a few large mining companies - and they are dancing to their tune. They have sold Australia short. But last night in this parliament we took the hard decisions for the future. We have a leader who is capable of taking the hard decisions. We have a leader who has foresight about what we have to do for future generations, unlike those opposite, where there is no leadership - it is all opposition. All we get from this Leader of the Opposition is aggression, but there is no substance - none at all.

  The shadow Treasurer should not judge everybody else by his standards. He has got a $70 billion crater in his budget bottom line and he has got the hide to stand up in this House and ask us about our forward estimates. What you will see from this government, and what you will continue to see, is very strict fiscal discipline. We will bring our budget back into surplus in 2012-13 and we will give an update of our budget in the normal way through the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We will do all of those things because we are serious about fiscal policy. The hide of those getting up to argue about a hole in the budget when they have a $70 billion hole in theirs just belies the fact that they have completely lost the plot when it comes to the national economy. We stand by our published estimates. They will be updated shortly and then the weight will be on the opposition to see how responsible they are.

  I thank the member for her question and I thank her for her interest in how in this phase of our economy's transformation and change we are going to ensure that Australians around the nation get their fair share. As a Labor government when this nation was confronted by the global financial crisis, we did what needed to be done to keep Australians in jobs, because we were determined that in that phase of the nation's economy when that international threat loomed we would keep Australians working, and we are very proud of the track record of creating jobs in this country - more than 700,000 of them. We achieved that working with employers, businesses large and small, and also with the trade union movement to keep people in work.                 Now, as we look at the circumstances of our economy, what we know is our nation is enjoying a resources boom, and that is a good thing. When we look at this, the Asian century, we know that the demand for our resources will be sustained over time and that the prices paid for them will be high against historic averages. In those circumstances, with a part of the economy turbocharged, with big mining companies making superprofits, many Australians are legitimately asking themselves the question, 'The resources boom is a good thing but what does it mean for me and my family?' The resources boom is a good thing now, but well into the future, in the days that lie beyond this resources boom, what will Australia do then? What will our economy look like then? These are legitimate questions being asked by Australians. In the House of Representatives in the early hours of this morning the government provided a substantial part of the answer.                  The way in which we will manage this period of economic change is by having an efficient profits based tax for that section of the economy that is turbocharged and by using that to share opportunity around the country. How will those opportunities be shared? Working Australians can look forward to a better retirement as a result of this new taxation arrangement, backing in changes to superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That will mean an extra $108,000 in retirement income for a 30-year-old today. It will also mean growth in our $1.3 trillion pool of national savings and national assets so important to us during the global financial crisis. It will also mean tax relief for hardworking small business people who are taking the risks, who are doing the hard yards and who are working weekends to provide for themselves and their families and to employ other Australians. The measures will assist 2.7 million small businesses employing around five million people. At the same time, we will cut the company tax rate to share the opportunity and jobs which come with the resources boom. Because we understand that mining bring benefits but it also brings hunger for infrastructure in mining communities, we will invest $6 billion in the infrastructure the nation needs.                 This is the right economic policy setting for this period of our nation's growth and transformation. It is about jobs, it is about growth, it is about fairness to working Australians and it is a stark contrast to the relentless negativity, the saying of no, no, no by the opposition as they did last night when they rejected superannuation for working Australians, rejected jobs growth for working Australians and rejected growth in our national savings.

  It is another demonstration that abuse and conspiracy theories are not a substitute for policy - policies the opposition will never have because they are addicted to saying no. They are addicted to negativity. They are addicted to trashing the national interest in what they perceive to be their political interest. To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say this: it is striking me as somewhat odd that on the one hand the opposition has come into this parliament and said the minerals resource rent tax will kill the mining industry, and now the political criticism and political case of the opposition appears to be that the minerals resource rent tax is not big enough. Then, of course -                      from the Leader of the Opposition we have seen him tick carbon pricing, we have seen him campaign against carbon pricing -                      and now, apparently, his political case is that carbon pricing is not enough - a remarkable turnaround! These people are so negative they are now at war with their own case against the minerals resource rent tax and carbon pricing.                 On the question of budget discipline and returning the budget to surplus, even in these economic times, where we are seeing instability in the euro zone affecting the global economy, the government is determined to bring the budget to surplus and we will be updating all of our economic figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. I really am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition would come into this parliament and ask a question about fiscal discipline, given the recorded statement of his shadow minister for finance. The recorded statement of his shadow for finance is:                 ... we are saying that we need to identify up to $70 billion over the next four years if we are to get -                      Thank you very much. I would suggest to the opposition that they might use some of that energy, instead of howling abuse, to get their figures in some sort of order. The recorded statement of the shadow finance minister -                      No amount of screaming actually changes this: the shadow finance minister of the opposition said: 'We are saying that we need to identify up to $70 billion of cuts.' And then on another occasion he was asked to verify that figure and he said:                 No, it's not a furphy. We came out with that figure _                 The statement of the shadow minister for finance. Ever since then, the Leader of the Opposition has been seeking to mislead the Australian people and pretend that that was somehow a figure that emanated from the government or others. It is the statement of his shadow finance minister that they need to find $70 billion worth of savings. And that stands on top of the statement of the Leader of the National Party that the savings that they identified at the last election have largely evaporated. That means -                      The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just use the word 'embarrassing'. Yes, it is embarrassing -                      that the Liberal Party has got itself into a situation where it is $70 billion behind the starting line. Before it can even get to the starting line where the government is, it needs to find $70 billion of savings. And we know what $70 billion of savings in Liberal-speak is all about - it is all about cuts to services working families need, because this Leader of the Opposition has got a track record when it comes to cutting away services that working families need. Can I say to the opposition: rather than come and scream abuse, maybe they should start producing some savings to fill that $70 billion crater.

  I have to say that the question is an unexpected one given the tenor of remarks made when we dealt with your election, Mr Speaker, and the farewells to the member for Scullin. In answer to the question: the former Speaker, the member for Scullin, came to see me at 7.30 this morning and advised me that he would be tendering his resignation at 9 am. In relation to discussions with the current occupant of the Speaker's office, I have had no discussion with the Speaker, other than the public remarks I have made in this place.
