 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Following the cyclone, I talked to people as best I could on what was a difficult day of weather so that we could not get as far as we would have liked to on our journey in the helicopter. Even on the occasions when I was out on the ground, it was raised with me that there were other forms of assistance following Cyclone Larry. They were some special forms of assistance for the banana industry and there were other producers in the region including those who produce exotic fruits - lychees and those kinds of things - that raised questions of special assistance with me.The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is that we have at this stage, working with the Queensland government, triggered the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which include concessional loans of up to $250,000 for small businesses and primary producers. It also triggers other forms of assistance for small businesses and primary producers including clean-up money. It also triggers, and we have triggered, the ability to use income support recovery payments so that people who cannot ply their ordinary trade and go to work or small businesses or farmers who cannot get their ordinary income because of the disaster are entitled to some payments.The government believes it will have to work with the Queensland government and the local community on a package that recognises the special characteristics of this region hit by the cyclone. We have commenced some of those discussions with the Queensland government. Their ability to consult communities on how this should be best done has been constrained just by the physical logistics of (1) bad weather (2) a lot of damage and (3) turning their efforts first to the provision of food, water, shelter and trying to open up blocked transport routes so that supplies can continue to get through. But as the efforts move from that immediate humanitarian work we will do the consultations necessary with Queensland and with the local community to see how we can best structure future arrangements to meet the special needs of this region.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She was one of a number of members who had the opportunity yesterday in the House to share their reflections on the summer of disasters that we have all shared and her reflections from her local community. I did have the opportunity to visit with her in Rockhampton. They are very stoic people. They were very well prepared. They were isolated for a very long period of time. But as we started the process yesterday of sharing some reflections - and we will continue to do that during the course of this week and beyond - it is also important to reflect on the way in which Australians got in to help each other. They did not need to be told; they did not need to be asked. They just got in to help each other, and they obviously expected that government would do the same.Consequently, we have got in to help people as these natural disasters have unfolded. I can advise the House - and these figures are accurate as at 3 February - that we have already granted 38,000 claims totalling $17 million in disaster income recovery subsidy. We have also accepted 350,000 claims, granting a total of $421 million under the Australian government disaster recovery payment - that is, the emergency money that people can get. Referring, too, to the Leader of the Opposition's question to me just a few moments ago, we are already seeing take-up of clean-up and recovery grants for small businesses and primary producers: 925 clean-up and recovery grants have been granted in Queensland, totalling $4.5 million; and 237 clean-up and recovery grants have gone to small businesses and primary producers in New South Wales, totalling $3.5 million. We have also seen uptake under the emergency assistance provisions of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, the personal hardship and distress assistance, in the order of $13 million. We are dealing with 7,560 applications to date for essential household contents in Queensland and 1,986 applications to date for assistance with people's dwellings.The government responded quickly to make this emergency assistance available because it was needed. We have responded quickly, too, to make the decisions that are necessary to support rebuilding. The nation is looking to us to make the decisions necessary to enable us to rebuild in Queensland and around the nation. That is why I announce that the government will invest at least $5.6 billion in rebuilding. That figure has been drawn from preliminary estimates. We will do that by making space in the federal budget, by reprioritising and reprofiling infrastructure, and also by asking Australians to make a contribution. I believe Australians do want to assist those who have been affected by these natural disasters. We will be asking Australians to make that contribution through the levy that I have announced. Every dollar collected in that levy is matched by $2 that has been made available in cutbacks through the government's budget, and we have reprofiled infrastructure not only to make money available but to ensure that we are not pressing and creating additional capacity constraints as the nation tries to rebuild. This is the right package when the nation is looking to us to make the right decisions in this parliament in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and indicate, in part, the answer that I gave the Leader of the Opposition. I do want to be clear with the parliament about the ability of people to apply for the disaster income subsidy arrangement - that is, the arrangement for 13 weeks of assistance if people are not able to go about their ordinary trade because of circumstances like being cut off by floodwaters. The assistance that the government is already providing is not quite as confined as the way the member phrased his question. I do not seek to make a big issue of that, but I did not want anybody to be confused about the circumstances in which you can get that recovery payment. That does flow, for example, when people have been cut off and are simply unable for some period of time to get to their ordinary place of work.Can I reiterate what I said to the Leader of the Opposition. We understand that there are impacts broadly in the regions that have been hit by these disasters. We particularly understand that in the region hit by the cyclone. I have seen it from the air myself: acres and acres as far as the eye can see with every tree snapped in half and consequently all of the loss of production that that is going to mean for banana growers and the like. I have seen that damage and I do understand that that will press on people. But we do want to design any additional assistance both in consultation with the Queensland government - because under our Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements we work in partnership on the recovery - and in consultation with the local community.On the package available under Cyclone Larry, even in the few hours I was in the region last Friday and able to talk to people, I had people give me feedback that they thought it was a good package and it worked for them. I had one person give me feedback that it had not worked for her and her business. When you get that kind of feedback, you obviously do want to do the consultation that will enable you to structure assistance so that we can best work with local needs and make a difference to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Of course he and the area he represents were very much affected by floodwaters; indeed, the member for Oxley's electorate office was flooded, meaning that he needed to keep working, representing his community and assisting them during this natural disaster, whilst dealing with a natural disaster in his own electorate office. I am sure everybody wishes him well as he recovers from that. I think we can all imagine what it would be like to have our office cut off and full of floodwaters as we were trying to go about assisting our community at the same time.To the member for Oxley I can say the following: we have the right plan to rebuild the nation as it recovers from this devastating summer. We have found savings within the budget and we have taken the tough decisions we need in order to make those savings available to support rebuilding. The rest we are asking Australians to share. We are asking Australians to share through a one-off temporary levy. I do note - and people should - that the levy is one-off and temporary. It will last for one year and one year precisely. The vast majority of Australian taxpayers will be asked for less than a dollar a week. People with income of $50,000 and under will not be asked to contribute at all. We have also rephased infrastructure. We have done that in consultation with state governments because we need to make sure that, as well as having the money to rebuild, we have the skills necessary to rebuild - the necessary skilled workers available to get out there and do the construction that we need. Consequently, rephasing infrastructure is not just about government expenditure. It is also about capacity constraints and making sure that we are making available the skilled labour we need. We have also taken some decisions in relation to skilled migration and in relation to unemployed Australians and getting them where they can get a job rebuilding from these devastating natural disasters around the country.I am asked about value for money, and I want to make sure that every taxpayer dollar gets value for money and does the most work. That is why we are ensuring that at every level there is clear accountability and value for money. First, we are creating a reconstruction inspectorate, and I thank former New South Wales Premier and former federal Minister for Finance and Administration John Fahey for taking my invitation to chair that reconstruction inspectorate. -  - It is obviously a very popular choice in the parliament! He will be joined by Martin Albrecht, a former managing director of Thiess, and he will also be joined by Matt Sheerin, who leads the Queensland audit practice of the global firm Deloitte. In addition, we have two very high quality nominees on the board of the Queensland reconstruction authority: Mr Brad Orgill, a former chair and CEO of UBS Australia and the person who oversaw the BER implementation taskforce; and Glenys Beauchamp, the Secretary of the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. We have made Major General Mick Slater available to chair the reconstruction authority. We will also have a national partnership agreement with clear accountabilities for expenditure. We will make sure that expenditure and statements are certified by the Auditor-General before payments are made. It is my intention to make sure through these arrangements that we are deriving value for money as we rebuild from the devastating summer that has been.</DOC>

 - I thank the Shadow Treasurer for this very important question. It really goes to the core of who will pay this levy and who will not. We know, for example, that everybody under $50,000 will not pay this levy. We also know that those over $100,000 will pay more. We also know that those that are receiving payments under our disaster relief arrangements -  - I am going through them. We also know that those that are receiving payments under our disaster relief arrangements - those adults that have received the $1,000 and those with children the $400 - will not be paying that amount of money. I cannot tell you how many of those there are. I cannot tell you, but the Prime Minister before did give you a quantum. Of course we cannot give you a final figure about that. I am more than happy to provide you with estimates later on. I cannot give you a final figure and neither is it realistic to give one. But this levy will raise $1.8 billion and it will be predominantly raised by those on higher incomes. It will be predominantly raised by people like the shadow Treasurer and me. That is where the great bulk of the revenue will come from. About 50 per cent of it will come from higher income earners. Of course, those under $50,000 will not pay anything at all. We will exempt those that have received the disaster payments in Queensland. We will exempt them in Victoria, in northern New South Wales, in Western Australia and elsewhere in the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. I am always delighted to talk about this government's record when it comes to funding child care and early childhood education. As the member may be aware, we have, over the course of our government, massively increased funding in this area - in fact, to more than double the level that the Howard government spent - with over $18 billion to be spent over the next four years on early childhood education and care.Having said that, the member is quite right that this has been not just a massive increase in spending but also a reform process. What that has meant is that there are areas that the federal government was previously funding that are now being left to the states. Equally there are areas that previously the state governments were funding that the federal government is stepping in on. To give an example of this, funding of $12.6 million on neighbourhood model occasional care centres has been ceased by the Commonwealth government, but in place of that there is $955 million which is now being spent by the federal government on universal access to preschool, an area which the states were previously left to fund 100 per cent.To put this in context, in 2009-10 Commonwealth funding for Western Australian neighbourhood model occasional care was some $423,000. Now forgoing that, the Western Australian government is receiving $98 million when it comes to Commonwealth funding for kindergartens. So we have had an extreme reform process and we have massively increased funding in these areas, but there has been a shake-up of responsibilities.The member for O'Connor might be interested that the Western Australian government will fully fund neighbourhood model occasional care services until 30 June 2011 and we expect that this funding should continue given the massive increase in Commonwealth expenditure in Western Australia. But still our government will never walk away from Australian families in need of care, so we have put in place a number of new measures which I am about to outline to help the very families that the member for O'Connor represents. These include direct support for five services in the wheat belt region through sustainability assistance of approximately $150,000 per year, exemptions for six services in the wheat belt region to operate less than five days a week on an ongoing basis and in-principle agreement for two more services to be added to this list so that they will be able to continue to receive Commonwealth support in the wheat belt region.In last year's budget we added $59 million to upgrade budget based funded services. This means that childcare centres in the areas which are facing the biggest disadvantage in Australia are funded and run by the Commonwealth government with no fees in place. We believe that these kids deserve the best service, which is why we have put in place $59 million to upgrade those services. Seventeen of the centres we are upgrading are in Western Australia and I would welcome the opportunity to take the member for O'Connor to visit those centres in his area to show how these improvements are going to help the lives of those children.Ultimately the best thing that the Commonwealth government is now doing for these families and for their children is funding an unlimited number of childcare places in long day care, in family day care and in outside school hours care. This is all part of our commitment to more than double the funding levels that the Howard government put in place and make sure that child care in Australia is accessible, is affordable and is of high quality - because we know that the families who the member for O'Connor represents, like the families that we all represent, rely on this.

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question, because his area was severely damaged. Those areas south of the river, near the city, did have a very dramatic impact from the floods. Something like 5,000 premises in his area were affected and certainly many of those people would have received support payments from the Commonwealth - of that there is no doubt. I think something like 1,000 businesses as well were impacted in that area. The member for Moreton worked tirelessly through that period with those businesses and the affected households, as indeed did many other members in this House on both sides of the aisle. They were out there working with their local communities to make sure they had access to Centrelink so they could access payments and to make sure that services were being delivered by the agencies, whether the city council or the great not-for-profit organisations that played such a role.We talked yesterday about the human impact of this flood, but today I want to talk a little bit about the economic impact of the floods and the cyclones not just in Queensland but elsewhere. Treasury estimates that the January floods alone will knock half a percentage point from growth in 2010-11 and most of that will hit in the March quarter. Of course, that is before you have the impact of Cyclone Yasi, and that impact was great in North Queensland and Far North Queensland. There was a dramatic impact particularly on our coal exports, which may be down as much as $5 billion, and rural production, which may be down as much as $2 billion. And, of course, there was damage to other sectors, as a member said before. There was around $300 million in the tourism sector and around half a billion dollars in remaining industries such as manufacturing, retail and transport.That is all before you get to the price impact - the impact on the CPI and what it actually means to people at the supermarket. Treasury has estimated that the January floods will increase CPI inflation by one quarter of a percentage point in the March quarter, and that is before you get to the impact of Cyclone Yasi, which will probably add another quarter of a percentage point to that figure.Of course, as the Prime Minister was saying before, up there in North Queensland and Far North Queensland 90 per cent of Australia's bananas are produced and about one-third of our sugar is produced. So we will see price rises but, thankfully, they will largely be temporary. They will unwind as crops regrow and production comes back online.Of course, all of this will have an impact, but the thing that we need to remember is that it is not going to knock our economy off its medium-term growth path, and its medium-term growth path is strong. We have a strong investment pipeline, particularly in resources. ABARE estimates there is $380 billion in an investment pipeline in the resources sector alone. We should never forget that we have had very strong job creation - 364,000 jobs in 2010 - and, of course, we do have a strong fiscal position, returning to surplus faster than any other major developed economy. Of course, today we have had a welcome rebound - a small one - in consumer confidence. That is very good. I firmly believe that Australians can have confidence that, as we move forward, activity will recover and we will rebuild from these events.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Of course, a business in those circumstances is entitled to assistance through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements I have just outlined for the damage to the business. It is able to access assistance through the natural disaster recovery arrangements, and we are, of course, more than happy to assist the member on the details of that. I have done my best to advise all members of the coalition with affected electorates about a particular email address they can contact us through to deal with constituent issues, and we can make sure that people get the right information. Of course, members of the government and members on the crossbenches are very welcome too to make inquiries through that email address.On the question of payment of the levy, the exemptions for payment of the levy, because we are talking about personal income taxation, are being figured off the personal arrangements that we have under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements - that is, eligibility for the emergency money under the Australian government disaster relief payment and associated payments. So the aim here in making those exemptions has been to exempt from paying the levy people who have been immediately impacted personally by natural disaster.I would also indicate to the member that, as well as advising her constituents of the relief arrangements for them because of what has happened to their business, she may well want to talk to them about what they ordinarily expect to be their income, because I would remind her that overwhelmingly Australian taxpayers will be asked to pay less than one dollar a week under the levy, and around half of Australian taxpayers are exempt from it entirely because they earn less than $50,000 a year. So the design of this levy - and it does mirror in design some levy arrangements that have been used in the past in this country - is to calibrate the burden on upper income earners. That is absolutely appropriate. People who earn more should be asked to step forward and assist more, and under this levy they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. He too has been affected in his electorate. In the Bendigo electorate some 200 houses and a number of small businesses were affected, and he has been working very hard to ensure that in his community that assistance is delivered where it is needed.The rebuild task here is going to be a huge, huge call on our resources. It is going to require very significant investments by government. We do have longstanding Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements; we had them under the previous government as we have under this government. These arrangements mean that the Commonwealth will meet 75 per cent of the rebuilding costs that fall within the NDRRAs, and also costs which come with some of the income support that the Prime Minister was talking about before.So our initial estimate just in terms of the January floods, before you get to the cyclones and so on, is that it will cost the federal budget $5.6 billion. Of course, as we have said, two-thirds of that funding will be delivered through cuts to the budget and infrastructure deferrals, and, of course, one-third will be provided by our modest levy, which will not be paid by people who earn less than $50,000 and will not be paid by those directly affected by the floods, because it is the responsible thing to do to pay as we go.Of course, I said before that we do have strong long-term fundamentals, but we do need this revenue for the rebuilding process to provide the certainty for those families and those businesses that their government is behind them and prepared to back them. That is why the government moved so decisively to provide that certainty to the business community. But, of course, it is a temporary levy and we do also have to make sure that, when the economy continues to grow, there is room for the rebuilding from the floods as well as the natural growth in our economy. So paying as we go is the responsible thing to do, and it is an approach that has been endorsed. This is what the Financial Times had to say:In this age of reckless sovereigns, the choice of a levy is extraordinary, but prudent.It is absolutely the right thing to do in our circumstances. It is absolutely the right thing to do, because Australians did want to work together to deal with these challenges in their community, and Australians have united behind what the government has done.But, of course, the only one who has not been part of that is the Leader of the Opposition. We saw yesterday their so-called funding package, which consists of deferrals, double counts and backflips. He is all opposition and no leadership.People might take him seriously if he had not actually come into this House on something like six occasions and supported a levy. Who was it who came into this House on 17 June 1996 to support a gun buyback levy? It was the Leader of the Opposition. Who was it who came in 2001 and supported a levy for the Ansett employees? The Leader of the Opposition. If a levy was good enough in the election campaign, it is good enough for people in -

 - I thank the member for his question, because it gives me an opportunity to inform him that they are eligible for money under the NDRRA, and that money is flowing under the NDRRA.But, of course, as he correctly points to it is the case that there will not be sufficient funds under the NDRRA for those people who are uninsured to rebuild in all cases. That is certainly the case, and that is why we have worked as the government, and why so many people and business leaders have worked, to ensure that the public appeal funds are built up so that additional support can go to those communities. That is why donations to the Premier's appeal in Queensland and other appeals around the country are so important.As I was saying before in my previous answer -  - There is indirect assistance to people for their houses. In fact, when I have been around communities, and the Army has been there with people who own those homes, the support has been flowing and so has money to keep those people going in the immediate phases of recovery.As I was saying before, 75 per cent of the public infrastructure is the bill that will flow to the Commonwealth. That is what we are responsible for under the NDRRA. The member for Dawson was talking about homes, donations and so on. Those opposite have been out there using the flood as the opportunity to raise money for the Liberal Party. -  - I was referring to the fact that during all of this - during this extraordinary coming together of our community - where the whole community was out there helping Australians who were in great need -  - we had the spectacle of the Liberal Party using it as a fundraising opportunity.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The response by the Australian Defence Force and its personnel in the face of natural disasters over the recent summer period in Australia has been magnificent.It has been a terrific response. On the one hand it has been spontaneous and on the other hand it has been very well planned. I say spontaneous because we have seen the contribution in three different areas. Firstly, we have seen Army, Navy and Air Force reservists spontaneously take to the streets to help out their local communities. Secondly, we have seen local area commanders make decisions within their authority in the face of emergencies in their own local area. For example, this occurred when we saw recent floods in Carnarvon in my own state of Western Australia. Thirdly, of course, we have seen the much more formal and more broadly planned response when a state, whether it is Queensland or Victoria, in the face of an enormous natural disaster needs the assistance of the Commonwealth and the Australian defence forces.We have seen that assistance come from members of all of the three arms of the service. I just take this opportunity to thank, for example, Colonel Luke Foster and Brigadier Paul McLachlan, who headed up our Operation Queensland Flood Assist task force; Brigadier Stuart Smith, who is currently heading up our Operation Yasi Assist task force; and Brigadier Robert Marsh, who headed up our Victorian flood assistance task force. These Defence Force Army personnel and the men and women who worked with them did a terrific job.I just draw attention to one particular aspect of that contribution. Whilst very many of us saw Army, Navy and Air Force personnel out there literally mopping up - and I make this point advisedly - when Australians see Defence Force personnel out on the streets helping out, not only do they know that the Commonwealth and the Defence Force are doing the right thing; it also fills them with a great deal of confidence that at a time of urgent need Defence Force personnel are out there helping out.The one instance I want to draw particular attention to is Army, Navy and Air Force personnel engaged in the aftermath of the flash flood and storm through the Lockyer Valley in Toowoomba evacuating over 400 people to the Forest Hill evacuation centre in conditions described by experienced pilots as some of the worst weather they have ever taken to the air in. I think this is a massively underappreciated act of great heroism that is worthy of again placing on record.Most of us appreciate the great work that the Australian Defence Force do when it comes to, if you like, their core business - military, defence and national security issues. But occasionally we see the second great arm of the work that they have done consistently and throughout all of their period as the Australian Defence Force - disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. Often we see that as a response by a civilised country, Australia, wanting to be a good international citizen in areas in our region, whether it is an earthquake in Indonesia or a tsunami in Samoa or Tonga. Occasionally we see it on our own shores, as with the floods and the cyclones this year and the Victorian bushfires a year or so ago. It is a contribution individually and collectively that is massively appreciated by the people in distress, massively appreciated by the Australian people and deeply appreciated by members of this House.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much for that question. It allows me to address what I think has become quite an inappropriate argument that has been running in parts of Queensland when, of course, so much attention should and will urgently be given to the rebuilding of hospitals and other services that I think have been coping extremely well in difficult circumstances. At the start of his question the member asked what the point is of building these services. The point of building these services is that unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition left 60 per cent of the country short of GPs, meaning that not just in times of crisis but also in the middle of the night and on weekends, when families want their children to get care and see a GP, they have not been able to do so. It is not correct that an assessment was not made by the government of the areas of need; it is correct that that work was not done by our department.If the member wants to say to me that his community of Townsville does not want a superclinic, there are many, many other communities across the country that desperately want one. We have made it absolutely clear that if any community clearly indicates to us that they do not want a superclinic - and local members are welcome to do this; they have all been written to - I am quite happy to have that money redirected to communities that do desperately need them and make sure that our commitment that people can see a GP close to home when they need one will be realised by the work of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and note the tremendous assistance that she and indeed other members of this House have given to constituents affected by the natural disasters that have affected the Australian population during this summer period. Literally hundreds of thousands of Australians have been impacted. We are well aware, from the debate yesterday and from the member's personal accounts, of the impact of the floods in Queensland and Cyclone Yasi. Extensive flooding also occurred in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia. Western Australia received extensive flooding at Carnarvon in December, severe storms and, just this week, severe bushfires with some 60 homes destroyed and 30 seriously damaged. In fact, the area now covered by natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements in Australia exceeds the area of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Spain and Portugal combined.Of course, substantial preparations went into the season. We had noticed that it was going to be a bad year for the second time. Emergency Management Australia conducted pre-season briefings but this time they did it on a localised basis assisted by Geoscience Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology, the defence forces and human services. For the first time, they commissioned emergency management liaison officers from the Commonwealth, with state emergency responders, and they were in turn able to call on assistance and liaison officers from other agencies.Financially, there has been massive relief. The Prime Minister has indicated that to date there have been in the order of 357,000 claims under the Australian government disaster recovery payments totalling some $421 million and 38,000 Australians or thereabouts are receiving disaster income recovery subsidies right around Australia totalling some $19 million. But, as the Treasurer has indicated, when the full extent of natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements are implemented, that bill, including the reconstruction of infrastructure right around Australia, will be in the order of billions of dollars.These events have been significant. This Friday I have called an extraordinary meeting of emergency management ministers from the various states and territories around Australia. We will be receiving a debriefing from each of the ministers regarding the impact in their state or territory and conducting an initial assessment of the impact of these natural disasters and the response. But also, significantly, we will be sitting down to plan future directions in respect of emergency management policy development. We think that exercise will be of benefit to the Council of Australian Governments meeting next week, chaired, of course, by the Prime Minister, which will be developing a whole-of-government national resilience strategy.These events have been devastating. Regrettably, they are part of our natural environment, but can I assure all members that the federal government is committed to providing every reasonable assistance to individuals, to businesses and to communities who have been affected and, significantly, is taking all necessary action in partnership with our governments around Australia to increase the capacity of resilience of local communities, to minimise the impact of these natural disasters and to bounce back after they inevitably occur.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I am very happy to answer it and, as I answer it, to clear up what is clearly becoming a set of misapprehensions on behalf of the opposition which I do not think we should allow to run unchallenged. The guidelines under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements are the same guidelines operated by the Howard government. They are the guidelines that the Leader of the Opposition called on me just before Christmas to make sure applied to natural disasters this summer. So any question about the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements guidelines we are operating are the very guidelines the Leader of the Opposition called on me to have for natural disasters this summer. I know consistency of purpose is not the Leader of the Opposition's strong suit, so if he has changed his mind - other than on the question of additional assistance for people in Cyclone Larry that he has raised in parliament today and raised in the Sunday newspapers - generally about the architecture of natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements and he now believes, as the questioning of his members would seem to imply, that they should extend to meeting all losses sustained by every business and every householder then the Leader of the Opposition should say that, we will have it costed for him and he should nominate matching savings. I think he is going to find that pretty hard to do. - So let us not hear anything more about natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements other than the call for additional assistance for small businesses as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, unless the Leader of the Opposition articulates what it is and then we will have it costed.On the question asked by the member, the triggering of Australian government disaster relief payments is being operated by the current government in the way it has been operated by governments past. It has never been the practice of the Australian government - under Mr Howard or any other Prime Minister - to trigger those payments for every weather event or natural disaster. It has never been the practice. It always has been the practice of the Australian government to respond with those payments when natural disasters are of a size that the view is formed that it is beyond the capacity of the community and the state to deal with it. There is not one factor that is put into decision making by this government that was not a factor in decision making by the former Howard government. So let us, once again, not listen to an analysis that says somehow we are less generous with AGDRPs than governments past have been.Finally, I have taken questions today about the operation of the levy. I am still waiting for the answer as to why it was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to say a $6 billion levy was necessary to fund his election promises but it is not good enough to have a levy to rebuild Queensland and the nation. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. While his state has been impacted by the flooding, obviously nowhere near the extent to which it has occurred in Queensland and in other states, it nevertheless has had an impact and I have been kept informed by not only the member for Lyons but also the member for Braddon, whose electorate also has been affected. My advice to them has been the same that I have been giving to local governments as I have visited many parts of the devastated sections of this country. I have seen the devastation firsthand and the reality is that we all know there is going to be a massive rebuild required. That rebuild has to be based upon a partnership with the states, which the Prime Minister has referred to. This has been the practice through governments of both persuasions over many years.It is clearly important for those states in this partnership to develop a statement, a strategic indication of the priority projects that need to be replaced. In doing that, they have to adhere to this principle that the Prime Minister has also referred to: value for money. The partnership is one that involves not just governments - and when I say 'governments' I do not just mean us and the states; I mean local government - but the private sector, the not-for-profit organisations and in particular the insurance industry. This is a framework that we as a government are developing. But that framework will be best served if there is local input. We are committed on this side to drive regional development and creative solutions which produce a more efficient outcome, and we want local input. It is important for us all in terms of the path forward to ensure that the strategic partnership I talk of is shaped by that local input.I have had the opportunity in many of the visits that I have made to engage in discussions with not just the mayors of the particular towns affected but the mayors of the surrounding towns and to involve in those discussions representatives of Regional Development Australia, Because we need to get the strategic links with these councils in terms of the infrastructure to be replaced.I said at the outset that the rebuild task is going to be massive; it is. It is going to require new resources as well as creative application of existing programs to see where the reprioritisation and reuse of existing programs does not just meet the task of the rebuild but also addresses the key issues which many areas have raised, and those include better flood-proofing and flood mitigation, the betterment concepts. That is why we do have to be creative.I mention the task of involving new resources. That is why the levy is important. Let's not kid ourselves that this can be done simply through existing programs. I personally believe that existing programs can help, but this is a requirement for the nation to pull together. And that is why this parliament as a whole needs to show to the rebuild the same resolve and cohesion that has been there in the recovery and clean-up. Get behind the levy; support it in the interests of the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and advise her that the arrangements that we will use on recovery beyond that provided by the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements will be to work with the Queensland government and work through the Queensland recovery authority. I believe that is the right mechanism because that is the mechanism that is going to keep us in touch with local communities, including Brisbane City Council. I have met with the lord mayor, and I am well aware that there was public transport infrastructure damage. Like every other Australia I saw the huge walkways floating down the Brisbane River, and I am well aware of that damage too.Obviously the Brisbane City Council, as a big entity, has some capacity itself to deal with rebuilding and recovery, and the lord mayor in his discussions indicated that - that as a very sizeable council they do have capacity to work through a range of issues in a way that many smaller councils would not. But he also indicated to me that he would be in discussions with the Queensland recovery authority about additional assistance that Brisbane might need.Can I say to the House: I do not believe that it is appropriate for me as Prime Minister in this place or indeed any other to walk around picking projects I like the look of and saying, without consultation and working through, 'I will fund this,' or, 'I won't fund that.' That is not the approach I will be taking. That is not the approach that is fiscally responsible. That is not the approach that gets value for money. That is not the approach that best meets local community needs.What we have done instead is worked with the Queensland government. We have made Major General Mick Slater available - he is a very good man, a good Queenslander, a man with a nice touch with communities. Mick Slater as well as the Queensland government will work with local councils and local communities to identify their priorities. Having identified their priorities, we will then work through in proper process with the Queensland government to look at needs, to set priorities and to see what needs to be done first.Can I indicate to members across the parliament - the government, the crossbenchers and the opposition - that will be my approach. That is the responsible approach. That is the best way to rebuild Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I certainly note that sections of the Ipswich Motorway were underwater and the road was closed for some 2½ days at the height of the floods. Fortunately, there has been no major damage to the road and work is back underway on the $2.5 billion upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway.Around 70 per cent of Queensland's road network was badly impacted during the floods. Some 150 major roads were cut. There have been some 2,000 workers out there around the clock making urgent repairs to ensure that Queensland can get moving again. All airports are now back up and running. All ports are back up and operational. All sections of the Bruce Highway, with some speed restrictions, have been re-opened from Brisbane right up to Cairns. Passenger train services in South-East Queensland are back up and running. The majority of the freight rail network, with the notable exception of the Toowoomba line and some in the north, is up and running.This progress of course costs money, and you have to find the finances from somewhere. It also requires leadership, which requires putting the national interest first, above opportunistic political considerations. That is why this government has put together the $5.6 billion funding package to help with the recovery. It includes a $2 billion upfront payment to Queensland to help with the immediate clean-up and rebuilding efforts. We have taken action. We will rebuild infrastructure. We needed to prioritise those immediate needs.Only weeks ago the opposition agreed with this. The shadow minister said on 18 January, 'We want to be able as a nation to commit to more infrastructure but some of them are still a long way from starting, so maybe something can be done in the interim with the funding earmarked.' The Leader of the Opposition said on the same day, 'Let's face it: the government is going to have to focus on the urgent, unavoidable and necessary repair work.' That is precisely what we are doing. Those opposite continue to put their political interest ahead of the national interest. This is a time when Australians need a hand up. But the Leader of the Opposition has had his hand out for political donations to the Liberal Party and could not even answer the question -  - Absolutely, Mr Speaker. Responses to the floods are a matter of one's judgment as to whether one is prepared to put the national interest first. Those on this side of the House are doing just that. We will be doing that when we introduce the flood levy legislation tomorrow. I call upon those opposite to improve their judgment, which has been pretty poor of late, and get on with the business of assisting this government to help rebuild Queensland.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that when I met the Indian foreign minister in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago I reaffirmed that the position of the Australian government is that we are not in a position to sell uranium to India as they do not meet the Australian government requirement with respect to ratification of the United Nations Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and in terms of entering into a bilateral agreement with Australia, on the basis of which we sell uranium to countries.I have said previously that I am very supportive of the actions of the United States and their engagement with the international community with respect to the additional accountability of India in terms of their civil nuclear facilities and the willingness of a variety of countries, through the Nuclear Suppliers Group, to actually supply uranium to India. That is not new. It has been acknowledged by me and by other ministers that, in terms of the actions of countries beyond Australia who are capable of selling uranium to India, the leadership of the United States, in association with other countries, is to be commended.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Fighting terrorism has long been a bipartisan position in this parliament. Since the Bali bombings of 2002 that bipartisan commitment has had a particular application to Indonesia, given our concerns about the risk of militant Islamism in Indonesia, particularly the ability of militant Islamism to penetrate the Indonesian education system. That is why, in 2005, with complete bipartisan support from the then opposition, then Prime Minister Mr Howard announced a program, the Australia Indonesia Basic Education Program, in order to deal with this challenge. We supported it. It provided some $387 million for a range of measures, including 330,000 new places for junior secondary school kids in Indonesia - a good measure. On top of that there was the construction and extension of more than 2,000 new junior secondary schools in Indonesia. That is a good measure. Also, that program extended to more than 500 Islamic schools in Indonesia - a further good measure.On the question of the efficiency and effectiveness of this program - and the Leader of the Opposition might listen to this - it was reviewed not just once but on two occasions, most recently in May 2010. The review report completed at the end of the program said that it was an efficient and effective program against the targets set for it. It further made 14 recommendations, of which the government has embraced 13, and partially the 14th.Based on this report the Prime Minister announced recently in Indonesia that we would extend this program into the future to cover the 2010-15 program. This would involve a further 2,000 junior secondary school places - again, a good measure. It also involved an additional investment to support something like 293,000 school principals and other officials - every school principal in Indonesia - being trained in school management programs, thereby affecting some 50 million kids in the education system.This is a good program as well, building on the good program which preceded it. In fact we supported Mr Howard's decision to do this. Alexander Downer, with whom I have often had a unity ticket on these questions in the past, said that it is an:,,, incredibly important way we contribute to the counterterrorism effort.I note for the record that his replacement in the seat of Mayo also said this morning that the program should be retained for the reason that it contributed directly to Australia's domestic security.I am asked about risk to the program. The risk to the program lies in the rash policy judgment of the Leader of the Opposition. He said yesterday that this program had not been reviewed. Wrong. It has been reviewed on two occasions, the most recent of which he would have seen, if he had done any policy homework, is up on the departmental website. He said yesterday that this program in the past was designed exclusively for Aceh. Wrong again. It applied to the entire Indonesian archipelago.There would perhaps be one person in the word who would be happy with the new policy adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, and that is Abu Bakar Bashir, because he supports militant Islamism continuing in the Indonesian education system. The Leader of the Opposition has put partisan politics ahead of the national interest. Our foreign aid policy is based on prosecuting Australia's national interest, our national security interest, our economic interests and our international humanitarian interests.

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to explain something he clearly does not seem to understand. First and foremost, the government's budget is composed of money that has been given to the government by taxpayers, and we take that trust very seriously. Because we take that trust very seriously, when we make decisions about the use of government funds, we make them properly and appropriately, having considered all of the needs. That is how we have approached the flood package to rebuild Queensland and rebuild the nation; that is, for every $1 we are asking Australian taxpayers to pay to the government through the levy we have identified $2 in savings.It is no mystery to me that the Leader of the Opposition misunderstands these things, because every time he comes to look at budget questions it ends in disaster. It ended in an $11 billion black hole last year and this week it has ended up in a profound division on his frontbench, with even his most senior colleagues, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, believing he has got it wrong in terms of the choice of the cutbacks that he announced earlier this week.I understand that Australians are under cost-of-living pressures - I do understand that. The government tries to work with Australian families to help with those pressures. That is why we provided the family tax payments system and why we can add to it to provide additional assistance for teenagers. That is why we provided the childcare tax rebate arrangements - and why it remains true that every user of child care is better off under this government than they were when the Leader of the Opposition sat on the government benches. That is why we created the education tax rebate and why we will add to it to enable people to deal with the cost of school uniforms. It is why we engaged in a historically large rise in our pensions - because we knew that pensioners were doing it tough. And the list goes on. But, understanding those cost-of-living pressures, we also believe it is right, at a time that the nation faces the kinds of challenges we see from the summer of disaster that we have just lived through, to ask Australians to make a contribution too. We believe it is right to do that.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I am still waiting for an answer to my question: why is it that he could support levies in the past, that he designed his election policies based on a $6 billion levy, that it was good enough for him to seek to levy $6 billion for his election policies, but it is not good enough for him to support a levy to rebuild Queensland and rebuild the nation? The Leader of the Opposition has no philosophical objections to levies. We know that. He has supported them in the past and he has designed them himself. Now is the time to step forward and to show some leadership. I am still calling on the Leader of the Opposition to find it within himself to look beyond political interest at the national interest, and that requires supporting the package the government has outlined for a $5.6 billion expenditure on rebuilding.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The member who asked the question has an electorate very severely impacted upon by the recent floods. I had the opportunity to spend some time with him in his electorate. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to visit an evacuation centre overseen by Pastor Mark Edwards. I received a very nice email from that pastor about the visit and I want to take this opportunity to record my appreciation to him for the things that he did to assist frail, aged Australians and others during the days of intensity flooding, when people were not able to stay in their residential aged care facility.The package I have outlined as Prime Minister is the right package for this nation. We are facing a national disaster. It is a national challenge and it is a national responsibility, so it is my judgment that we should work together and respond as a nation. This is a huge disaster. A quick run through the figures tells you that. We believe it requires at least $5.6 billion. It has knocked half a per cent off economic growth. We have responded with the biggest deployment of the ADF for a natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy. We could have taken the soft options and not worried about capacity constraints in the economy. We could have taken the soft option of not doing the right thing by the national economy. Instead, we have stepped up to the hard decision to bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13 because that is what our economy will require. When your economy is strong you pay as you go.We have taken the hard decision to defer infrastructure because there are only so many skilled Australians that can be brought to the rebuilding task. It makes sense to take pressure off to deal with those capacity constraints - the hard decision of deferring a billion dollars in infrastructure. But that has been the right thing to do. And we have taken the hard decision to ask Australians to support their fellow Australians through a levy. That, also, is the right thing to do. Let me say to the House that when you look at the progressive design of this levy, almost half of the money raised by it will come from those Australians fortunate enough to earn over $200,000. Now that, I think, is an important statistic for the House to understand.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that now is the time to put aside his petty politicking and to endorse this package. He has failed in the task of generating alternative savings and we have seen the splits in his political party as a result. Look at the words of the member for Mayo who has rejected the raiding of foreign aid and has indicated that a program important to our own domestic security has been cut - a position endorsed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Look at the words of the member for Hasluck who has said that within a budget there is some capacity, but we have to look at all the options and to take a hard line that is counter-productive to the process is problematic. They are wise words from the member for Hasluck and the Leader of the Opposition should listen to them. It is time that he stepped up and put the national interest before his narrow political interest. That is what Australians are looking to him to do.</DOC>

 - It is because there is no contradiction. Bringing the budget back to surplus, keeping our public finances strong - particularly when there are capacity constraints in the economy - is the rock of good economic management. We have to preserve our fiscal firepower if there are more events down the track. These are the basics of very strict fiscal discipline and the basics of sending a message to markets that this economy is strong, that our public finances are strong and that we can handle adverse events. Of course there is no contradiction. Those opposite are simply embarrassed. It was good enough for them when they were in government to introduce six levies. For the leader of this opposition to come into this House and stand up year after year after year -  - I was asked about the need for a levy - why we needed to put this levy in place. I am explaining. It is to keep our budget in surplus, to keep our public finances strong and, importantly, to rebuild Queensland because, unlike those opposite, we will not put political interests before the national interests.I do not doubt that bringing in a levy like this can be unpopular, but I can tell you this: it is the right thing to do by Queensland and it is the right thing to do by Australia. Those opposite are taking the opportunistic path that they took during the last election campaign: putting their political interests before the national interest. All of those members over there from Queensland are acutely embarrassed by the stance of those opposite. They are going to feel the heat from their electorates because putting this levy in place to rebuild Queensland -  - to rebuild Far North Queensland and to rebuild North Queensland is absolutely in the national interest. If it was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to go around Australia during the last election campaign and argue the case for a permanent levy then surely it is good enough for the opposition to support a temporary levy to rebuild Queensland and parts of Victoria. This just shows they are putting their political interests ahead of the national interest. - As I said in this House yesterday, it is all opposition and no leadership.</DOC>

 - It is my pleasure to tell the House about today's employment figures. Today's labour force figures show there are more people in work and more people looking for work. These figures are quite good. They show that in the month of January, which of course had the natural disasters - the Queensland floods and now the cyclones - that our economy created an additional 24,000 jobs. That builds on the creation of 364,000 jobs in 2010. That is the biggest calendar-year increase in our history. It is something that the parliament ought to be proud of - to have had this employment outcome given the global economic conditions that we have seen in the last couple of years in this country. This government always puts jobs first and always puts the community first.We have seen an unemployment rate of five per cent. We have seen a slight increase in the participation rate to 65.9 per cent. This figure, more than anything else, confirms the fundamental strength of the Australian economy. Yes, there has been an impact in Queensland. There is no doubt about that. And even in these figures you can see that hours worked were down in Queensland and there has been an impact. But what Australians can have faith in is the fact that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. And on top of that, we have got a very strong investment pipeline - ABARE estimates $380 billion in resources alone. And we are returning to surplus faster than any major advanced economy. I think the Australian people are proud of these figures. We have bounced back before, as we did during the global recession, and we will bounce back from the impacts of these natural disasters.Over the past three years there have been something like 740,000 jobs created in Australia and, during that period, something like 30 million jobs were shed elsewhere in the world. This government took the tough decisions during the global financial crisis to stimulate our economy, to support jobs, to support small business, to support tradies and to keep our communities strong. And just as we did that during the global crisis, we are doing it through these natural disasters - taking the right decisions for Australia, keeping our public finances strong, but providing the necessary resources that are required to rebuild communities. We certainly do not underestimate the scale of the task before us, and that is why we moved so quickly to make the savings in the budget and put in place a modest levy.And through all of that we have been opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. He opposed everything we did to protect our communities during the global financial crisis. If he had had his way, this economy would have gone into recession. And now he is opposing our plans to rebuild Queensland, to get the appropriate resources in the right place to help those shattered communities rebuild. Nothing could be more important to the peace of mind of those communities than to know that the government has a responsible plan which can be funded. Of course, as usual the Leader of the Opposition puts his political interests ahead of the national interest. It would have been easy for us to say: 'She'll be right. We won't do anything about this. We won't put a levy in place. We'll fudge it like the opposition always does.' But this government is doing the right thing by Australia, the right thing by our economy and the right thing for those communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the member well knows, we operate a mandatory detention system and, yes, there are costs associated with it. Those costs were met by the former Howard government - in the region of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars - in order to fund the so-called Pacific solution. We have taken a different approach but we have maintained mandatory detention. Yes, it does cost money, but it is the right policy for this country and, as a result, we will continue to fund it. I am not sure whether the member, in asking his question, is suddenly of the view that mandatory detention should be abandoned as a policy. I know that he has flipped and flopped in many directions on immigration policy since the last election, but mandatory detention remains the policy of this government and consequently we will fund it.What arises as a result of the member's question is that, yes, budgets require choices - and they are not easy choices. We need to keep working to make those choices. We have made those choices in our $5.6 billion funding package. The choices have not been easy. Finding two dollars of cuts for every dollar we are asking Australians to put in for the levy and deferring a billion dollars of infrastructure programs have been difficult decisions, but they are the right decisions in the national interest. The member who asked me the question sits on the frontbench of an opposition that has been unable to make these decisions. The Leader of the Opposition said: 'All of this is going to be easy. I'll be able to find this money in the budget.' And then we waited day after day after day for a funding package to be produced. And when it was produced, so hollow was it, so shallow was it, that it did not even enjoy the support of his deputy leader; so hollow was it, so shallow was it, that the backbench are out on the doors basically saying they do not support it either.The member who asked the question also asked me about the Bruce Highway, and I thank him for that. We have allocated $2.3 billion to the Bruce Highway over six years. The Howard government allocated $1.2 billion over 12 years. Let's do that maths again: $2.3 billion over six years versus $1.2 billion over 12 years. We have effectively doubled the effort in half the time. So, if the member wants to come to the dispatch box and say, 'Yes, the Howard government was remiss. Yes, it was a government of poor choices,' and then say, 'This government has made better choices,' that would be an accurate reflection of the facts.But, of course, the facts will not ever cross the lips of those opposite, because this is about their political interest, not about the national interest. It is time they lifted their sights. It is time they recognised this nation has come through a summer of natural disaster. The nation needs rebuilding. We have a plan to rebuild it. It is time to stop the cheap politicking and endorse our plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I do think I should take this opportunity to record my objection to the beard too - it is something I have said to him face to face. I do not know what has happened over the summer season, but we have Rob Oakeshott here and Dennis Shanahan up there and they are both very poor judgment calls, Mr Speaker! We will see what happens by the time the parliament sits next.On the important question of health, I can assure the member that, when COAG meets in the coming few days and I sit with premiers and chief ministers from around the nation to talk about health, I will be centrally guided by the principles of equity and efficiency that he points to. When we look at our healthcare system, as a nation we face a profound challenge of rapidly escalating healthcare costs. We face a profound challenge where currently, under the arrangements we have known to date, the level of government most exposed to those rapidly escalating healthcare costs is the level of government least able to efficiently raise the additional moneys required. We know that if we leave that undisturbed over the long term it will ultimately overwhelm the revenue-raising capacity of states.Of course, as states come to this task they are trying to build on the foundations left by the Leader of the Opposition, which included a $1 billion cutback to hospitals and insufficient investment in the health workforce, so we are short of doctors, short of nurses and short of the dedicated professionals that go to make a healthcare system. But we need now to grasp this reform challenge. Clearly some great work has been done to date, but there is more to do and I am hoping that, in the coming few days, I can, in the national interest, strike agreements with premiers and with chief ministers.I know that the member who asked the question is always very concerned about spatial fairness - the fairness between urban Australia and rural and regional Australia - when it comes to the allocation of healthcare funds and health efforts. I know he is very concerned about statistics like the cancer rates, which show survivability from cancer is lower in rural and regional Australia. I can assure him that these things are at the heart of what I am thinking about as we work through these reforms. In addition, I can assure him that efficiency - activity based funding drivers that actually make sure our healthcare dollar goes where it can do the most good and work the hardest - is also at the centre of the reform agenda of the government. I thank him for the question. It is a very important issue and I hope by the time the House next meets I will be in a position to advise him of what I am very much determined should be successful outcomes from COAG.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for the question. Over the last few days in water reform we have had some constructive suggestions and we have had some negligent suggestions that have come from various quarters. I want to thank the members of both sides of the House who have been working with the member for New England in the inquiry that has been taking place into reform of the Murray-Darling Basin and share some suggestions and feedback that have been passed on to me from that inquiry.The information that has come is very much matching what I have been receiving in the consultations that I have been conducting in irrigation communities. I should inform the House that the concept that has been referred to me from the committee about trying to improve the management of environmental assets is a very real possibility in trying to minimise the adjustment required for individual communities. I am currently looking at ways of formalising a process with stakeholders to come up with the best projects that might be able to deal with that. Similarly, issues have been put to me from the committee about wanting to maximise the opportunity for strategic purchases, and that is very much linked with the recommendation that has come from them regarding taxation issues. The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and the Treasurer have been working with me on trying to find a way of maximising the tax effectiveness of those strategic purchases, and we are certainly very hopeful that we will be able to make an announcement on that soon which I think will very much meet the wishes of the committee.There have also been some suggestions that could not be described as being quite so constructive. It was suggested by the opposition that, as an alternative to Australians contributing through the flood levy, we would stop the buyback of water in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is true that buyback, even though it was technically funded by the previous government, was something that they never delivered on. They established the office of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and then gave the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder no water to hold at all. I notice some members around have glasses of water at their desks. There is more water in those glasses than was ever purchased by the previous government for environmental water to restore the Murray-Darling to health. That puts at a disadvantage all the irrigators who have actually invested in improving their infrastructure and who then want to put the water that they no longer require on the market. But, when they want to do it, this mob opposite are saying that, if they were in government, they would not assist with that. They are saying that that would not be available in the repurchase of environmental water.This is a great victory for Senator Joyce over every South Australian member opposite, because the South Australian members on this side, including the member for Makin, know exactly what the last drought looked like. They know exactly what it looks like when you get acid sulfate soils. They know what it looks like when the Lower Lakes become a bed of salinity. They know what it looks like when you allow the rivers to run dry because of overallocation. But every South Australian member opposite has been defeated in a campaign by Senator Joyce to try to stop the reform of the Murray-Darling Basin.Do not forget what that means for irrigators, because if you do not engage year after year in a strategic, voluntary buyback from people who have chosen to put their water on the market then you have only eight years before the final state water plans come into place, and that means the opposition have created a situation where, by being negligent in buyback in the coming years, they would land Australians in a situation of potential compulsory acquisition in eight years time. If you do not engage in the buyback in a strategic way, the concept of willing sellers completely falls off the table. Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has once again put his political interests ahead of the national interest. He does not believe in water reform.

 - I thank the member for his question, and I would ask him to pass on my congratulations to the volunteer that he mentions. This House, of course, congratulated, through the contributions that people made on the condolence motion, the many thousands - the tens of thousands; indeed, the hundreds of thousands - of people who went to the assistance of others to deal with these natural disasters and to clean up from them. It has been a fantastic display of Australian mateship. It has been a fantastic display of the Australian way.As we look at that fantastic display, we would also remember the people who could not physically be there but who sent donations to the Premier's disaster relief fund - the mums and dads who put some money in. Now that disaster relief fund is at $200 million. But I would say to the member: I applaud those efforts, but I also understand, as I believe Australians do generally understand, that the $200 million that they raised and the efforts they went to as volunteers go to help another human being. But I think they also understand the nation needs to rebuild from this. We are not talking about something that can be paid for by voluntary donations. Two hundred million dollars is an incredible amount of money for people to raise, but we are talking about needing a sum of at least $5.6 billion to rebuild, and that is before we get to the damage that has been caused by the cyclone - and we have all seen that devastation on our TV screens.So as a nation, in the national interest, we have to ask ourselves: how do we best do this? I have said to the nation that we best do this by making savings on the Commonwealth budget that stand up to rigorous scrutiny. That is the difference between the savings that I have outlined and the savings the Leader of the Opposition has outlined. And I have said to the nation that we should ask those Australians with capacity to contribute to contribute in the interests of their fellow Australians. That is what the levy is, and that is why 60 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay less than $1 a week.I say to the member who has asked the question, who is new to this place: levies have happened before. They happened before when the nation needed to buy back guns following the dreadful incident we saw at Port Arthur. The nation has levied before; levied to support the milk industry and the sugar industry in their adaptation to change. We have levied before to support Ansett workers when that airline collapsed. The former Prime Minister, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, asked the nation to contribute through a levy to the costs of assisting East Timor. These things have happened at times in our history when it has been right to say to Australians, 'Can you give a hand to help?' That is what I am saying to Australians now; that is what I will continue to say to Australians - that is the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. Indeed, his electorate is one of those that has been impacted. In Victoria, over 65 arterial roads and more than 270 local roads have been closed due to flooding. Larger roads, such as the Calder and the Sturt highways have been cut off. I have been advised that many roads are still under water and damage is still being assessed. I have had a number of conversations with the Victorian transport minister, and yesterday I had another conversation with the Premier of Victoria, Mr Baillieu, as well about these issues.Certainly, it is the case that the rebuilding will take time, but it will also cost money. It requires national leadership and a national approach. We on this side of the House have made the judgment that a national crisis and a national disaster require national leadership. That is what we have determined; that is our judgment. So we have to pay for it from somewhere.We have paid for it with a $1.8 billion flood levy. We have also deferred some projects and, indeed, one of the deferrals that occurred was $20 million for the Princes Highway east in Gippsland. This was a road that was also impacted by some environmental assessments. We sat down with the respective state governments, identified projects that were potentially not going to be able to proceed and freed up that capacity. There is a limited amount of capital equipment in the country and there is a limited amount of skills. The priority is rebuilding those areas that have been affected.I welcome the comments of the member for Gippsland, who said today or yesterday, 'I think the people of Gippsland will understand the reason for it. There is a major rebuilding effort required right across Queensland and northern Victoria, so I think people understand the need for reprioritising of the government's funding.' I thank him for those comments. He was talking about the $20 million deferral of the Princes Highway east that the government announced, one of the nine projects that we have deferred.I was surprised by the tone in the question asked before about the Bruce Highway because, consistent with that, obviously the member for Gippsland had seen the comments of the Leader of the Opposition on 18 January:Let's face it _ the Government was going to have to focus on the urgent, unavoidable and necessary repair work, _They called for deferrals to occur, then they opposed them. The leader of the National Party put out a media release opposing the deferrals of the Queensland projects that have been worked out with the Queensland government as being unable to proceed. But have a look at their detail, because they did not put them all back in. They put three back in the other day, and when they did that the Leader of the Opposition in his response spoke about capacity constraints in the economy as a reason for some of the other cuts that were made. I think that the inconsistency is there.The fact is that we are still spending double the amount of money in half the time on the Bruce Highway than the previous government did.

 - I thank the member for his question. I understand that when you go to the Australian community and say to some members of the community, 'We are going to ask you to pay some more,' that that is not necessarily popular. I understand that.I understood that when I made the decision that we would have this levy. I understood it was very likely that for days and days we would see talkback radio rage, television stations conducting phone-in polls and that the quick conclusion by many would be that the community was opposed. I expected all of that, but I also thought, and I absolutely believe now, that Australians will accept that it is the right thing to do, to step forward at a time like this and to assist their fellow Australians.I am making the same judgment call that Prime Minister Howard made when he proposed the gun buyback, that Prime Minister Howard made when he proposed the East Timor levy, that Prime Minister Howard made when he proposed the various industry restructuring funds, that Prime Minister Howard made when he proposed the Ansett levy and that Prime Minister Howard made when he proposed the levy on superannuation. I am making the same judgment call that there are some times in a nation's history when the right thing to do is to ask the community to put in some more.Who is being asked to put in some more? No-one who earns under $50,000 a year is being asked. Taxpayers who earn over $50,000 a year and less than $60,000 a year are being asked for less than a dollar a week. Someone on $80,000 a year is being asked for less than a cup of coffee. The levy does rise and it does hit higher income earners and so it should. Almost half of the money raised from this levy will come from those fortunate enough to earn over $200,000 a year. Almost 40 per cent of it will come from those earning over $300,000 a year. We will ask Australians to make an additional contribution -  - I say to the member who asked the question I agree with him it would have been wrong to say to Australians, 'Shoulder this burden entirely through a levy.' So we have not done that. For every dollar we will ask Australians to contribute to this levy, we have found $2 in savings or deferrals in the federal government budget - not easy decisions. The Leader of the National Party interjected before about infrastructural deferrals. The single biggest infrastructure deferral actually affects my electorate - not easy decisions, but the right decisions in the national interest.You can come to this place and say, 'I will always look to do what's popular,' or you can come to this place and say, 'I'm determined to do what's right.' On this side of the chamber we are determined to do what is right. We ask the Leader of the Opposition just once - just one vote on one occasion - to set aside his political interests and to vote in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question about the insurance claims of flood affected victims. I know that the member for Oxley and many members on both sides of the House have been pursuing the interests of their electorates who had insurance claims following the floods.What happens with insurance after a flood is that many Australians who do not always like paying insurance but have paid it year in, year out expect their insurance companies to stand beside them when disaster strikes - and quite rightly so. What has been happening in the recent floods - and many members on both sides have been at pains to alert the government to this - is that in many cases insurance companies have stepped up to the massive deluge of claims. In the case of the Queensland floods alone, there have been 40,000 claims. In the case of Cyclone Yasi, there have been 5,000 claims so far. In the case of the fires in Western Australia, there have been 500 and in the case of the flooding in Victoria there have been nearly 5,000 claims. Despite handling the bulk of the claims, it has become clear to the government that there are some longstanding issues which have not been addressed in a policy sense which compromise and affect the ability of insured people to recover and get on with their lives.I go to the issue of the definition of flood - the plain English meaning in contracts - and the use of fine print to defeat people's otherwise legitimate claims. This government has, since 5 January, immediately after the Rockhampton flood, met with the insurance industry. It has, in working with the state governments and legal groups, made legal services available for the insured to be able to claim. It has put in place the capacity for the insurance industry to have a panel of hydrologists to make sure that technical experts can get on and make the claims as quickly as possible and assess their validity. But what we are seeing - and I know members on both sides of the House have raised this issue - is that in some cases some companies are relying upon the fine print to avoid honouring their obligations.We have seen some insurance companies provide river flood coverage and get on with life, including Suncorp, and we have seen RACQ and Comminsure step forward to provide payments to policyholders without deciding the issue of flood insurance. We also need to see other companies stepping forward and resolving once and for all a proper plain English definition of flood coverage. It is not too hard, in the government's opinion, for the insurance industry to work with consumer groups and the regulators to come up with clear definitions of what is a flood.There are different definitions. In the Wagga floods of 2009 in New South Wales, it turned out that insurance companies were using 11 different definitions of floods. This is a very difficult area for consumers to seek justice. I am aware of claims where claimants have adjusted their house and the insurance companies have then tried to say that the whole policy is void. I am aware of different companies taking different attitudes to the cause of flood damage in some of the flood affected regions. I acknowledge the work of not only the member for Oxley and the member for Blair but indeed the member for Wright and the member for Groom in chasing down insurance companies who were being recalcitrant in the definition of flood damage and seeking consistency amongst the companies.Where we go from here is that in the next few weeks the insurance industry has committed to developing one definition of floods across all insurance products. This is a step forward which has not happened in the past. In addition, the insurance industry has agreed that - perhaps not breaking any barriers of rocket science but to the satisfaction of consumers - there should be a plain English explanation on one page of what homeowners are insured for.There are many more issues in resolving adequate insurance coverage in the future for the next natural disaster, and we will work on those issues, too, but I can report to the House that the insurance industry, at the prompting of the government, accepts that it has to lift its performance. At the same time, I can report that the insurance industry is handling the vast bulk of these claims in a timely fashion. This government will keep its work going.

 - I can explain that. In the construction of buildings under the Building the Education Revolution, whether they be halls, whether they be classrooms, whether they be libraries or whether they be something purpose generated for that school, the construction was done to the standard under the relevant school authority's guidelines. So, if it was in a state school, it was constructed under the state school guidelines. If it was in a Catholic school, it was constructed under the Catholic guidelines. If it was constructed in an independent school, the school itself determined what the guidelines were. If the member thinks those guidelines are inappropriate in a local school, he would need to raise that with the relevant local authorities.What I can say to the member - which I think, given the part of the world he represents, he would be very interested in - is that, of course, as part of economic stimulus the government did build in Cairns the disaster management facility to category 5 cyclone standard. It was then used in the management of the cyclone that has just occurred. It was, in fact, where the emergency service personnel and the people who needed to coordinate in such difficult and dangerous circumstances gathered. Others went there, too, for shelter during such a ferocious cyclone. So, in terms of providing shelters that have been of use, the member would be aware of one constructed in his local community through economic stimulus - economic stimulus wholly opposed by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Moreton for that question and tell him and the House that this week I spoke to a lady in his electorate, Maureen Machin, who is a 51-year-old former Queensland Rail worker who lived on her own with three little dogs. She was ringing to thank us for the $1,000 payment that she received. She was telling me about getting her little dogs safely out of her home and to the local petrol station, going back to try to get some stuff out of her house and finding out she could not salvage anything. She had to swim out of her home. She dog paddled across a two-metre-high back fence and she was washed down the road. She ended up in the night, in stinking water, carried along by the flood, in the QEII stadium evacuation centre, which is in the member's electorate. She was there for about a week. Centrelink workers tracked her down and encouraged her to apply for the payment. She had not initially realised she was eligible, but the Centrelink workers doing their outreach found her and encouraged her to apply. They helped her fill in the form. She used that $1,000 to pay for her immediate needs: food, clothing, a phone so she could contact friends to reassure them she was okay and medicine for one of her sick little dogs who are her only companions. She said: 'I felt blessed. There was an acknowledgement that people were down. I felt like someone had a hand on my shoulder, saying, 'Keep on going.' Your needs become very basic when you've lost everything.'As well as the QEII stadium where the Centrelink workers were - there were 13 staff there - there were other staff in recovery centres at the Yeronga State School and St Aidan's Anglican Girls School in Corinda. The previous member asked about BER school halls. I am happy to inform him that the member for Moreton has told me that both of those recovery centres were in BER school halls. Of course, over 100,000 people in the Brisbane local government area which covers Moreton have benefited from the payments paid through Centrelink. More than 20,000 of those were for children. They are part of the half-million payments that have been made across the country, most of those within two days of claiming, so that people have some money to buy something to eat; to pay for a motel room; to buy necessities, clothes and a mobile phone so they can stay in touch with people.I heard from another fellow. Barry Kopernik and his wife, Raelene, in Rockhampton who told me that they spent every dollar of their payment within one kilometre of their home. It is not just paying for the basics that they needed but also injecting money back into the local community, supporting local businesses that need that support more than ever. I am happy to report that Phillip Coorey, with his normal perspicacity, described the government's response to the floods as, 'The flawless roll-out of a disaster plan, including emergency Centrelink payments and mobilisation of the military'. Indeed, Centrelink aimed to and, I believe, was successful in supporting Australians when they needed it - supporting them during a time of national disaster as all Australians want to help during this national disaster.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. What I would say to the member is that we have structured the flood levy through the taxation system, so the taxation system obviously does work. It looks at what people earn during a financial year and consequently it is calibrated with income. That is the right thing to do. That is how we structure burdens in our society. We structure burdens on the basis that people who have the capacity to pay more should pay more. In making that design of the flood levy, we did it deliberately so those with additional capacity would pay more.What I would also say to the member is that it does seem to me, as we look at these questions from the opposition, a little bit odd indeed. What people may think, watching this debate, is that we may be looking at two alternate packages to fund the recovery and rebuilding that is necessary around the nation. But, of course, that is not true. There is the government's $5.6 billion package: savings, deferrals and asking Australians for a contribution, with that contribution calibrated against income. So higher income earners pay more. People who earn less than $50,000 a year do not pay anything; people earning $60,000 a year pay less than a dollar a week -  - and people like the shadow Treasurer, who is interjecting at the moment, pay more - as they should. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was talking about financing rebuilding the nation: the government's package of $5.6 billion, including the levy, versus an alternative that simply does not stack up. Indeed, so fragile is it that it is opposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and members of the backbench have been out saying that they do not support elements of it. So the only proposal before the parliament to rebuild the nation -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So there is only one package before the parliament to rebuild the nation. How has the levy been designed? It bears design characteristics like those of the East Timor levy proposed by the Howard government. This is the East Timor levy that the Leader of the Opposition supported.The member has raised with me the question of superannuation, and I can advise him of the following. Lump sum superannuation payments for over 60s from a taxed superannuation fund are exempt from tax and are also exempt from the levy. This covers the vast bulk of superannuants, but people should talk to their superannuation fund about whether a particular payment is untaxed. Can I also say to the member who has asked the question and members opposite that at some point they are going to have to face the decision here. When playing the politics is gone, will they stand up for the national interest? I am being criticised today for not enough exemptions -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am being criticised for not enough exemptions, but the member for Maranoa said this morning that he had been asked by someone in Barcaldine, 'Look, if it is one in, all in, why are some people exempt?' and he is criticising us for too many exemptions. It just goes to show that this is the opposition all over the place again. It just goes to show that criticisms brought to this parliament are all about the politics and not about the interest of Australians. At some point the opposition need to make a decision. Do they stand for the national interest or just for their political interest? We can see the shallow answer on display today.

 - Australia's foreign aid program is designed to support Australia's core national interests: our national economic interest, our national security interest and our international humanitarian interest - and that is precisely what this program in Indonesia does. So what are the contents of what happened under the previous government on this program and what we are proposing to do? Just to refresh honourable members of yesterday's discussion of this, we had 2,075 schools built under the Howard government; we are going to add another 2,000. That is a good news story. Under the Howard government we had assistance to 500-plus Islamic schools; now we are going to add to that with assistance to a further 1,500 Islamic schools. Under the Howard government, 330,000 extra places were created for kids and we are going to add a further 300,000 places for kids. These are good contributions all round. It makes for a good policy.If we wish to look at the human face of what this produces, I draw people's attention to an article by Tom Allard today in the Herald which tells us about little Parhin. This is her photograph - a little girl in East Lombok. Her story is terrific. She has been directly helped by the Howard government program. She has been directly helped because she has had the opportunity to go to secondary school. She has the dream of becoming a doctor. Furthermore, on top of that, in her class, her graduating class, 42 of the 44 kids are going on to high school. Two years ago, about four out of 50 went on to high school. That is what this program is doing on the ground.I have been asked about international and national reactions to this. We see in today's Australian reaction from the Indonesian vice-minister for education. He has called in Australian embassy officials to clarify whether this program will continue. Furthermore, we have officials from the Indonesian education ministry making very clear-cut statements about the value of this program to the future of education in his country. As he says:... we try to educate them - that is, kids in these villages - into a more pluralistic society. Australia is really helping us with education.As for domestic reaction, we have had Alexander Downer come out and bag the decision by the Leader of the Opposition. We have Alex II, the member for Mayo - he has also bagged the decision by the Leader of the Opposition. I am told also that the member for Cook has been out there bagging the Leader of the Opposition's decision. But there is more on today's front-page of the Australian, and that is from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition apparently has had something of a disagreement with the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. To quote from the Australian, she is devastated by Mr Abbott's insistence that the program be sacrificed, and, furthermore, she believed that she had already won the heated debate on foreign aid in the shadow cabinet and is understood to have become embroiled in an 'intense late-night argument with Mr Abbott in which he insisted on deferring the Indonesian schools program'. The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is right on this - absolutely right.The supreme irony is this: here we have the Leader of the Opposition and today we are debating his policy, which is absolutely opposed to sound counterterrorism policy in Indonesia. What is the Indonesian government doing today? It is putting on trial Abu Bakar Bashir in Indonesia for charges concerning terrorism. The Indonesian government is doing the right thing on counterterrorism. The Leader of the Opposition is doing precisely the wrong thing on counterterrorism.</DOC>

 - I believe that the member can be reassured that the rebuilding of Queensland - happening as it will through the Queensland Recovery Authority and through local councils, which is appropriate - will take into account the need for local businesses to be engaged with the rebuilding. If I can pass on a reflection from Victoria, when Victoria rebuilt after the devastating bushfire, one of the things that was discussed in that rebuilding was the need to ensure that the local economy also got the benefits of the money being spent on the rebuild.Can I suggest to the local member the best thing to do? He will very frequently see in his community Major General Mick Slater, who chairs the Queensland Recovery Authority. I have been in communities with him. He has been everywhere and I suspect he will be everywhere on many, many, many occasions. It is the Queensland Recovery Authority that will deal, as necessary, with direct contracting and his local council, the Mission Beach local council, will also deal with direct contracting. Consequently, I would recommend to the member that he have those discussions with Mick Slater when he is available - he will be around Queensland - and with his local council to ensure money flows in his local community as he would desire to see it flow. I also say to the member that, before we get to that stage, you need to be able to finance the rebuilding. You need to be able to put the dollars in, which is why as a government we have announced a package - $5.6 billion - to rebuild the nation. Of course, we are very likely to see those estimates rise, and we need to also meet the reconstruction costs required after the cyclone, which he refers to, which hit Mission Beach.Now, we have to fund that rebuilding. So you have to make some choices here - no lazy choices; no three-word slogans; no quick whiz-around with emails looking for suggestions about what to cut that will actually fix this for you. You have to stump up to the responsibility of making choices. I would say to the member opposite that it seems to me that it will be quite difficult for him to go to a community that has been so hard hit and say that he represents a political party that has been prepared to support a levy to fund its election promises but is not prepared to support a levy to rebuild Queensland. That is the essential choice facing members of this parliament.I believe the member is a person of good will. I would suggest to him that he considers those questions and that he does not follow the Leader of the Opposition blindly down a narrow track of partisan political interests, with the national interest and the interests of Queensland swept to one side.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The fact is that My School has transformed community understanding of school performance, providing the community and parents with information about important areas of schooling, including literacy and numeracy - information that was never before available other than for education bureaucrats and officials. With some 4.6 million visits to the My School site since its launch, it is clearly a matter of great interest to all Australians.Now My School 2.0 will take transparency to a new level, with significant new features. Importantly, financial data on each school will be reported for the first time to everyone to provide a clear picture of the resources that are provided to schools to support the education of students. The collection of this financial data is a complex task and to ensure that it is robust information and comparable, the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority - ACARA - commissioned a detailed validation process undertaken by leading accounting firm, Deloitte. Later in November Deloitte identified an anomaly in the information collected, which could lead to a misstatement of recurrent income for independent schools. Deloitte recommended to ACARA that further validation and consultation take place.On 2 December I announced that My School 2.0 would only be launched after this further validation, and consultation with independent schools, had been undertaken. I also wrote to the ACARA chair requesting a detailed timetable on how outstanding school data issues would be resolved. I can inform the House that over summer ACARA has liaised extensively with individual schools and consulted with the Independent Schools Council and relevant state and territory associations of independent schools because I wanted to make sure that impacted schools had been contacted by ACARA and that they had had time to check their data and understand how the data will be used and reported.I can advise that every independent school in the country has been contacted by ACARA by email. Follow-up contact by telephone has been made when requested and as required and over 900 independent schools now have school finance data reports that have been quality assured by ACARA, Deloitte and my department. These schools are now being given the opportunity to review what their My School finance page will look like because My School 2.0 will also include an enhanced ICSEA - Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage - where the methodology has been improved to provide a more accurate direct measure based on parent education and occupation. It is a case of making good data even better.The change to ICSEA methodology has led to some changes in ICSEA values and less than four per cent of all schools did request a review of their ICSEA value. These schools were given the opportunity to provide more relevant data or information on changed school context. Now schools and systems have had nearly three months to provide the additional data in support of their review request. Information has been considered by the ICSEA expert panel to be satisfied that each school's value is robust based on the most accurate data available.So today, I am pleased to advise that the further work I asked ACARA to do in relation to school data has almost been completed and that My School 2.0 will be ready for release on 4 March. With My School 2.0 ready for release on 4 March the government will deliver an important and fundamental reform - one acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition as worthy of the name 'reform'. Importantly, it is a reform that empowers parents to influence the quality of their child's schooling and empowers education ministers, for the first time, with a national dataset to target school improvement. Importantly, it is a reform that underpins this government's substantial reforms in the area of education. We want to provide every school in Australia with the possibilities of a great education.</DOC>

What I said yesterday is what I stand by, and what I stand by is that I spoke to the lord mayor a number of weeks ago in Brisbane during the flooding crisis. I have spoken to him today and I have, on all occasions, made very clear to him that we will work with his council to rebuild. I have also made clear to him that I will not commit the funding of the Commonwealth using less information than he would view as appropriate if he was making a funding decision sitting at his council as lord mayor.I know the member has sat on that council. I accept that the lord mayor would have sat with her and other councillors and made a wide variety of funding decisions. They would have done that on the basis of information. They would have done it on the basis of likely costs. So I am not taking an approach less rigorous in making decisions about federal government funds than the lord mayor would take approaching his own decision. He would expect to know what the amount is.As it is, the lord mayor indicated to me today that he cannot fully cost the amount yet. He has, following that conversation, sent me a letter with some preliminary figures. In the interests of fiscal rigour, I would obviously not work on the basis of such preliminary figures. We will continue to work through proper processes. - Can I say to the member, on the comparison she makes with the levy, what an absurd comparison. What I said when I announced the $5.6 billion funding package is that we were making room for $5.6 billion, it was against what we knew then about damage, we would make more available as necessary, we needed to find ways to fund it and in order to do that we would make room in the Commonwealth budget through cuts and reprioritising and deferrals and we would ask Australians to make a contribution. That is what I said when I announced the levy. That is what I stand by.I presume it is the position of the member that Brisbane City Council should be treated generously. Well, if she believes that then she has to step up to the political responsibility of saying, 'How do you fund it?' She sits on the backbenches of a political party with no idea about how to do it. Last time they tried to touch budget questions they engaged in an $11 billion black hole, and of course the funding package they have announced is so shaky, so despicable, that even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not endorse it.I would also say to the member who asked me the question, who knows her community well: how is it she campaigned in that community at the last election advocating the paying of a $6 billion levy and now she is not prepared to go to that community and support a levy to rebuild the community? I think community members are going to be asking her some very difficult questions about that. On the question of Brisbane City Council, I await the accurate information.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank my colleague the member for Reid for the question. Many people in the community do want access to independent information to inform them about climate change. Today, to help this need, the government has announced the establishment of the Climate Commission -  - which will allow for independent information for members of the community. There will be a concentration on three areas in particular: firstly, the science of climate change and its impacts on this country; secondly, the progress of international action to reduce emissions; and, thirdly, what a carbon price is and how it interacts with our economy and our communities.I think the membership of the commission is very well suited and qualified to provide this information. Professor Tim Flannery will be the chief commissioner of the commission. As the House knows, he is one of Australia's leading science communicators, with very extensive experience in climate science and conservation, and he was Australian of the Year in 2007. Other members of the commission include well-respected climate scientists Professor Lesley Hughes from Macquarie University and Professor Will Steffen from the Australian National University; Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO of the Australian Science Media Centre; Mr Roger Beale, an economist and former head of the Commonwealth Department of the Environment; and Mr Gerry Hueston, a prominent member of the business community and former executive of BP.These commissioners will be assisted by an advisory panel of climate scientists whose specific expertise will be called on, obviously, to provide information and advice on the science of climate change. The commission will support open and balanced discussion about climate change and what it means for the Australian economy and our environment.The government is determined to tackle climate change. As a country, we are the highest per capita emitters of carbon pollution, and a carbon price is needed in our economy to cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. The projected growth in our pollution to 2020 is 24 per cent above 2000 levels, which demonstrates the size of the challenge ahead of us. A price tag on pollution is the key to driving transformation in our economy. This will be a key debate this year that will influence the future of our country.On the other side of this House, the Leader of the Opposition has the opportunity to take responsibility and stand up for the national interest of this country. So far, all we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition is 'stop this', 'end this', 'don't do this', 'no' and stunning silences in certain interchanges. The Leader of the Opposition says no to everything - 'stop this', 'no', 'don't do it', 'end this'. The most telling thing about his leadership of the opposition is that at no point has he stood up and taken a principled stand to support what is right and what is necessary in our national interest. This is a key opportunity. He needs to show the leadership that is necessary for this country on such a key challenge.</DOC>

 - The year 2011 is a year of decision and delivery, and it is a year of rebuilding Queensland and the rest of the nation. In order to do that, you need to be able to responsibly fund that rebuilding. That is why I announced a $5.6 billion rebuilding package with a $1.8 billion levy, together with cuts and reprofiling the right package for the nation. In order to legislate the flood levy, the bill needs to pass the House of Representatives and the Senate - of course that is true - and we came into this parliament faced with the blatant political irresponsibility of the Leader of the Opposition. He says on the one hand, 'Rebuild Queensland.' On the other hand, he has no idea how to do it. When he sought to put together a funding package to rebuild Queensland, the best he could do was to snatch a One Nation email out of the system and follow it home. -  - Let there be no doubt about who is writing the economic policy, the foreign affairs policy and the immigration policy of the opposition: One Nation through and through -  -  - in the inbox, printed out by the Leader of the Opposition and stapled to his costings. That was his response. Once again, the package he put forward did not add up. We are used to -  - So once again, when the legislation was brought to the parliament, obviously a big question was: which way was the coalition going to vote? The coalition, rather than voting for fiscal responsibility and rather than voting for the rebuilding of Queensland, instead decided to follow One Nation down a path, which is what their costings were about -  - and to produce costings that did not add up, in just the same way that they produced the $11 billion black hole during the election campaign. Consequently, to secure rebuilding Queensland and to secure this $1.8 billion package to secure the rebuilding that is needed around the nation, the government has of course discussed this legislation with people of goodwill in the parliament. In discussing this with those people of goodwill in the parliament, the government has made adjustments to the package of less than three per cent. Let me say that again: less than three per cent. So we have, crystal clear before this parliament, two sides on this debate - and I include the Independents who care so passionately about rebuilding -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. There are two sides to this debate: people prepared to work together in a spirit of goodwill to rebuild Queensland, prepared to work together in a spirit of goodwill to do the rebuilding that is necessary around the rest of the nation and prepared to work together in a spirit of goodwill to get the financial issues right; and then those who stand for political irresponsibility, who stand in the way of appropriately funding the rebuilding of Queensland and the nation, and who are so bereft of ideas, policy and plans that, when they sit round the shadow cabinet table, what they wait for is someone to run in a One Nation email so they can adopt it as their policy.</DOC>

 - We are clearly going to have one of those days when the volume is dialled up by the opposition because so are the divisions. Just remind me how it goes: the shadow minister hates the shadow Treasurer, they both think the deputy leader is useless and they all hate the member for Wentworth. I think that is how it goes. -  - On the question of health and a healthcare agreement, I thank the member for her question and for asking a question in the national interest. When we came to government the health system was showing the stresses and strains of the Leader of the Opposition having been one of the longest servers in the portfolio of the Minister for Health and Ageing that the nation had ever known. His legacy, when we came to government, was not enough money in the system, not enough doctors, not enough nurses and no reform. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition used to proudly give speeches about how one would not bother with reform. - Having inherited this health system, the government stepped up to what was the underlying problem, which is health costs rising sharply every year - they rise greater than the CPI; they rise greater than the GST. With the federal government year after year under the Leader of the Opposition putting as a percentage less and less into public hospitals and with the rate of increase of the GST not keeping pace, inevitably the financing of state governments was being squeezed and this was not sustainable in the long term. Indeed, had this been allowed to continue without any reform, you would have seen a time when it would have taken all of state government budgets -  - Because of the pressure of the unsustainability of this, reform was sought by the federal government. Indeed, states and territories had been pleading for years with the federal government, with the Leader of the Opposition - but with those pleas falling on deaf ears - for structural reform. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting, which took place following the last sitting week, we have struck a new national agreement which delivers that reform - a new national agreement where the federal government and state and territory governments will step up as equal partners in growth. This is a major structural financing reform which will end forever the spectre that funding public hospitals could become unsustainable for state governments.But with this increase in resources come new requirements for reform. We are going to make sure money goes where it is needed through a single national funding pool, more transparency than ever before, so Australians can see dollars in and dollars out in their healthcare system. We have used our market based tools to ensure that these reforms work effectively - an efficient price to be set so we see no more waste and less bureaucracy with eight bureaucracies heralded in earlier reforms not being proceeded with, empowered local communities through local hospital networks and a transformation in the role of local communities in our healthcare system. We are also stepping up to improve our primary care system, because everybody knows that if you can be kept well and not need to go to hospital that is best for everyone - best for the patient, best for the system. This is a new national reform agreement that will herald a new era of health care: more money, more doctors, more nurses, less waste, less bureaucracy and less waiting time.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question and I can very simply answer it. The government has always been committed to a better and fairer deal for students. We did that because when we came to government after more than a decade of neglect of the needs of country students the participation rate of country students in university was going down. I say to every member of the former government, including the member who asked the question, that they were part and party to the participation rates of regional students going down - a great national shame. The government moved to change that system to make it better and fairer, to end the spectre that some money was going where it was not needed and to bolster participation rates of country students.In generating those reforms we worked with members on the crossbenches and, ultimately - and is it not interesting to remember this now? - we entered into an agreement with the person who asked the question. I shook hands with the shadow minister on an arrangement which then went through the parliament. But he made it immediately obvious to me that, whilst he wanted to secure additional changes to the package, and was prepared to reach an agreement with me on the package, he was not going to defend that package. So instead of having the political responsibility to say to his colleagues, who then complained about it, 'I signed off on it; I stand by it,' he, of course - as we expect from the member for Sturt - actually walked away from these reforms.These reforms have been benefiting students around the country and they have been benefiting students in rural and regional areas. We have seen a 25 per cent increase in dependent youth allowance recipients from rural and regional areas. We have benefited more than 85,000 young people who now receive the maximum rate of youth allowance, a higher rate of youth allowance or a payment of youth allowance for the first time. More than 29,000 are young people from rural and regional areas. More than 25,000 additional students who need to move away from home to study now receive scholarships. This includes more than 10,200 students from regional and rural areas. More than 190,000 additional students now receive scholarships towards their education costs. More than 45,300 are students from regional and rural areas. So I am happy - any day, any time - to compare this government's record for regional and rural students against the government that went before, of which the shadow minister was a member and a minister. I am happy to compare track records any time.Of course, as part of those arrangements we also agreed that there would be a review, and we have agreed to bring that review forward by 12 months. We have worked with people of goodwill who care about students to deal with that. But I can say that we will not give way to the coalition's hypocrisy, we will not give way to the coalition walking away from a deal and we will not give way to their fiscal irresponsibility because once again they are in this parliament with an unfunded bill, and they could not even find a hint as to how to fund it from One Nation this time.We will keep delivering for regional students and improving the system for regional students, and I am very happy to bring forward a review by 12 months to do just that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question, particularly because I understand it is his birthday today. I wish him happy birthday as well.But more importantly than the member for Deakin's birthday is that the electorate of Deakin, along with every other electorate across the country, is going to benefit from our new National Health Reform Plan, which is a truly national agreement. Our plan is going to produce a sustainable, efficient and improved health system.As the Prime Minister has already said, the Commonwealth is stepping up to 50 per cent growth in the system. So in electorates like Deakin, which is fast-growing and where there is a high reliance on our health services, having the Commonwealth sharing the growth, and having that money following where the population is and where the services are needed, is vitally important for reform.Of course, the importance of this reform has been backed up by the response that we have seen from clinicians and health experts, who have been calling for these reforms for well over a decade. As the Prime Minister mentioned, the Leader of the Opposition ignored those claims from stakeholders; but let me just give you a brief taste of some of the responses to our plan, because it has been so widely supported.Andrew Pesce from the AMA:We will have a national health system that is transparent, economically responsible and geared to providing the best possible outcome for patients.Stephen Leeder, an academic leader in this area says the package:_ sets up a structure that should enable basic patient care to be better, especially for people with long-term problems.John Deeble, the architect of Medicare says:I think Julia Gillard's is a pragmatic solution.And even Alan Kohler says that this deal:_ should be used as a template for everything else states do, including education and public transport.Of course, the Liberal Party have absolutely no plan to tackle this problem, but they will have a choice when the legislation comes before the parliament whether or not they will support these important changes.We know the Leader of the Opposition to date has opposed everything we have done in this area. But the time will now come that he has to make a choice whether to support this or not. In fact, we know he opposed this deal before the meeting was even finished. He was out there giving a press conference on Sunday afternoon, saying it was a bad deal before he had even seen what was in the agreement. That is absolutely a measure -  - Perhaps those who are interjecting opposite have not had a chance yet to see the Essential Media Communications research report that was actually just given to me after we came into question time and which says that 67 per cent of the population approve of our health deal. Interestingly for those who are arguing opposite - particularly the member for Dickson, who is always more focused on internal Liberal Party matters than others - 62 per cent of Liberal voters support this package, just not the Leader of the Opposition or the health spokesperson.The time will come very shortly when the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party will have to make a decision whether they are going to simply continue to oppose every health reform that will deliver for patients or whether they will act in the national interest to back this plan which clinicians and experts across the country, and every state and territory leader - including two Liberal premiers - think is a good deal. The time has come for the Leader of the Opposition to support this health reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In terms of climate change, there is no question that the government has to act to set a price on carbon. That has been very clear. What is more perplexing to me is the inability of the opposition to form a position on climate change. What we need in order to assert and put downward pressure on rising energy prices is to provide certainty with a price for carbon. That is why we have the position which we do. When we talk about certainty and we talk about climate change, I think it also reasonable to say that this government is very committed to certainty, unlike the opposition. We cannot even get certainty on who is running the opposition. Of course, I am referring to Samantha Maiden's very interesting article, which I am holding up, with its characterisations of the various wannabe leaders of the opposition. -  - We have the poodle. No prizes for guessing who that is. We have the million-dollar man -  - All right, and I will not even go to who the rat is in the opposition. - You'd need a big bit of cheese in front of some of these frontbenchers. -  -  - Stroke those whiskers! In terms of the issue of climate change, the only way to exert downward pressure on rising power prices is to set a price on carbon. The problem is -  -  - No, no, what we need is investor certainty. The real problem with fighting climate change is that the opposition are too busy fighting each other to do anything on climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question and, in particular, for the work that the parliamentary committee, led by the member for New England, is doing with members of both sides of the parliament in working with communities to make sure we have a constructive approach to building strong communities at the same time as we are working towards preserving and improving the health of the Murray-Darling Basin river system itself.There were three recommendations that the committee put in an interim report to me a couple of weeks ago. Those three recommendations went, firstly, to wanting to see whether or not the buyback system is capable of being conducted in a more strategic fashion; secondly, wanting to look at some taxation arrangements which have been holding back some of the programs that we have; and, thirdly, wanting to look at how environmental works and measures might be able to lead to a more efficient use of the environmental assets within the basin.I am pleased to report that in Dubbo on Friday, on behalf of the government, I was able to give the beginnings of our response to each of those three issues, and I want to thank all members of that committee for their work in highlighting those issues in the way they have. In a similar way, some of these issues have been highlighted to the government through the irrigation roundtable attended by the agriculture minister, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, and me.To take each of those three issues in turn, there is some connection between the first two. The taxation arrangements have themselves prevented some of the strategic buyback programs from going ahead. It is important if you want to be able to purchase strategically from the outer channels that you have a local irrigation authority lead it. If it is simply done by the Commonwealth, you run the risk of a situation where you pay a premium on the outer channels. Having purchased that water, they are then free to trade back in on the water market at a lower price and essentially all you end up doing is getting bad value for money for the Commonwealth. If it is led by the irrigation authority then they can close the channel once the buyback has taken place, thus not just making that allocation available to go back to the environment but also freeing up some of the conveyance water that was there as well.Those taxation issues are now resolved by a letter that was signed off by the Prime Minister on Friday morning, and there will be legislation which will be introduced to the parliament fixing those problems with taxation that go to the difference between when the liability was created and when the deduction was then claimed back over three years. That legislation, when it is introduced, will backdate to April 2010. There is still more work that we are doing in bringing about a more strategic approach to buybacks, but that is at least an early dividend on those programs. It has allowed round 2 of the private irrigation operators program to now be launched in New South Wales, putting a further $373 million on the table in this strategic area.Finally, on environmental works and measures, I have contacted all my state colleagues within the Murray-Darling Basin, and there is an intention now for all basin water ministers to meet in April outside of the ministerial council process. That meeting will be for ministers themselves to put the items on the agenda that they want, but I have put as the first listing of items on the agenda from the Commonwealth a request for them to bring forward proposals for more effective use of environmental works and measures. There is a lot of good work that irrigators have done to be more efficient, and I do believe it is a fair call for us to see if we can manage some our environmental assets more efficiently as well.I want to thank all members of the House for their participation on the Windsor inquiry. It is a very big part of making sure that around this time next year we can deliver certainty for communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question. As this House knows, this government and this Prime Minister are strongly committed to health reform and to building a modern healthcare system that extends the extraordinary achievements that our country made last century to building Australian health outcomes well into the 21st century. Central to that task is building a robust and integrated primary healthcare network. As members well know, primary care in Australia is largely delivered through a market based fee-for-service system funded through Medicare; and, while this system works very well for most Australians, it leaves gaps for many others. These gaps particularly affect older Australians and Australians experiencing mental illness. That is why the government accepted the central recommendation of the Bennett commission - to establish a network of primary healthcare organisations - and that is why an accelerated rollout of Medicare locals and a GP after-hours service were central to the recent COAG agreement achieved by the Prime Minister a couple of weeks ago.Medicare locals will transform the coordination and the delivery of good-quality primary care in local communities. They will ensure that patients are assigned a GP after discharge from hospitals to reduce the chance of readmission - a chance that is particularly high for older Australians and Australians with mental illness. They will play a critical role in facilitating arrangements between aged-care facilities, GPs and allied health professionals to increase the number of services being delivered at aged-care facilities, because we know that when those arrangements are in place residents simply receive more services. They will manage the GP after-hours service, which was fast-tracked by the Prime Minister at the recent COAG agreement. While this is obviously great news for all Australians, including older Australians living at home, it is simply a godsend for registered nurses working night shift at residential aged-care facilities, whose only resort when a resident falls ill is often to call an ambulance. These connections between aged care and primary care are critical to reducing the number of traumatic, avoidable hospital admissions from aged-care facilities, which currently occur about once every 20 minutes or so.The most common feedback that I have received from Australians experiencing mental illness, particularly severe mental illness, is the lack of good integration between the different clinical and non-clinical support services that they receive. Medicare locals will be able to deliver, for the first time under a Commonwealth health program, integrated packages of care that deliver clinical and non-clinical support services wrapped around their individual needs - a reform that will be more responsive to individual needs and a reform that undoubtedly will deliver better outcomes. More broadly, Medicare locals will quickly become innovators in this important area of quality primary care lifting our research effort in this important field and driving the continuous improvement in health care for Australians.This is a welcome and overdue reform. It will deliver better outcomes in health for all Australians but, importantly, it will help ensure that older Australians and Australians living with mental illness get access to the same level of good-quality primary health care that the rest of us take for granted.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the Assistant Treasurer, sorry the minister, sorry the shadow minister for, sorry, the shadow Treasurer -  - Sorry. As the opposition leader knows sometimes you have those momentary blackouts don't you? - The question goes towards saying that the Treasurer on 9 -  -  - The shadow Treasurer has asked a question quoting the Treasurer on 9 February talking about the need for a levy. Then alluding to 18 February the shadow Treasurer quoted selectively from the Treasurer again. This government will make sure that it does what it has to do to fund the reconstruction which is necessary due to this flood damage.This government is the only major party in here with a plan to help Queensland and other areas of Australia which were disastrously affected by the floods. What we propose is that two-thirds of the reconstruction be funded from the reallocation and reprioritisation of existing government programs and from changes to the programs. We are proposing that one-third of the reconstruction bill comes from the levy. That is what we have said we are going to do and that is what we are going to do. However -  - the opposition seem to be making some play of the negotiations with the crossbenchers which will see $150 million change from the initial proposition which will then be found by budget time by analysing where further cuts can be made to compensate for the arrangements that have been struck in the negotiations over this flood levy.But let us be clear. There is an assumption in the question somehow that, if given their druthers, the opposition have a better plan. They do not have a better plan. In their propositions for costings I think the shadow Treasurer made a mistake that the shadow finance minister might not have made in that he double counted some of the money which was promised for their cuts. I can understand the well-reported frustration of the capable shadow finance minister that he is not writing the questions which the shadow treasurer is asking. Let us be clear, there is no contradiction in what the Treasurer has said. We will fund this reconstruction. All I would say to the opposition is that if they will not lead and they will not follow then just get out of the way and let Australia get on with flood recovery.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her very important question, raising as it does an important issue that confronts this House and this nation as it sits this week. We have proudly created a multicultural society with record levels of postwar migration. Indeed, I stand here as one example of that migration. Overwhelmingly, across those years, that multiculturalism, that unity, that non-discriminatory immigration policy has had bipartisan support. I am prepared to pay tribute to Prime Minister Menzies who supported postwar migration. I am prepared to pay tribute to Prime Minister Menzies for creating the Colombo Plan. I am prepared to pay tribute to Prime Minister Holt for ending the White Australia policy and to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser for admitting Vietnamese boat people to this country and for creating SBS as one expression of our diversity and unity - bipartisanship all of the way.For those of us who represent growth communities in this country - and I do - know that in those growth communities there is often pressure on people when they see inwards migration. People easily fear change; people easily fear difference. When they see increased pressure on public services sometimes that fear can turn to resentment. It is the job of national leadership to reassure in the face of that fear and to explain to people that there is ultimately nothing to be afraid of. Just as we have incorporated migrants in this country in the past we will incorporate migrants in this country in the future. As well as reassuring it is the job of national leadership to make sure that we plan services and communities properly so that fear does not turn to resentment.There is another path and that is seeking to channel that fear and that resentment into political gain. We have seen that other path used in national politics. We saw it used by One Nation. I am so glad that this nation defeated that spectre of One Nation by coming together as political parties across the divide of this aisle and putting One Nation last on how-to-vote cards. I am really proud our nation did that. But I would have to say that spectre of those ugly politics, that grubby path, is before us again. The principal task of this parliament this week is to banish that spectre again. - It will require the Leader of the Opposition to do some difficult things. It will require the Leader of the Opposition to replace his shadow minister for immigration. - It will require the Leader of the Opposition to replace his shadow parliamentary secretary but, in the interests of banishing that ugly spectre from national politics, that is what the Leader of the Opposition must do this week. - We have a clear path forward which we should be on together - bipartisanship about multiculturalism, bipartisanship about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship and bipartisanship about a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Let's hope that is how we end the week. I fear that is not how it started.</DOC>

 - We know that maths was never the Leader of the Opposition's strong point, so let me explain to him the reforms that I have entered into and why I have entered into them. They provide to the states and territories the same amount of growth money as would have been provided under earlier reforms. That means that we will be an equal partner in growth: fifty-fifty for the future. Of course, it will be in the interests of the Commonwealth to properly fund primary care to keep people out of acute hospital beds because we are equal partners in growth.I can understand the Leader of the Opposition's naivety about all of this - because he never did it as health minister over five long years - but to strike a national health agreement with profound reform consequences requires you to get agreement from the states and territories. It was clear that we did not have agreement from Western Australia, and, following the election in Victoria, it became clear we were unlikely to hold agreement from Victoria. So in those circumstances I made a decision about how we could deliver national health reform and growth money with the key reform elements in place and get a national agreement.I knew it was not going to be easy, but at the Council of Australian Governments meeting I did it. I did it in the nation's interest and in the interests of every Australian. Profoundly I did not want someone in Perth or someone in Broome to have different healthcare arrangements to someone in Brisbane or someone in Cairns. I did not want people in Brunswick to have different healthcare arrangements to people in Burnside in South Australia. I wanted people around the nation to benefit from more money in hospitals, from more doctors, from more nurses, from more transparency, from more local control and from more efficient pricing. I wanted them to benefit from that, and I wanted them to no longer have to tolerate the waste, the waiting times and the bureaucracy that have been characteristics of the system today. In those circumstances, I moved to the agreement that I struck at the Council of Australian Governments meeting.Let us just for one moment consider the alternative. Presumably the Leader of the Opposition remains committed to the things that he did as health minister: a declining percentage of hospital funds, GP cutbacks so that there were always GP shortages, never training enough nurses and $1 billion out of public hospitals - these are the things that the Leader of the Opposition stood for as health minister. If the Leader of the Opposition no longer stands for those things, wouldn't you think that, having been opposition leader for this amount of time, he would have a comprehensive healthcare plan? After all, of all the areas of public policy that he should have a grip on, health should be the one where he has the best grip - five years as minister. But what do we see from this Leader of the Opposition? Negativity, carping and no plans. We will get on with making a difference for people around the country, and you get on with your whingeing because you are incapable of anything else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question. Last week I announced the government's new multiculturalism strategy. Our response to the report of the Australian Multicultural Advisory Council The people of Australia is an opportunity for the government and for the House to say clearly and openly Australian multiculturalism has worked and to embrace that principle renewed. Australia invites new members of our community to fully participate in our society. The celebration of new cultures takes place in an environment of freedom and respect and traditional Australian values and, whenever there is a conflict between those values, of course those traditional Australian values must always win out. Not only has the Australian economy benefited from the immigration of those from diverse backgrounds of great skills but our society has also benefited from the cultures they have brought with them and sustained in this their new  homeland. People come here not to change our values but because of them - because Australia is a place of freedom and tolerance and because Australia is a place of freedom and democracy. They come not to change that but because of that.We on this side of the House are proud of what multiculturalism has meant and continues to mean to Australian life. In launching this new strategy last week, I noted that multiculturalism was not the exclusive child of the Labor Party or the Liberal Party. I pay particular tribute to former Prime Minister Fraser, who first made multiculturalism explicitly the national policy, and the Prime Minister also paid tribute to her predecessor a few minutes ago. It is the responsibility of elected officials to ensure that the debate on immigration and multiculturalism is handled sensitively, maturely and - most importantly - honestly. It is incumbent on all political leaders to uphold the values of freedom of religion and respect, and any pandering to or encouragement of any prejudice in the community has no place in the Australian political discourse.Let me say this very clearly: this government condemns in the strongest possible terms the statements like those of the parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition last Friday. Senator Bernardi said: 'Islam itself is the problem.' As I said earlier, multiculturalism is based on the traditional Australian values of democracy and freedom, including freedom of religious expression. Any attack on any religion's traditions is an attack on the freedom of religion of every single Australian. It is important not only that this side of the House condemns those remarks but that all members of this House condemn those remarks and that the Leader of the Opposition not only distances himself from those remarks but also explicitly condemns the remarks of his own parliamentary secretary.Multiculturalism and harmony depend on the promotion of mutual understanding, not the perpetuation of intolerance. Comments like those from Senator Bernardi do a great disservice to the traditions of his party. More importantly, they do a great disservice to this nation.</DOC>

 - I am just trying to recall the seat that the member represents - McPherson. Congratulations for winning the preselection for McPherson, too. In terms of Commonwealth arrangements on hospital funding, the government remain committed, as we have since being elected, to reforming hospital funding in Australia. What we have done since the election, what has been negotiated most recently at COAG, is that 50 per cent of funding of the COAG arrangements will be done by the federal government. From 2014 to 2020, there will be $16 billion extra spent by the Commonwealth in this COAG arrangement. When we have a look at what has been done in terms of health reform and the efforts of the opposition -  - I always love it when the Leader of the Opposition gets his spiritual mother up to help him out! I did not ask the member to run her point of order, but I listened very carefully. In terms of infrastructure expenditure, just to assist the member for McPherson, our Health and Hospitals Fund is $1.8 billion, for which bids are currently open. We will be allocating up to $5 billion going forward. The member for McPherson is always welcome to go to the government website to find the answers to these questions, as well as question time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. As members of the House would know, not only does he represent a flood affected region but, indeed, his own electorate office was flooded. I did want to draw the attention of the House to a number of announcements that have been made about further assistance for those affected by natural disasters since the House last sat. When the House last sat, of course, we did in part talk through arrangements that had been made for natural disaster assistance. They included: the Australian government disaster relief payment; emergency money; the income subsidy arrangement, which helps people who, either as working people or as small business owners or primary producers, are unable to go about their normal income-earning activity because of natural disaster; concessional loans; clean-up money and the like to support people, whether they be in small businesses or households; and some relief for householders who need to purchase new household effects and deal with the consequences of natural disasters in their home.Since the parliament has last sat, the government has made two important announcements. I do direct people's attention, particularly those from Queensland, to the announcement that we made to support community groups in Queensland. I know that in the member for Oxley's area - just one subset, but it was true right across Queensland - community groups have come to the fore, and many community groups themselves have been impacted by the natural disaster. So, under category C of the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, we are providing recovery grants of up to $25,000 for not-for-profit organisations in 36 local areas affected by recent disasters. Of course, under our standing arrangements for natural disasters, that is funded 75 per cent by the Commonwealth and 25 per cent by the state.I also had the opportunity in the week the parliament did not sit to tour cyclone affected areas. I did that with the member for Kennedy. It was in his electorate, and I thank him for accompanying me during that visit. The member for Kennedy arranged for me to see some people who had been quite devastated by the cyclone in Tully Heads. Their homes have been very, very badly hit by the cyclone and will need a lot of assistance to get back. It also enabled me to meet with local banana growers, representatives of the Cardwell community, the Mission Beach community and Dunk Island community and to talk broadly with the local council about local needs.I want to draw people's attention to the fact that we have announced a specific cyclone recovery package. It is modelled on what was done in Cyclone Larry, but it is actually an improvement in significant areas. It provides for concessional loans of up to $650,000 - that is a higher level. It provides for a grant component of up to $50,000. It provides for wage assistance to help businesses remain viable and to hold their workforces. It provides a $20 million rural resilience fund to enable communities to recover and come through. So I direct the attention of members in affected areas to these announcements. They will no doubt be called on to provide information to their local constituents. I believe it is very important to bring that to the House's attention so that the right information can get to local community members.</DOC>

 - What I can say to the member and what I can absolutely confirm is that the track record of the Howard government when it came to a percentage of public hospital funding was all one way: down, down, down. Under this government and under our health reform proposals, it is all one way: up, up, up. It is an increased percentage from the federal government, because we care about public hospitals. Gone are the days of the Leader of the Opposition ripping a billion dollars out.What we are doing to the end of this decade is investing more than $16 billion extra in growth funds. That comes on top of having increased the Australian healthcare agreements by 50 per cent. It comes on top of making resources available for elective surgery to get through waiting lists - and that has financed, I believe, around 70,000 procedures. It comes on top of the amount of money that we have made available to upgrade emergency departments. It comes on top of the investments we have made in primary care, like GP superclinics. It comes on top of reversing our shortage of doctors by getting doctors into training. We were short of doctors, courtesy of the Leader of the Opposition, and we have moved to address that. We will train 6,000 doctors by the end of this decade. It comes on top of our investment in increased nursing places; we are training around 1,000 new nurses each year. I am very proud of those investments, which are making a difference.We are making sure that money is not given without reform. There are no blank cheques. States will need to reform their systems - one transparent national pool, so you will know where the money goes. That is something the Leader of the Opposition could never have achieved, and indeed did not have the wit to dream of. Local hospital networks are another thing the Leader of the Opposition did not achieve and did not have the wit to dream of. This comes on top of making sure that around the country we know where efficient prices are being obtained - where there is no waste. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition does not have the reform drive to bring our market based tools to bear on a system like the healthcare system.So I say to the shadow minister who asked the question that perhaps, rather than coming into question time asking questions like this, he would be better off seeing if he can think of a healthcare plan, because at some point people are going to turn to the shadow minister and say, 'Well, if you are carping about the government's plan - with its $16 billion, with its 50 per cent funding, with its transparency, with its efficient price, with its new standards, with its less waiting time, with its less waste, with its less red tape, with its more money, with its more doctors, with its more nurses and with its more investment in primary care - what is your plan?' We will be awaiting the answer from the shadow minister for health, because we have not heard one yet.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Last time the parliament sat we heard a lot of stories about the incredible work that our pilots did in terrible conditions. This question gives me an opportunity to thank the men and women who put those pilots in the air and helped to keep them there.Last year I spoke to an old pilot who told me that unless the ground crew can get you to the start line a pilot is not worth two bob. Over the last few weeks of this terrible summer, there have been a lot of men and women doing a lot of work to get our planes and helicopters to the start line. One of them is a man named Col Beal. Col heads up the Black Hawk maintenance team at Oakey. Our Black Hawks have already flown more than 700 hours this year. For every hour in the sky, there are a lot more hours of repair and maintenance on the ground, and that has meant that Col's team has done a lot of work early in the morning and late at night. Some of his team came back from Christmas holidays, others had their own homes flooded. Col had his head under a Black Hawk the day that his car was washed down the street in Toowoomba when the inland tsunami hit that town. It is because of people like Col and his team that we were able to deliver so many supplies to isolated communities and winch so many people to safety.One of those people was an old lady who lives near the town of Forest Hill in the Lockyer Valley. On 11 January this lady got the shock of her life when she found a sergeant in a full flight suit and a helmet standing in her lounge room. It was 7.30 at night. He had been winched into her backyard into water waste deep. He waded around to the front steps and into her house and told her that it was time to go. She said, 'Don't worry, my daughter is coming around to pick me up.' Unfortunately, that was not going to happen, because her house had been isolated and all the roads had been cut off.The lady then went and got her purse and had a look for some change. She told the pilot: 'Sorry love, I don't have enough money for a helicopter.' He told her: 'Don't worry, this one's a freebie.' She then went into the kitchen to put the kettle on and said, 'Would you like a cup of tea?' He said that he would love one but that they did not have time. He had been in the house for about 20 minutes. It was pitch black and the helicopter was still hovering overhead with three other people who had been rescued that afternoon and it was running low on fuel. He finally got her to the front door and onto her steps where he put a harness around her and, with live electrical cables only two metres away, was able to winch her to the safety of the Black Hawk.This was only able to happen because of a patient and brave sergeant, because of the men and women hovering overhead in the Black Hawk and because of the men and women back at Oakey who had been working through the night to get that Black Hawk to the start line. It is a nice story. It is a nice story from a terrible day in a terrible month. It is also a timely reminder for all of us here that saving lives, just like rebuilding Queensland, requires us all to work together.</DOC>

 - Now I have heard everything: a representative of the political party responsible for the 'Unchain my heart' campaign and the Work Choices campaign - in its hundreds of millions of dollars, together with the mouse pads that I presume we still have not managed to get rid of - coming into this place and raising a question about government advertising. But I will at least give the member who asked the question credit where it is due. I think he is one of the Work Choices supporters on the back bench still out loud and proud. That advertising worked for him. When he watched those ads and got the mouse pad, the pen, the coffee cup and all the rest of it, it certainly worked for him.The government, of course, has advertised in the past and - here is the news - there will be things that we advertise in the future. It is appropriate to get public information to people about changes in government services, including reforms. - What the member may want to acknowledge is that the reform agreement entered into at the Council of Australian Governments meeting is a reform agreement that has the support of the Premier of Western Australia and the Premier of Victoria. This may cause the member to think to himself: 'When people who were there who run states and health services are prepared to sign up to this reform, what should I conclude from this?' What he should conclude is that it is not appropriate to come into this House and carp and whinge, particularly in circumstances where you have got no policies and no plans for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The international community, including people in this country, remain engaged with recent developments in the Middle East because, ultimately, they impact on us all. If the democratic transformation process in the Middle East goes wrong in countries like Egypt, there are profound implications in terms of terrorism, the power of Iran in the region, what happens to global energy prices and what happens with the future of international people movements.What we have seen across the Middle East in recent times is a universal cry for freedom. We have seen this right across the region. We have seen a call for freedom of expression, a call for the right to peaceful protest, a call for the right of freedom of political association and, above all, a call for the ability to have free and fair elections. These are rights enjoyed here, but Freedom House tells us that across the world half of the human family at present do not have these freedoms.Of course, in a time of political change and political transformation, there are many uncertainties that lie ahead. For example, what will happen in Egypt? What will now happen in Tunisia? What will happen in other parts of the region? What many are concerned about is whether non-democratic forces using the new-found democratic freedoms of the region will exploit those opportunities and, if given the chance, then wind back the clock on democracy, as we have seen most atrociously in Iran.That is why the international community has a responsibility now to stand by the people of Egypt and support them at a difficult time of political transformation. That is why we have senior officials from Australia and a number of other countries meeting in Brussels on Wednesday of this week. That is why we are in contact with foreign ministers around the world at present. That is why we are also in direct contact with the interim Egyptian government about the needs they have now to stabilise food prices, in order to maximise economic and social stability at a time of radical political change.Beyond all of this, I could simply say to honourable members that we have also been seized by recent developments in Libya. Today I have instructed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to call in the Libyan ambassador to register our condemnation, together with that of other states around the world, of the flagrant use of lethal force against innocent civilians in Benghazi. The threat of the continued use of lethal force has been reiterated only this morning by the son of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif Gaddafi. We have upgraded the travel advisory for Libya. We have something short of 100 Australians registered as resident in Libya, and our consulate-general in Tripoli remains in contact with Australian residents there.Early this morning I also spoke to the foreign affairs minister of Bahrain. Honourable members will know that in Bahrain we have also seen a loss of life, but the Bahraini authorities have decided in the last three days to withdraw their military from the streets and to also instruct their police to use non-lethal means to deal with peaceful protests. We will continue to monitor this closely.This is a time of great uncertainty across the region, with protests in Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan, Syria, Iran and Iraq. The time is now for political transformation and support for these countries around the world.</DOC>

 - It was a great honour and privilege to be with the Governor-General and the Leader of the Opposition at the War Memorial yesterday evening to open the Hall of Valour. I said the words that the Leader of the Opposition has repeated during that occasion and I also echoed the words of wartime Prime Minister John Curtin that the War Memorial is the 'sanctuary of Australia's traditions'.I can advise the House that the government provided the Australian War Memorial with more than $38 million this financial year, which is comparable to previous financial years. I can also say to the Leader of the Opposition and the House: I have been concerned about resourcing for the War Memorial and that is why I directed the review of its financial position, which has been undertaken by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, working with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. That review, undertaken by my direction, is well advanced and I will be receiving it soon. Having received that review, when I am in a position to I will make further statements about resourcing for the War Memorial.But I would point to the fact that there are a number of claims that have been made publicly which simply are not right. The Leader of the Opposition's question was premised on a false claim. Let me convey the facts to the House, if people are interested in the facts. The facts are: the government will provide the Australian War Memorial with more than $38 million -  - I presume every member of the House is interested in the facts: the government will provide the Australian War Memorial with more than $38 million this financial year.There have been claims made that 20 per cent of the memorial staff are seeking other employment. That is wrong. The current ongoing staff turnover rate is 3.02 per cent, and that is tracking below the previous five-year average of 3.73 per cent. Claims have been made that the memorial staff are taking a pay cut. These claims are wrong. Staff have received yearly pay increases under enterprise agreements and other wage increase mechanisms and most recently received a three per cent pay increase on 1 July 2010. This flows from their enterprise agreement. There have been claims made that staff are being paid from the wrong budget. These claims are wrong. Memorial council policy, endorsed by the ANAO, the auditor, is only to fund staff costs from capital funds when costs are associated with enhancing or replacing an asset or extending its life, so funds are being taken from the right source.I understand that members of the House of Representatives and Australians generally would be concerned to see appropriate resourcing for the War Memorial, as am I. They would be keen to make sure any claims made publicly are accurate. I have provided the accurate information to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, a question of real concern to Australians. I am sure that this whole chamber would join me in condemning clearly and unequivocally the violence that we have seen in Libya. What we have seen is a state take up the weapons of war against its own people. The results - and we have seen them for ourselves on our TV screens - have been bloody and they have been shocking. The international community has spoken with one voice, having seen what has happened in Libya, and that one voice has said that there must be no more violence. We absolutely condemn the threat by Colonel Gaddafi's son to plunge Libya into a state of civil war and we call on the Libyan authorities to listen to their people.There have been weeks of uncertainty and turmoil in the Arab world and during those weeks of uncertainty and turmoil, as they continue, the government's top priority has been the safety of Australians. I can advise the House, as I have stated publicly and as is now available through all of the usual channels, that our travel advisory for Libya says simply and succinctly: do not travel to Libya. We are concerned about the circumstances of Australians in Libya. I can advise the House that we have some 105 Australians registered as in Libya at the present time. We are advising them to leave the country if it is safe for them to do so. Of course, in giving this advice we recognise that they would be worried about their safety, we recognise that their families would be worried about their safety and we recognise that organising travel would not be easy.Consequently, our embassy in Cairo, which is accredited to Libya, and our consul general in Tripoli are making contingency plans for emergency evacuation options. An emergency task force meeting was held this morning to coordinate our response. I would like to take this opportunity in the parliament to thank the government of the United Kingdom, which has made an offer to us to help with emergency evacuations should that be necessary.Across all these days of difficulty in various countries, and now particularly in Libya, we have been very clear about the position of the Australian government and what we believe in. We support the rights of citizens to peacefully protest and we do not believe that those peaceful protests should be met by violence. We also understand the aspirations of people for freedom, for democracy, for the kinds of things that we take for granted. These are aspirations that cannot be suppressed. They cannot be denied. They keep coming through. We have seen that on the streets of Libya as we saw it on the streets of Egypt. I want to ensure in these circumstances not only that the voice of Australia is heard but also that we do everything we can to keep Australians in Libya safe, and that is what we are doing at the moment.</DOC>

 - I absolutely welcome that question from the shadow Treasurer about the need in this country to have a more competitive banking system. It is obvious that the opposition does not think we should have a more competitive banking system. The shadow Treasurer can wave any paper he likes - whether it is a national newspaper or an FOI - but the behaviour of the banks tells us that exit fees are a huge barrier to competition. That is why we need the package of reforms that were outlined by the government at the end of last year.Everybody on this side of the House understands how important it is to have a much more competitive banking system, how important it is to empower consumers, how important it is to boost the smaller lenders and how important it is to ensure that there is a flow of funds to the banking system through initiatives like covered bonds. But, of course, the shadow Treasurer is the only one in this House that thinks unfair exit fees are fair and that they should stay. He thinks exit fees of $7,000 are fair. That is his position. He thinks they are fair. We are committed to their abolition. As a consequence of that commitment at the end of last year, we have seen banks move to either abolish their exit fees or to bring more competition into the system.When at the end of last year some of those banks put up their rates over and above the Reserve Bank decision, they were effectively saying, 'We're not afraid of the consumer; they won't move because we've got them locked in with really big and unfair exit fees.' That is the position that is supported by the opposition. They are not for customers; they are for the big banks. That is where the shadow Treasurer is.There are only two things that are stopping consumers walking down the road and getting a better deal when it comes to their mortgages - unfair exit fees and the shadow Treasurer. We are going to get rid of the first. We are going to get rid of unfair exit fees and, of course, Mr Robb might give us a hand to do the second. What a rabble we have got over there. How can they actually ask these questions with a straight face? The finance spokesman wants the job of the shadow Treasurer, the shadow Treasurer wants the job of the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition wants to be leader of One Nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As members of the parliament know, the member for Blair's electorate and the communities that he represents were very badly hit by the floodwaters in Queensland. Having visited there myself, I know that it will be a long way back but one that the member will be very much involved in, just as he was very involved in dealing with the emergency situation when floodwaters hit.After such a range of natural disasters hitting our nation over summer, it falls to us to make the decisions in the national interest to rebuild Queensland and rebuild affected communities around the nation. This requires us to make available the money to get the job done. That is why the government have outlined our $5.6 billion package to rebuild communities in Queensland and around the nation. It is the right package.In addition to that package, we are making available assistance to those communities that have been hit by the devastating cyclone that hit Queensland. I visited some of those cyclone affected communities with the member for Kennedy. We have brought the right package to the parliament. It is the right package because it means we pay as we go. We are not exercising the soft option of simply borrowing and not meeting this obligation. With a strong economy we can afford to pay as we go.It is the right package too because we have cut back in areas of the government budget. So, for every $3 spent through this package on recovery and reconstruction, $2 will come from government savings. It is a package that has been calibrated to make the right economic judgments. It is also a package that includes a temporary levy which is fair in its construction. This nation has used levies in the past to meet exceptional needs. This levy is the right levy to meet these exceptional needs.I understand that families always find it tough to make ends meet. But let us remind ourselves that 60 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay less than $1 a week under this levy. Almost 40 per cent of the funds will come from those earning over $300,000 a year, and that is appropriate. In contrast, people who earn less than $50,000 a year will not be asked to make any contribution at all through the levy. This is the right package, the right way of financing in a strong economy where we can pay as we go.This week the House of Representatives will make its decision on this flood levy. I use this opportunity to say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to put the politics aside and to act in the national interest. It is time to put the politics aside and to support the levy so that we have in place the funding we need in order to rebuild Queensland and rebuild around the nation. The Leader of the Opposition would now honestly have to say to Australians: his alternative funding package is in a shambles and does not even enjoy the support of his own frontbench. In these circumstances, it is time to put the politics aside and to support the government's legislation. We have a plan to rebuild the nation and to rebuild Queensland. We want to get on with the job, we want to get on with the plan, and consequently the Leader of the Opposition should support the government in those endeavours.</DOC>

 - I reject the assertions of the shadow minister for finance. It makes sense that getting rid of unfair exit fees makes our banking system more competitive. I understand that some of the very profitable banks do not like the idea of getting rid of unfair mortgage exit fees, and I understand that one or two other banks that are not big banks are not supporting it either. But the government's view is very clear and very principled: they are not fair and, therefore, they should be abolished. They should be abolished in the interest of greater competition.It is asserted by some that their abolition may mean that customers will pay more in other fees, but we have dealt with this in our consumer law and we have already put in place very clear provisions that unconscionable conduct when it comes to fees from banks will be scrutinised very closely by the regulator. It will not be tolerated if a bank seeks to move the fee from an unfair exit fee to somewhere else in the system, and that will be scrutinised very closely.Let us be clear what this is all about. This is all about the fact that those opposite do not have a positive view for Australia's future. They say no to everything. They say no to health reform. They say no to a flood levy. They could never support stimulus to save this economy from recession. And now, yet again, they are playing opportunistic politics - but they are absolutely on the wrong side. Everybody over there now is putting up their hand and saying they think it is a good thing that there can be unfair exit fees as high as $7,000 locking customers into their loans and their banks when they are unhappy. The government will not tolerate that. That is why we are bringing this legislation forward. Every member of this House will have a very clear say on this legislation, and we will see where they stand. Do they stand for customers or do they stand for the banks?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for raising the issue, which is of concern not only to people in Victoria but also to anyone who values our national park system across Australia. There are three different points of relevance to my portfolio. The first two are statutory obligations under the EPBC Act. The Victorian government did not notify my department prior to the introduction of cattle to the Alpine National Park. We are seeking information from the Victorian department as to the reasons they decided not to make that notification. Whether they should have or not is something I cannot judge until I receive the departmental advice. If it is found that they should have referred it, that in and of itself does not mean that they have broken federal environmental law in having the cattle there. There will then be a stage of further advice where I will have to consider whether or not federal environmental law has been broken. On each of those two issues I have to deal with the contents of the act and the contents of the act alone, and I cannot judge any of that until I receive my departmental advice.A separate aspect, though, is the role that I have as federal environment minister, simply as an advocate for the environment in Australia, in deciding whether or not federal law has been breached. I say in the strongest possible terms to the Victorian government that, whether they have breached federal law or not, we are talking about a national park, not a farm. We are talking about a national park that is there for the preservation of native species. -  - It may come as a shock to some of the National Party members interjecting across there that cattle are not native Australian animals. I know that is a shock for the National Party. When I had the agriculture portfolio, I would happily defend the rights of farmers when they were culling kangaroos on their properties because a farm is not a home for a kangaroo, and it was quite appropriate for farmers to be culling the kangaroos on their properties. But, in the same way, a national park is not a place to find a home for cattle. - The Victorian government should see sense on this. It is a very simple, straightforward issue as to whether our national park estate is going to be preserved for the environment. I accept that on the other side of the chamber there are very different views on the treatment of the environment to those that we have on this side of the chamber. But at the very least they should accept that national parks, if nothing else, are special. - If they do not even want to say that national parks are really special, they should at least be seen as being special enough that they are not appropriate sites for grazing. One of the interjections that came across earlier referred to the heritage concepts of grazing in the Alpine National Park. Make no mistake: we are not talking about a situation where you had drovers on horseback taking the cattle up the slopes. The cattle were dropped off in a truck - the cattle were sent there and unloaded from the back of a truck. What is going on there is a treatment of a national park which every Australian other than a handful of people on that side of the chamber knows is the wrong way to treat a national park. If we can learn nothing else from this episode, whether or not we end up in a situation of the Victorian government having breached federal environmental law, every Australian knows at least this: when you get a change of government away from Labor in this country you get a worse environmental outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for that very important question, because the impact of both the floods and Cyclone Yasi in Queensland - as well as elsewhere in Australia, flowing through to Victoria - has been absolutely immense. What we are dealing with here in economic terms is the largest natural disaster in Australia's history. Of course, we are learning more about its impact, particularly in Far North Queensland and North Queensland, all of the time. I have had the opportunity to go there in recent weeks, and it has been quite dramatic. So we have a very big repair and rebuilding job on our hands. As a nation what we have to do is approach that in a mature way; we have to approach it in a responsible way. The government announced our $5.6 billion package, two-thirds funded by savings and one-third by a modest levy, to do precisely that. And that was before we saw the impact of Cyclone Yasi. So we have a very big rebuild on our hands.In those circumstances, a modest, temporary levy is the reasonable thing to do. A modest, temporary levy for someone on $68,000 a year is $1.74 per week - $1.74. It is not a large amount of money for people to chip in so we can get together a larger amount of money to rebuild our nation - Queensland in particular but also elsewhere in the country. It is also important that we do it in this way because we have a big economic challenge on our hands, particularly to prepare for the impacts of mining boom mark 2. That is very important as well.In the middle of all of this, have we seen a responsible approach from the opposition? Of course we have not. Just like they said no to all of the initiatives that were required during the global recession, they have said no. Just as they said no to tackling climate change, they are saying no to rebuilding Queensland. In a national crisis, no is not an answer - but that is all we get from those opposite. It is extraordinary and particularly galling that they can come into this House and pretend that they have never supported levies before. On six occasions they have been in this House, when previously in government, supporting a levy. Up until now, there has never been a levy they did not support. So why is it that they can support a gun levy and they can support a Timor levy but they cannot support a levy to rebuild Queensland and other parts of Australia after the biggest natural disaster in our history?What is even more breathtaking and just demonstrates how out of touch they are, how bizarre they are and, indeed, how crazy they are is that they can argue that we cannot have a levy only months after going around Australia campaigning for a $6 billion levy - the centrepiece of all of their initiatives for the last campaign, $3 billion a year - to fund parental leave. A levy was good enough to fund parental leave in their campaign, but it is not good enough to rebuild Queensland, not good enough to rebuild Australia. This shows that this opposition leader is all opposition and no leadership and that the opposition will play politics at every opportunity. They will not work together as we should, given these natural disasters, to rebuild our country. I say they should put politics aside and help us and the country rebuild Queensland and the rest of Australia.</DOC>

 - As the House is aware, the government have announced our new multicultural strategy. Multiculturalism has strengthened our economy and enriched our society - and it does not detract from our national identity; it adds to it. This government's new policy has been very warmly welcomed in many parts of the community. The Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner, for example, said:It is a policy that commits to fairness, equality and inclusion for all people in Australia.Former Liberal leaders Malcolm Fraser and John Hewson have endorsed the policy in a welcome sign of bipartisanship. I was very pleased to see the Victorian Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship enter into the discussion. He said:_ it is heartening to see the Federal Government is dedicated to a country where all people are treated equally regardless of their cultural or religious background.I think he put it well: 'treated equally' regardless of your religious or political background. Being treated equally means not having your religion attacked by Australia's political leaders. Being treated equally means not having prejudice against your religion used to garner political points. Being treated equally means being treated with respect by all politicians in Australia.Another 24 hours have passed, and the Leader of the Opposition has still not condemned the statements from his own shadow parliamentary secretary. It is reported that in the party room today the Leader of the Opposition said Senator Bernardi had gone 'a little too far'. Senator Bernardi's comments not only warrant a condemnation from the Leader of the Opposition - they demand one. The Leader of the Opposition has launched a crackdown on leaks, but he has refused to condemn public comments from Senator Bernardi. He is tough on leakers and soft on intolerance. The Leader of the Opposition needs to show more leadership on this issue. Malcolm Fraser would have sacked Cory Bernardi. John Hewson would have sacked Cory Bernardi. I suspect even Robert Menzies would have sacked Cory Bernardi. The people of Australia need more leadership and more judgment from their alternative Prime Minister. It is not good enough to say, 'The Liberal Party is a broad church.' No church is broad enough for religious intolerance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question, because it provides the opportunity to correct the record in relation to this particular issue. In fact, since the renewable energy target was in initiated in 2001 by the Howard government, over 100 million renewable energy certificates have been created. As the regulator indicated at Senate estimates this week, since 2001 3½ million renewable energy certificates have not been validated by the regulator. I am advised that some of the reasons for this were errors in the lodgement of RECs in the system. Others have been from the failure to submit the necessary documentation, but the regulator has also indicated in advice that none have been dealt with in this manner due to safety issues emerging.I am advised that the renewable energy certificates subject to this issue are often resubmitted with the proper documentation and are then validated. The Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator checks each batch of RECs to ensure that the legislative requirements are complied with, and the regulator has also been given new enforcement powers by this government through amendments to the legislation in June to maintain a robust compliance system. I am advised that there is nothing new in the level of RECs which are failing the audit process that warrants a special review of this scheme.In this respect, almost a million of the renewable energy certificates that have been invalidated were done so in 2003, during the term of the Howard government, without any specific review of what had happened. The legislation is already subject to biannual reviews, the first of which is due in 2012. What we are seeing here, yet again, is an effort by the opposition to misrepresent facts, to create a scare campaign - and they do not do their detailed policy work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I know she is deeply concerned about health services in her electorate. She covers two very important hospitals, Box Hill and Monash, and I have had cause to visit those hospitals with her as well as to talk to her about health care in her community generally. What the member for Chisholm could say to the House of Representatives is that, over the years that she has represented her electorate in this parliament, the health care for her community was suffering under the Howard government and suffering during the days that the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health and Ageing. Those hospitals, just like hospitals around Australia, were showing the strains that were coming from the percentage of funding coming from the federal government going down and down and down.Indeed, in the days that the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health, the Commonwealth share of public funding fell from 45 per cent to 35 per cent. The Howard government and the Leader of the Opposition were warned four times by the AMA about the chronic underfunding of the system. Then, to add insult to injury, $1 billion was taken out of the public hospital system. This created a pressure for our public hospitals -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I can understand the sensitivity, but there is not enough white-out on the planet to correct the records about the Leader of the Opposition's time as minister for health. - The list of failures goes on. It was not just about funding. There was also the shortage of doctors, nurses and specialists. The Leader of the Opposition and the then Howard government were warned seven times on the shortage of doctors, nine times on the shortage of nurses and three times on the shortage of specialists.What did the Leader of the Opposition do in the face of all of this information? On 16 March 2010 what he finally said was:_ we were about to start tackling the public hospital system when we lost office.This is after five years as Minister for Health and Ageing. He is a man in a hurry - five years and he had finally woken up to the fact that his own conduct had caused a crisis in health. This government is acting to fix the crisis caused by the Leader of the Opposition and that is what our reform agenda is about. Our reform agenda for hospitals is clear and we also have a reform agenda for primary care, because we understand that if you truly want to take pressure off our public hospital system, if you truly want to offer Australians the best possible health care, we need to strengthen primary care, need to strengthen the system that most Australians use, need to strengthen the system that keeps Australians well and out of hospital.That is why today the Minister for Health and Ageing and I have announced that applications are open for the creation of the first 15 Medicare locals, a new system to strengthen primary care. That is why I have determined that there will be more Medicare locals and they will be made available more quickly, that access to after-hours care will be brought forward by two years and be available to people sooner. This is on top of the telephone line to assist people when they have health problems after hours. These are appropriate investments to make a difference for the community. We are still waiting for the answer from the Leader of the Opposition - will he try and block all of this too when it comes to the parliament in legislation? Time for playing politics should be over; let us get on with improving the health care of Australians and delivering our plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question because it gives me an opportunity not only to set the record straight on a number of issues but also to remind the House that the most -  -  - to remind the House of the severe shortage in the nursing profession across the country that was caused by the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to invest in nursing places. - I was simply trying to give a little bit of historical context. -  - The reality is that when we were elected to government one of the first decisions made by our government was to increase the number of training places for nurses, so an extra 1,000 nurses are graduating every single year. That has, of course, led to over 3,500 more nurses being in the system than otherwise would have been. The member for Bowman also referred to the new National Regulatory Registration and Accreditation Scheme introduced by our government which replaces 85 different professional and state and territory boards across the country with one. This is a great reform which is streamlining the system. It is making sure that the very committed nurses, doctors and others who want to work in the Northern Territory where there are no health professionals to help fill a gap or who want to move from Tasmania to Queensland can do so.Of course this was an enormous task, with hundreds of thousands of health professionals moving from individual registration systems for 85 different professions and states and territories into one. If the member had been interested he probably would have seen a statement issued last Thursday by all state and territory health ministers and me as the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing. Having dealt with a range of issues, we invited AHPRA to come to the Health Ministers' Conference. All health ministers across the country are responsible for this system. It is not a Commonwealth system; it is a national system, and we together have taken steps to ensure that some of the teething problems - which were significant in some states but not in others - have been dealt with. What the member might be interested to know -  -  - I will pause for a moment because I think this particular statistic might be sobering for those opposite. At the time that this system came in there was some coverage of there being thousands of medical practitioners - I use that as an example - unable to be registered. It was a very large figure: 7,700. Actually, what has been determined is that, because of attrition, retirement and other factors, only 500 of those doctors were seeking to be re-registered. The fact is we never ever knew any of those statistics previously because 85 different state and territory bodies in each and every different -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I do not need to just tell the member for Bowman what it is that we will do; I can tell the member for Bowman what it is that we have done. On Thursday at the meeting of health ministers, for an item that I took that needed the approval of every state and territory health minister and got that approval, we have agreed across jurisdictions to provide some additional resources - not additional money but some additional people - to make sure that phone calls are being answered even more quickly during this transition time; to make sure that some additional IT expertise is being provided at this transition time; to make sure that there is good follow-up and call-back, whether it is a nurse, a doctor or an allied health professional who needs extra information; and to make sure that more of that can be done online. Those opposite never took the initiative to make sure that people could move between jurisdictions, and we are allowing that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Holt for this question, because he has been very interested in our investments in primary care in particular. Of course, as the Prime Minister has announced, new guidelines have been released today for the establishment of Medicare locals and an application process that I know, on this side of House, many local organisations will be interested in. But this is just another step along the way of the reform that we have been committed to since we were elected to government. We are investing more than $2 billion into primary care, into our GP superclinics, into training more GPs, into employing more practice nurses and into building and upgrading more clinics.I suspect the member for Holt is particularly pleased to ask this question because he, amongst other members in this House, has already seen these results being delivered locally in his electorate. We announced $64.5 million of investments to upgrade existing GP clinics. Two hundred and forty grants across the country have been let, and these are grants of up to $500,000 to allow for the expansion of GP services, new training rooms or new equipment. For example, in the Cranbourne News the member for Holt is shown shaking hands with the GP Dr Alan Lim from First Health Medical Centre, which received $500,000. I have not seen or heard the member for Tangney talk about a report in the Canning Times, 'Windfall for health care'. I know that the member for Corio was pleased to see 'Doctor boost for Drysdale', an announcement in his electorate. The member for Mallee would no doubt be pleased that the GP clinic in his electorate that has put in a funding proposal for half a million dollars has also been in negotiations. In Fremantle, there is the announcement 'Federal windfall to boost health services'; I know the member for Fremantle would be very happy about that. The member for Blair, one of the members who have an operational GP superclinic providing services - in Ipswich - will also be pleased that in his electorate there are funds to boost other medical services. Of course, there is the member for Kingston. The list goes on.The point is that, at the same time as we are investing in additional services for GP practices across the country, we are investing in rural health services and we are investing in Indigenous health services. Today we have taken the next step: investing in primary care to ensure that it can be properly coordinated so that the services of GPs and other health professionals can be wrapped around the needs of a patient rather than the patient being expected to run around for the needs of the health system. This is something which will deliver fundamental change and provide better services throughout the community.I am very proud to have visited a GP practice here in Canberra. I know that the member for Canberra was pleased that we visited one of the very good health services here in Canberra and talked to Dr Annie Lim about her hopes and vision for being able to get more help. The words she said to the Prime Minister and me were very simple. She said: 'As a GP I can do a lot, but I can't do everything on my own. I have a great hope that this will make it easier to provide better services to my patients.' I can tell Dr Lim, as well as every other doctor and nurse across the country who wants to work in primary care, that we are determined to invest more in getting early services online, better after-hours services, more GPs and all of the things that the Leader of Opposition said during the election that he would cut funding for. We are investing, we are delivering and the community is already starting to see it.</DOC>

 - I have to say I have heard everything now. The member for Solomon knows full well that the GP superclinic, which I visited on Friday last week to officially open it, is not only operating with four GPs, with registrars and with nurses but is also co-located with the after-hours service which is funded by the Northern Territory government and, in fact, has been for more than two years; it is a 24-hour service. The Leader of the Opposition -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition might care to listen to this answer, because it is very embarrassing for his own backbencher. When I was there on Friday, I took the opportunity to pursue the issue that the member has been raising. What I thought would be a really good thing to do was to see where I would arrive at the superclinic if it were at a point in time after the superclinic had closed its doors, what the referral system would be and what I could say -  - It is a very embarrassing question for the member, because -  - The member for Solomon would know that there is a sign at the door which makes absolutely clear that the after-hours service is currently provided by the co-located community health service. I walked the distance that it takes - 124 steps, and I am not a tall person - and it is not a very difficult way to get to that after-hours service. - The reason those opposite are so sensitive about this is because thousands of residents in Palmerston have for more than two years been provided with services that otherwise they would have to travel across all of Darwin to get to the Royal Darwin Hospital for. This is because no after-hours services were provided in Palmerston.Those opposite might do a bit of homework and pull out the announcements which made clear that the Northern Territory government was funding the after-hours service, that the GP superclinic would be built and that ultimately they would be co-located. The negotiations are currently underway between the Northern Territory government and the provider of the superclinic. - If any other member in this House would like to take more time than the member for Solomon has taken -  -  - they would find out that this service has provided over 20,000 valuable services to residents of Palmerston, and was enthusiastically welcomed when it was officially opened on Friday.Charles Darwin University and the Flinders Medical School are training health professionals of the future right where Palmerston residents are getting services throughout the day and after hours. The member for Solomon should be ashamed that as their representative she is not prepared to stand up and say that this is a service that is providing benefits to her residents in Darwin.Both the member for Boothby and the member for Sturt might read Practice. This occupant of the chair would not be the first person who has not offered somebody the call on the basis that they are seeking a point of order. The member for Menzies has been at the end of that with the present Speaker, so it is not the first time that I have not done it. We understand these things; but I simply say that, in toto, the picking and choosing of standing orders that are important is miraculous. When people can ignore the fact that nobody except those who have the call are to make a statement or an interjection, I find it incredible that then they want to find my cooperation on all occasions.Let us get the facts straight: the member for Solomon's point of order was not a point of order.Ad nauseam, I have suggested that the same standing order should apply to answers as applies to the questions. It would have been a much better solution than 'directly relevant'. It would have meant that question time is not about the debate; you can have the debate on other occasions.I am happy to entertain discussions about that, but I am also of a mind that the amount of banter that goes on - I agree, from both sides of the chamber - could well be reduced, and question time could revert - if it has ever been - to an occasion when it has been about the discussion and debate on the matters of ideas rather than personalities. I would agree that the amount of debate that is in the answers is a big part of the problem that any occupant of the chair confronts. Something which I have been consistent on is that I cannot fathom why the House does not contemplate applying the same rules to the answers as it does to the questions. The member for Boothby then left the chamber.

 - I thank the member for his question. HMAS Success is a supply ship used for the supply of fuel, ammunition, food and stores to naval units at sea. In March 2009 Success left Sydney for a deployment to South-East Asia and China, including the Philippines, China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Between March and May 2009, incidents of unacceptable behaviour were brought to the attention of Command. Allegations included: inappropriate conduct towards women, including predatory sexual behaviour; workforce bullying and intimidation; tribal culture on board the ship; drunken and disreputable behaviour while ashore; a breakdown in discipline; and serious failures of command.These incidents were the subject of an internal Defence inquiry, a Senate estimates examination and a Senate inquiry. In March 2010 the Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, commissioned Roger Gyles QC to conduct an independent inquiry into these matters. Last month I received Mr Gyles's report. The report is not a good read. The report makes very sorry and confronting reading about the failure of personal conduct, about the failure of discipline, about the failure of authority and about the inappropriate culture aboard the Success. Mr Gyles also concluded that the decision to land senior sailors after allegations were made against them was flawed in various respects and was not the result of proper processes. A second report by Mr Gyles will deal with these general Defence processes.At the end of my answer I propose to table an edited or redacted version of Mr Gyles's report. The redactions are made on legal advice to prevent the identification of individuals who may be the subject of disciplinary or other procedures.I have provided a copy of the full report in confidence to Senator Mark Bishop, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee; the deputy chair of that committee, Senator Trood; the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee, Senator Kroger; and Senator Johnston, the shadow minister for defence. This satisfies the undertakings made by my predecessor, Senator Faulkner, to keep the Senate fully informed of these matters.In holding a commission of inquiry, it was intended to fully expose the facts and matters Defence and Navy were dealing with. In my view, the report clearly does this. The Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Navy have accepted the findings, recommendations and conclusions of the report in full. The Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Navy are taking action on all of Mr Gyles's recommendations. An action plan has been developed to address the issues identified in the report and Defence's response will be based on the key themes of leadership, culture, alcohol misuse and behaviour while ashore. This plan will be implemented alongside the program already being implemented by the Chief of Navy: the New Generation Navy program.Regrettably, the report outlines unacceptable behaviour that falls beneath community standards, unacceptable behaviour and conduct that falls beneath the standards of a modern navy and that falls beneath the standards of the Australian Defence Force. Such behaviour will not be tolerated by the Chief of the Defence Force, will not be tolerated by the Chief of Navy and will certainly not be tolerated by the men and women in the Australian community.I table a report by Roger Gyles QC, HMAS Success Commission of Inquiry - Allegations of unacceptable behaviour and the management thereof - part one: the Asian deployment and immediate aftermath.</DOC>

He would be well aware that work is underway to ensure that it will be delivered to all those people who require that information prior to their training. We will continue to deliver the necessary reforms in that area, as we have in others.

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and for her commitment to paid parental leave in Australia. On 1 January this year, paid parental leave was introduced into Australia for the first time. For the first time after decades of waiting, Australia finally caught up with the rest of the developed world and this Labor government delivered paid parental leave. Paid parental leave is now giving Australia's babies the best start that they need in life, giving their parents the sort of financial security that they deserve and making sure that parents can stay at home with their newborn babies in those very important early months of life. Over 22,000 expectant and new parents have already put in their application forms and we now have 2,200 parents -  - It is typical of the opposition, who have opposed paid parental leave for so long and it was left up to this Labor government to deliver. We have now got 2,200 parents who are being paid paid parental leave. On New Year's Day, the Prime Minister and I visited a mother who had just given birth that morning. She was so pleased that she had paid parental leave because, as she said to the Prime Minister and me, it meant that she would not have to work for up to a year. She knew the full value of paid parental leave to her and her family.It is not just mothers and fathers who are pleased with paid parental leave; it is also business. Business is very pleased with the benefits that are coming to them from paid parental leave being delivered by this government. We have 2,500 employers already signed up to provide government funded parental leave pay to their long-term employees and more than half of those employers have opted to provide payments earlier than the 1 July start date for this part of the payment arrangements.We have got small business opting into this arrangement at the same rate as bigger businesses. We have got employers already making the payments. I want to make this very clear to everyone in this House: employers are already making payments to their long-term employees and they are telling us how easy and straightforward it is. We have small businesses ringing up the Centrelink business hotline saying that they have had no problems with the scheme.Of course, we know that those opposite just want to continue with their normal wrecking ways. We see the opposition trying to bring legislation in that would wreck the smooth introduction of this part of the scheme. But we know that parents are not fooled by the political games that those opposite are playing. Mums and dads and employers know that paid parental leave is good for families and is good for business, and it is the Labor government that has delivered it.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As I indicated to the House yesterday, we are making some $38 million available to the War Memorial in this financial year, which is on par with earlier allocations. I am concerned about funding for the War Memorial. Consequently, some time ago, I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to work with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and, of course, with the Australian War Memorial itself - its council and leadership - on budget matters and to report back to me. Because I asked for that review some time ago, that review is nearly complete. When the government has that review, we will look at its recommendations and act.Of course, all Australians want to see the War Memorial properly resourced. I do. That is why I asked quite some time ago for the review and that is why the review will report back to me. Through a proper process of assessing the War Memorial's needs, we will deal with its budget matters for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. On indulgence I was able to update the House on our efforts to assist New Zealand, but I did, on a day like today, want to speak about the depth of the relationship between our two countries.Last week I had the very great honour of being the first Australian Prime Minister - indeed, the first leader of any foreign nation - to address the members of the New Zealand parliament. It was a great occasion on which to reflect on the bonds between our two countries. On that occasion I said the following to the members of the New Zealand parliament:In the 1890s, there was a possibility that New Zealand and Australia might formally have joined their destinies to each other.A relic of that aspiration even remains in our Constitution to this day.But it was never necessary.Our founders could not have imagined the extraordinary events that would bring our nations far closer than any words or any laws.Not forged in meeting rooms by old men wearing suits.But by young men in trenches wearing slouch hats and lemon squeezers.That is why I say Australia has many alliances and friendships around the world.Economic and defence partnerships of every kind.But New Zealand alone is family.When those 29 men never came home from the Pike River mine, we didn't just mourn for the two Australians.We mourned for them all.Family.When Pike River exploded, New Zealand didn't have to ask Australia to send help.We just did.And when natural disasters hit Australia this summer, New Zealand didn't need to be asked to lend a hand.You just did.And our gratitude is boundless.When I spoke those words, I could not have foreseen that so shortly afterwards we would be returning to help New Zealand in its hour of need.I want to take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record the words that New Zealand Prime Minister John Key has spoken to the New Zealand parliament today about circumstances in his nation. He said:To the people of Christchurch: we feel your pain, as only a small nation can, for none of us feel removed from this event.Mr Key went on to say:I am a proud son of Christchurch. I was raised there, I got my first job there, my sister lives there, my mother died there, I know what a wonderful place it is.But my connection to Christchurch is no rare thing.All New Zealanders have a piece of our heart in Christchurch.All of our lives are touched by this event.Those are Mr Key's words to the New Zealand parliament. I believe we can say in this parliament: all of our lives are touched by this event, too. Mr Key went on to say:Today I want Christchurch to hear this message:You will get through this.This proud country is right behind you and we are backing you with all our might.The world is with us.Our Australian neighbours, our British and American friends, the great countries of this world, all are putting their shoulder to your wheel. They are sending their support, their expertise, their people to help us _And we are. He went on to say that this was the start of the long journey of recovery and that New Zealand would walk that journey with the people of Christchurch. Australia will walk that journey with the people of Christchurch, too.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow - Treasurer. Sorry, they confuse me over there with their twists and turns. I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. To the shadow Treasurer I would say this: the only political party in contemporary politics that has gone to an election making a false claim about interest rates is the Liberal Party of Australia when it campaigned on keeping interest rates at record lows and then interest rates went up and up and up. What I would also say to the shadow Treasurer, and I do not know if this has passed him by, is that in open market economies like the Australian economy we believe in the power of competition. I know that might be news to the shadow Treasurer. He has never heard of an open market economy, he has never heard of competition, and all of these things are confusing him. But I believe that, in an open market economy, competition is good. Consequently, I believe that, if you can remove impediments that stop people from using their competitive power and pressure as consumers to get a better deal, then that is a good thing. It is obviously anticompetition to chain people to banking products they no longer want through unfair exit fees. It obviously is a bad thing. I would say that the proof of the pudding has been in the eating. - I would rather speak sense slowly than be a gabbling idiot, but there we have it. On the question of speaking sense slowly to the shadow Treasurer, I believe in competition. Therefore, if you remove impediments to competition, that is a good thing. The proof of the pudding has been in the eating. We are already seeing, as a result of the signals about banking competition that have come from this government, banks out there offering more competitive products, including no more exit fees. I do not understand the shadow Treasurer's case to the Australian people, but I presume he is on the cusp of producing a bumper sticker that says: 'Vote Liberal and get unfair banking exit fees.' That would be a good bumper sticker. - I recommend it to the shadow Treasurer if he really thinks that is good for Australian families. What I think is good for Australian families is being able to shop around for a mortgage product. What I think is good for Australian families is being able to say, with force and meaning, to their bank, 'If I don't get a good deal from you, I'm going to go down the road and get a better deal.' What I think is in the interests of Australian families is that banks go in hard, go in competitively and go in with better and better and more and more competitive products. That is why we are opposed to these kinds of bank exit fees. I presume the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer support them. I will leave that to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I note that he was born in New Zealand and that, in fact, his brother works in our embassy in Wellington. He is no doubt extremely busy in these trying times. The tragedy in Christchurch has come on top of an earlier tragedy of last September. As has been expressed, our sentiments go out to our friends across the Tasman. As the Prime Minister has indicated, there are 65 confirmed casualties, but, unfortunately, there are also estimated to be about 300 people missing, so it is likely that that casualty figure, regrettably, will go up.As at 10.30 this morning, the New Zealand Prime Minister, as our Prime Minister has indicated, has with John Carter, the Minister of Civil Defence, declared a state of national emergency in New Zealand. That is the first time that such a state of national emergency has been declared for a natural disaster. It was indicated that that course of action was taken to ensure the maximum cooperation and coordination between national and local resources but also to accommodate the international assistance that is coming into New Zealand.As the Prime Minister has indicated, we have one search-and-rescue team on the ground now. They are self-contained. They take about 20 tonnes of equipment, their expertise and rescue dogs. It appears from reports that they have already had one success with a survivor being pulled from a demolished building. They will be joined in the next few hours by a second team, from Queensland - the first team being from New South Wales. That will make a significant contribution. I acknowledge also the willingness of other states to provide assistance and their preparedness, if you like, to cover for the resources we may require in Australia should a disaster occur.Through the emergency management liaison officers, we have identified that a medical assistance team is required. That has been assembled: six emergency management department directors, six emergency management department nurses, six clinical nurses and one orthopaedic and general surgeon. In addition, we are assembling a 75-bed field hospital of six surgical and medical support staff. Also we have indicated, as the Prime Minister noted, our ability to assist with policing, with a 300-member police squad made up of Australian Federal Police officers, but also contributions from the states and territories will be deployed this Friday.I assure honourable members that the sentiments expressed by the House have been communicated to our counterparts in New Zealand. In a statement issued at about 12 noon today in the New Zealand parliament, John Carter, the Minister of Civil Defence, paid tribute to Australian search-and-rescue parties, who are already on the ground. He noted that assistance is also on the way from the United States, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Japan and Taiwan. Clearly, we have a close relationship with our New Zealand friends and family, as has been noted, but no more so than in the emergency management space, where they are always the first on the ground to assist us. It is entirely appropriate that we provide the assistance that has been endorsed overwhelmingly by all sides of this House.</DOC>

 - In answer to the shadow Treasurer's question, let me adopt the following words and quote them to him because I think they are very wise words. They come from a member of the coalition, one of his Senate colleagues, Senator Williams. He said:For 18 months now I have called for the abolition of exit fees on variable loans. When the banks raise their fees, and last December we saw Westpac and St George raise their fees more than the Reserve Bank did -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and once again I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and his point of order - not much gets past him! It was a remarkable display of intellectual agility in this parliament today; I am glad we have been treated to it by the shadow Treasurer. Let me quote the words of one of his coalition colleagues. I presume they are not so fundamentally divided today that they are unwilling to listen to each other's words. Senator Williams's words go on. He said in respect of banking:Treasurer Wayne Swan is saying vote with their feet. How can you vote with your feet when you've got to pay an exit fee to get out of your loan? The sooner the government abolishes exit fees and also establishment fees, the banks can still add those fees onto their margins, then we can have proper competition in the banking industry.Proposition No. 1: competition is good; proposition No. 2: competition leads to better products for consumers. I do not understand what part of those two propositions the shadow Treasurer is struggling with so badly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. The 24-hour consular crisis centre of the Department of Foreign Affairs commenced operation at one o'clock yesterday afternoon, two hours after the earthquake hit. To update the figures that the Prime Minister gave the House just before, as at 12.45 today we have had just under 7,000 calls, we have registered just under 2,400 cases, we have confirmed that 937 Australians are safe and we are seeking to confirm the safety of a further 1,352. We have also - through the Deputy Head of Mission, who was in Christchurch at the time of the earthquake with two embassy staff - established an Australian crisis centre at the Copthorne Hotel Commodore, which is located on the road between the central business district and the airport. The Deputy Head Of Mission there has said that in the course of this morning we have had dozens of Australians call in. They have been provided with all forms of assistance in terms of travel advice, a cup of tea and a shoulder to cry on in some cases. They have been through a really ugly time.Our temporary crisis centre in Christchurch has had a meeting with 50 local hotel and tourism operators in order to make sure that their Australian customers know of arrangements being made for return flights back to Australia or elsewhere domestically within New Zealand. The temporary crisis centre has also made arrangements for local radio announcements to this effect.As far as the Australian casualties are concerned, I would add to what the Prime Minister said before in two respects. The first is that we have concerns for an additional three Australians who are known to have been in the downtown area at the time of the earthquake and who, as of today, have not yet been located. The second is that we have been advised of a woman who made telephone contact with the media in Melbourne, and she did so from a building which had collapsed. We have, of course, sought to immediately contact her on that telephone number - but without success. We have therefore immediately provided to the search and rescue authorities the details as described of the building in which she was located. That search is ongoing.Further, I inform the House about flight arrangements back to Australia. The Prime Minister has addressed this matter in terms of commercial flights back to Australia through Qantas. We are also making the opportunity available for flights through to other domestic locations in New Zealand as well as Auckland. We are supplementing consular staff at Auckland Airport in order to assist people there for onward flights back to Australia. The use of RAAF flights is as the Prime Minister mentioned before. I spoke to our high commissioner in New Zealand just before question time. He is currently at Christchurch Airport assisting in what is a fairly chaotic situation - there are thousands of people there. He and Australian consular staff are at the airport and assisting with the mechanical arrangements of getting people onto commercial or RAAF flights.I also spoke to Foreign Minister McCully before question time. He made the point, as I think the Attorney-General did in his remarks to the House just before, that the government of New Zealand really appreciates what has been done here. The capacity which the Attorney-General has organised through his state colleagues is being deployed immediately. It is really needed on the ground, and these efforts have been deeply appreciated by our Kiwi cousins. Furthermore, he has reiterated the appreciation for all the expressions of solidarity and support that they have received not just from across the Tasman but also from elsewhere. We and the department will of course keep the House and the country updated on further consular developments.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. On this side of the House we believe that putting in place a carbon price is the most efficient way to reduce carbon pollution and make our economy much more competitive in the long term. If we do not get the investment, particularly in the energy sector, then prices will be far higher. If we do not get the investment in the energy sector, particularly when it comes to electricity generation, then we will face a future with an economy which is less competitive and prices that are higher than they otherwise would have been. Of that there is no doubt. But those on that side of the House will go to any lengths to run a scare campaign about the introduction of a carbon price and any lengths not to face up to this very big challenge for Australia. - Of course I could not confirm that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I think it is important to acknowledge that the member for Kennedy has been absolutely consistent in his objection to dairy deregulation ever since it was first introduced by a National Party minister at the time and, in fairness, introduced with the support of both sides of parliament at the time.It should be made clear, and I do have some information here from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, that lower milk prices should not be at the cost of Australian dairy farmers. I am pleased that Coles have publicly confirmed that they are honouring their assurances that these price reductions would not drive down farm gate prices for dairy farmers. - If the members of the National Party who are interjecting want to pretend that it was not their own leader who was the minister for agriculture when dairy deregulation came in, then go right ahead. I think that both sides should be consistent in acknowledging that the person who has been consistent in his objection to dairy deregulation is actually the member for Kennedy. I think that members of the National Party should just own up to that.Ian McLeod, the managing director of Coles, has written to members of parliament and published in the media that, when Coles renegotiated milk supply contracts in January of this year, the dairy processors received higher prices. The government does expect that dairy processors pass these price increases back onto dairy farmers.The question also deals with some very serious issues relating to mental health situations in rural and remote communities. Mental health is an issue of deep sensitivity to all members in this House, and a major issue for Australians in any time of crisis - particularly in those areas which have been through natural disasters. We refer to cyclones and floods, but are all very mindful of what happened among the farming community in particular during the long period of the drought, and the member for Kennedy has referred to those issues directly.The Australian government does provide a range of initiatives and social support services for farmers. Front line service providers, including Centrelink's rural service offices, are often the first point of contact for farmers or their families. They provide referrals to support services and to local social workers and specialists. The Australian government also has its National Suicide Prevention Strategy supporting suicide prevention initiatives at both the state and national levels.Those mental health issues leading to suicide are always incredibly complex. There are always a range of issues that can affect them, financial pressure very regularly being one of them. I acknowledge the support for those measures from members of all sides of the House, but also acknowledge the particular links that the member for Kennedy has made for a long period of time on that issue. - </DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Fraser for a very important question. It is simply stunning, and an indicator of just how out of touch and unrealistic those opposite have become, that a question about the growth in the global economy should produce that reaction from them. The fact is that they have just become so divorced from reality and the issues that really matter to average Australians that in this House they are not capable of behaving in a proper manner.Growth is going to be stronger than we would have thought a year ago. That is very clear from the meeting of G20 finance ministers that I attended on the weekend. It was a good opportunity to take the temperature, if you like, of the global economy and to assess its ramifications for our country.Asian economies are likely to grow strongly, and that is a very good thing for Australia. Also, the US economy and its outlook are more optimistic at the moment than they have been for some time. But I have to tell members of the House that the European outlook is not great. There is very sluggish growth in Europe, and of course on top of that we now have instability in the Middle East and North Africa. That will certainly weigh on global markets, and it will certainly push oil prices higher.But this does give an opportunity to reflect on where Australia is vis a vis the rest of the world. Output in this country has grown something like five per cent since the global financial crisis, whereas many countries around the world are still struggling to get back to the levels they experienced prior to the global financial crisis. You can see this immense difference between Australia and many other countries in our unemployment rates. Unemployment in this country, at five per cent, is around half of unemployment in the euro zone at around 10 per cent. And, of course, in the United States it is stuck stubbornly at nine per cent.It is a great thing for our country that in these circumstances, given this outlook, we have been able to produce in excess of 700,000 jobs in the period that we have been in government. It is something that everybody on this side of the House is absolutely proud of, because it means pay packets going into households and it means breadwinners who are able to provide for their families in a way which we are not seeing across so many other developed economies. And, of course, our net debt, compared to other economies, is low, at 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12, compared to 90 per cent of GDP in major advanced economies in 2015 and, of course, coming back to surplus in 2012-13. So we have an underlying economic strength that is not evident in so many other developed economies.Of course, there are patchy parts of our economy, and we have seen today that non-residential construction is a little weak. Consumers in our economy remain cautious and, on top of that, we have had some of the worst natural disasters in our history. But, to counter all of that, we have a very, very strong investment pipeline to support growth in our economy and to support rebuilding as we go forward, and we are making investments in critical economic infrastructure, particularly the NBN, which is absolutely important to the productivity of our economy and future growth. We are engaged in health reform. We are building up a pool of national savings to make sure that we can deal with the consequences of the mining boom. These are all things which will secure the prosperity of our country, and we on this side of the House have a plan to broaden and strengthen our economy - unlike those on the other side of the House, who are all opposition and no policy.</DOC>

 - I am not sure what it is that has come upon the opposition in recent days and is particularly on evidence today, but they seem to be in denial of all of the fundamentals of economics, particularly market economics. Maybe since they started using One Nation to generate their budget figures they have lost any understanding of what makes a competitive, modern economy. It follows from basic economic principles - and the economic commentary about this is wide in Australia; it is worldwide - that the most efficient way of dealing with carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. Why? It is because it causes people to innovate, to reduce their exposure to that price and to reduce the amount of carbon pollution that they are generating. This is simply not capable of being denied. It is the same as trying to deny that demand and supply have an impact on prices. It is a basic economic rule.Consequently, I have said in this parliament that we will work with people of goodwill through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to put a price on carbon. I know that sitting amongst the coalition are people who would prefer to be part of that process - who accept the science, who accept that pricing carbon is the most economically efficient way to do it and who were prepared to work with the government in pricing carbon under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said, we will use the opportunities of this parliament, and I know there are many coalition members who want to join us to work on pricing carbon. To the Leader of the Opposition, what I can say is this: the Leader of the Opposition completely misunderstands the purpose of economic modelling. You do not throw into economic modelling a general proposition that pricing carbon discourages carbon pollution and is an economically efficient strategy and ask it to spit something back out. Economic modelling is for the purpose of diagnosing and looking at a particular price. You would not go to an economic model and say, 'If I constrict supply of a commodity, will the price go up?' An economic model will tell you that if you constrict supply by 10 per cent then you can anticipate the following price effect. That is what economic modelling is for.So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: I know that he is grossly embarrassed by his weathervane approach to climate change. - I know that his colleagues are grossly embarrassed at sitting behind a man who believed in the climate science and then said it was absolute crap, who believed in pricing carbon and then was opposed to pricing carbon, and who then believed again in pricing carbon and then was opposed again to pricing carbon. I know that that is grossly embarrassing for the opposition. - What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is: do not come to this parliament with these economic absurdities. All you are doing is trashing the brand of the Liberal Party. It is actually pathetic to watch.We have not conducted full economy-wide modelling of the carbon price.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question. Of course to tackle climate change we need to cut carbon pollution. As our economy grows -  -  - To tackle climate change, the simple fact of the matter is that we need to cut carbon pollution in our economy. As our economy grows we have to ensure that pollution does not grow with it. The fact of the matter is that a carbon price through a market mechanism is the most cost-effective way of cutting pollution in our economy. A carbon price will cut pollution, it will drive investment in clean energy and it will provide business certainty for investment, especially in the energy sector.This week the Australian Industry Group released an important report about energy prices. The report echoes the government's view that a carbon price is needed in our economy. The AIG report is in fact clear that energy prices have already risen significantly and that they are set to rise further with or without a carbon price; but, importantly, the report emphasises that a carbon price could, in fact, help reduce the impact of future electricity price rises. The report makes clear that electricity price rises are occurring because of the tens of billions of dollars of investment that are necessary in our electricity distribution infrastructure. In fact, on that point the Australian Energy Market Operator has estimated that we will need up to $120 billion of investment over the next 20 years in our electricity network.The AIG report makes clear that without the certainty delivered by a carbon price we are going to see higher electricity prices due to poor investments being made. To answer some of the interjections from the other side, I will quote from the report. It says in the section attributed to the CEO of the Australian Industry Group:_ while much concern has focussed on carbon pricing, energy prices are going up significantly with or without it. Some of those cost drivers could be reduced by a well-designed carbon price. This could eliminate the policy uncertainty that is damaging investment in new electricity generation _ - The message which echoes the position that the government has been articulating for some period of time is that not only is a carbon price needed to resolve the uncertainty for investors in the energy sector but it will, in fact, mitigate price pressures in the electricity market for some time to come. This is something that it would be useful for the opposition to understand. We have before us a Liberal Party that does not understand markets and a Liberal Party leader who does not understand the allocative efficiency of markets. -  - You do not need modelling to tell you that markets allocate resources efficiently and that a market mechanism is going to be the most effective way of pricing carbon in our economy. It is a message you should take on and understand.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to receive that question because, as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency have said, a carbon price is the cheapest and most efficient way of dealing with carbon pollution. That is economics 101, which is not understood by anybody across the chamber. It is understood by the member for Wentworth, who nods his head at the irresponsible behaviour of all of those people over there. The member for Wentworth understood this when he agreed with the government on that fundamental proposition in this House just over one year ago. Just over one year ago the Liberal Party were in this House and they believed in the proposition that I just put to the parliament. That was suspended and all economic rationality went out the door when this Leader of the Opposition took the job. He has now suspended the fundamental rules of economics. We have seen it in here, whether in the debate on the carbon price, their lack of understanding of the need to get rid of unfair mortgage exit fees or their failure to understand debt and deficit in the economy. We see it time and time again. Not only are they economically irresponsible but they have become economically irrational. - That is what is on display in this House question time after question time. They make a lot of modelling. There has been a lot of modelling done about putting a price on carbon. Let us start with the Stern report and go through model after model all based on that fundamental proposition. - They were making a lot of modelling and they have quoted some modelling which is contained in one report. The answer is it depends on the design of the scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the great port city of Newcastle for her question. Freight volumes will double between now and 2030, so there is an urgent need for national leadership and long-term planning. That is why the government asked Infrastructure Australia to develop a national freight strategy and yesterday, at the Australian Logistics Council, I released the draft of that strategy. We encourage input between now and April. Just like with the port strategy, we will have a process of consultation with industry and the community to make sure that we get this long-term planning right.Our vision is for a truly national, integrated and multimodal transport system capable of moving freight quickly, reliably and efficiently. That is not the end in itself. The end itself is increased export earnings, decreased costs to consumers and increased productivity, leading to increased economic growth. This strategy is a plan for the next three decades, not just for the next three years. It is a plan which anticipates rather than merely reacts to bottlenecks and capacity constraints.There are some specific ideas canvassed there: local planning laws to prevent urban encroachment on vital road and rail corridors, establishing dedicated freight routes, separating passenger trains from freight trains, more intermodals to improve access to rail and using smart infrastructure to get more productivity out of the infrastructure which is there at the moment, as well as moving to single national regulators in rail, heavy vehicle and maritime. At the moment we have 23 transport regulators for Australia's 22 million people. We will move that to three and the Prime Minister advanced that process at the recent COAG meeting. It has been endorsed by the Australian Logistics Council, the Australian Trucking Association, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, Engineers Australia, the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils and many other industry organisations in the last 24 hours. There has been one area of opposition, and we know who that will be.As well as planning for the future we are also responding to Australia's immediate infrastructure needs. As the member for Newcastle knows, we have rebuilt in our first term one-third of the interstate rail freight network. New figures from BITRE, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, confirm an equal commitment to building and investing in roads. During our first full year in office we invested a record $4.9 billion in the nation's roads, which was up 80 per cent on the coalition's records - indeed, the biggest investment since the creation of the national road network, of course again by a Labor government, almost 40 years ago. It is quite clear that we need to continue to invest, but it is also clear we need the right policy framework. This draft national freight strategy is just that and I encourage industry and the community to participate in this process.</DOC>

 - First of all, I do not accept that for one second -  - and certainly not from the member for Dawson. We are now in this extraordinary position where all of those in the opposition, the Liberal and National parties, believe this fundamental proposition that the mining industry pays too much tax. Can anyone believe that? That is what they believe on that side of the House: the mining industry pays too much tax. We have the terms of trade at 140-year highs and there are record prices for iron ore and coal. It is only fair that, in those circumstances, where the price for these commodities is going to be higher historically, the Australian people receive fair value for the resources they own 100 per cent.Who would oppose that proposition? The Liberal and National parties. We on this side of the House are determined to see that the Australians who own those resources 100 per cent - and these resources can only be dug up once - get some fair value for them. That is why we are putting in place our rent tax, which, extraordinarily, is opposed by the Liberal and National parties. It is actually supported by large sections of the mining industry, but opposed only in total by the Liberal and National parties in this House - demonstrating yet again just how out of control, how bizarre and how weird they have become in their approach to public policy. How could you oppose the Australian people, when prices are at 140-year highs, actually getting a fair return? -  - The Liberal and National parties can, just as they are opposing the abolition of unfair mortgage exit fees, which are locking Australian mortgage holders into loans with banks they do not want to be with. How irrational could you be? And the list goes on and on: opposing the NBN -  - But we on this side of the House -  -  - It is well documented that the biggest factor influencing electricity prices at the moment is transmission network charges and distribution - well documented. But those on that side of the House are so embarrassed by their opposition to the MRRT and the benefits it will bring to their electorates -  - that they have to get to this completely irrational position.Leave not granted.</DOC>

She, along with many others on this side of the House, knows that, if we care for people better in the community, we can reduce our rate of hospitalisations - which, unfortunately, in Australia are much higher than the OECD average. It is estimated that some nine per cent of hospitalisations are potentially preventable.Obviously that is why the Prime Minister and I are focusing on moving more emphasis onto primary care and, as the House knows, released yesterday guidelines for the Medicare locals that will increase and improve coordination for primary healthcare service providers. I must say that we have been pleased with the reaction that we have had to this announcement, including from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. The president, John Kolbe, said yesterday:If fully utilised, Medicare Locals can vastly improve how health care is planned and delivered, directly impacting patient outcomes by ensuring increased access to treatment in more appropriate settings.That is absolutely what we are trying to do.At the same time as trying to coordinate primary care better, we are also investing in building new infrastructure across the country. So I am pleased to be able to inform the House that on Friday the member for Page is going to be turning the first sod for a GP superclinic to be constructed in Grafton. There will be five full-time GPs in this clinic, together with practice nurses and allied health professionals, pathology collection and pharmacy services. - So as of this Friday, when the sod is turned by the member for Page, there will be 30 GP superclinics that are open and fully operational - there are nine of those - providing early services or under construction, and that is with almost two years of our five-year program actually still to run. - So all these clinics have been established with consultation in the community on what services are needed. I know that the member for Dickson is getting agitated, as he always does when we talk about superclinics. - I would like to give him an update about the superclinic in his electorate, which he, as yet, has failed to visit. The Strathpine GP Super Clinic has provided 92,000 items of care to patients through 71,000 consultations. Services are provided after hours; the clinic employs 15 GPs, nine nurses, a physiotherapist, a podiatrist and a pathologist and provides chiropractic care and mental health services; and all GP consultations are bulk-billed. I am also happy to inform the House that the Strathpine clinic has now employed its first nurse practitioner. They are benefiting from the government's reforms to the MBS. In particular, this nurse practitioner is going to be working closely with three local nursing homes who have not been able to get services from other practices. So this is good news for the community, and it is about time the member for Dickson gave them a visit.</DOC>

 - I am delighted I have received another question on this from the Leader of the Opposition because, yet again, it just confirms the nonsense that comes from those opposite. The government is determined to put a price on carbon and for that we say this is an essential economic reform and that it must be done. Those opposite want to run around and pretend there is some cost-free way of dealing with climate change. They want to pretend that if we do not deal with climate change nothing will happen. But we all know that the cost of not acting on climate change is far higher than the cost of acting. That is point No. 1.They want to pretend that they have some scheme to deal with reducing carbon pollution. They have a series of proposals that they took to the last election but every report that has come out - including the one from industry this week - proves that their direct action and intervention will actually make prices higher than if we introduced a carbon price. That is why we say that a carbon price is the cheapest and most efficient way of addressing carbon pollution. It is the cheapest and most efficient way.What those opposite have on offer is an alternative which will provide for higher prices. They stand up and ask, 'What's the design of the scheme?' We are working our way through designing that with a multiparty committee. Of course, that is not a secret. The multiparty committee is meeting every couple of weeks. Those opposite sit in this House and pretend that that is news. It is not news. We are determined to move towards a price on carbon because it is a fundamental economic reform in this country which will secure our prosperity for the future and mean that we will be able to generate the jobs and wealth that Australian families and industry expect.What do we get in the face of that? We get more of this opposition of opposition's sake because they think they can put their own political interests before the national interest. For our part, when it comes to responding to responding to natural disasters and when it comes to dealing with the challenges of mining boom mark 2 we will always put the national interest first.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She represents a great industrial area of Australia - a high-skill area - and that is very important to Australia's economic future. That reminds us that 30 years ago, in the very early 1980s, Australia had a big choice to make: would it continue as an economy behind high tariff walls, protected, to sell products onto a fragmented, small market or would it create an open, competitive economy - open up our trade and open up our business so that we could take on the rest of the world as exporters and win? That choice was made by the Hawke Labor government. The Hawke government decided that it would fashion an open, competitive economy.This was a monumental change - a fundamental refashioning of the Australian economy. As a result of the reforms of the Hawke government and the Keating government, through national competition policy, the foundations were laid for 20 years of sustained economic growth. I will acknowledge that the Howard government, in the area of industry protection through tariffs, also continued that process of reducing those tariff barriers.I am asked now about the impact on economic reform of investing in skills in this country. The decision that was made nearly 30 years ago was a decision as to whether we stayed as a low-skilled, low-waged country or took the high road to high skills and high wages. That was the road that was taken. That is the road that we must continue to travel - to high skills and high wages. That is why the Labor government is investing so heavily in skills. That is why the Labor government is investing so heavily in hundreds of thousands of productivity places. That is why the Labor government is investing in trade training centres. I lamentably have to point out that the coalition is absolutely opposed to those trades training centres.This is the road to high skills and high wages. It also requires that we dismantle, here in Australia, those impediments to opening up the economy further. We are doing that through the seamless national economy reforms. I point out that the Attorney-General, even this morning, introduced legislation for one of the 27 areas of regulatory reform - namely, personal property securities - and the Assistant Treasurer did so with trustee corporations.That is the Labor way: investing in skills and a high-skill, high-wage economy for a better future for working Australians.</DOC>

I just point out a few facts to him, including the number of employers who are actually signing up to be part of the government's historic Paid Parental Leave scheme. These are employers who actually want to keep connection with their employees. They are employers who actually understand -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just remind the opposition that in fact employers are not taking any notice of their silly political games; they are signing up and joining with the government to make sure that we continue to introduce a successful paid parental leave scheme in Australia.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Yesterday the civilised world condemned developments in Libya. Today we face the question of what to do about developments in Libya. Colonel Gaddafi has made clear his intentions. His words are chilling: he has threatened to purge Libya - 'house by house, inch by inch' - of the protest movement. He has threatened slaughter and punishment by death. He has called on the Libyan public to 'capture the rats' of the protest movement. These are the words not of a responsible political leader; these are the words of a dictator out of control.Yesterday, the Australian government together with governments around the world called in Libyan ambassadors, at least those who have not defected so far, to register international political condemnation of these statements and the actions of the Libyan regime.Yesterday I also instructed Australia's permanent representative to the United Nations to write to the UNSC president calling on the council to convene and also to consider the powers available to the council to protect the civilian population of Libya.I am advised that the United Nations Security Council has now issued a statement which contains the following provisions: that the council condemns the violence and the use of force against civilians; that the council deplores the repression against peaceful demonstrators; and that members of the council call on the government of Libya to meet its responsibility to protect its population.I am advised that this is one of the first times the United Nations Security Council has invoked the doctrine of the 'responsibility to protect' in one of its statements. This doctrine was introduced in the international community in the post Rwanda world.The Australian government welcomes the statement in the last 24 hours by the Arab League, under Secretary General Moussa, which, following its emergency session on Libya, made a decision to suspend Libya from the meetings of the Arab League. We believe this important statement by the Arab League stiffened the resolve of the United Nations Security Council against some of the resistance which may be encountered in the council on this most important responsibility to protect the civilian population of Libya.Depending on developments now in Libya, there are further steps available to the United Nations Security Council. We are following these developments in the council most closely.The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has a critical role now to play in responding to human rights abuses in Libya. It is obscene that Libya has been chair of that council in the past. It continues to be obscene that Libya remains a member of that council.It is critical that the Human Rights Council in Geneva use the opportunity to present an immediate factual report on human rights abuses in Benghazi, Tripoli and elsewhere in the country.It is time for the international community to remind the Libyan regime and its leaders that crimes against humanity fall under the Rome statute in the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. As a result, members of the regime could be held accountable for mass casualties which occur as a result of the actions of the regime. Libya of course is not a member of the ICC; it would therefore be a matter for the members of the UNSC to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court for its consideration. Other measures possibly include targeted sanctions; the imposition of a no-fly zone, which would prevent Libyan aircraft from attacking civilian targets as they have reportedly done; and the declaration of an arms embargo.The government remains seized of developments in Libya. It is difficult and dangerous, and we continue to attend to our consular responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because what the Leader of the Opposition may have noticed following the last election is that the Australian people have voted for change, they voted for a carbon price, and this parliament gives us the opportunity to price carbon and to deal with the issues that Australia needs to for the future. - Let me explain this to the Leader of the Opposition, bluntly, without the Leader of the Opposition's characteristic spins and slogans - the characteristic use of words that we associate with the Leader of the Opposition, where he seeks to destroy and wreck and spin and mislead. Let's be really clear about what we need to achieve here. Climate change is real - I believe that. I believe that it is caused by human activity. We need to act on climate change and build a low-pollution economy for the future. We need to do that because other parts of the world are acting. It is not in our interest to be left behind. We are a confident people. We are a people who have achieved change before and we will achieve it again. In achieving that change, we will make sure that we act fairly and have a fair carbon price.The carbon pricing mechanism that I have announced today, arising from the discussions of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, is a carbon price mechanism that would start on 1 July 2012. It is a scheme that would start with a fixed price for a fixed period, effectively like a tax. It would move to a cap and trade emissions trading scheme, following that fixed-price period of three to five years. The carbon price would exclude agriculture, though we would have our farmers able to participate in initiatives like our carbon farming initiative. We will design a carbon price that meets these requirements. In doing so, because we are a Labor government, we will make sure that we act fairly towards Australians and that they are treated fairly as they adjust to carbon pricing.Now is the right time to act - the right time to modernise our economy into a low-pollution, clean energy economy of the future. What Australians expect from the people that they send to this place is that they will work together for positive change. I actually believe the vast majority of people in this parliament came to this place wanting to be associated with changes that are positive for Australia and will make a difference to our future prosperity and future opportunity. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition came to this place hoping to make his name on what he can wreck, stop and destroy. We will continue working through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to price carbon. It is the right thing to do by Australian prosperity, by Australian jobs and by a clean energy future. By doing the right thing on climate change, we will keep working to price climate change and treat Australians fairly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The member for Corangamite was actually born in Christchurch and lived there until 1988 - something I did not know until talking to him about Christchurch and the earthquake in New Zealand. He has a younger brother and a grandfather there, and I am very pleased that yesterday he got the news that they were safe and well.But, as members of the parliament would know, that news has not been brought to a lot of people. Rescue and recovery efforts are still underway in Christchurch and in the surrounding districts. We have seen on our TV screens the pictures showing this grim and difficult work. I want to pay tribute to the courage and the professionalism of the many individuals who are going about doing this grim and difficult work - the search and rescue teams, the police, the fire authorities, the ambulance workers and the volunteers and ordinary citizens who are there pitching in and doing everything they can in what remains the very urgent task of looking for people amongst the rubble. The death toll now stands at more than 70, and many more are missing. That obviously is bearing down very strongly upon their families as they wait for news. We know that the likelihood of survivors being found diminishes over time. Prime Minister Key has stressed that this continues to be a rescue mission, and I am sure everybody wishes that we continue to find people alive and able to be rescued in that rubble.I have been in contact with Prime Minister Key today and he thanked me and thanked Australia for our efforts to assist New Zealand to date. We are working side by side with New Zealanders in this rescue effort. The overall number of people in the Australian effort will shortly reach 500. We have a medical assistance team, search and rescue teams and Emergency Management Australia personnel there. We have had our Defence Force involved with its aircraft and a medical field hospital. And 300 of our police officers will depart soon for New Zealand.It is something of a miracle that so far we have only seen this impact upon one long-term Australian resident - tragic, tragic news for that family. Given the scenes of devastation and destruction and the number of Australians we know were in the area, we are relieved that at this stage we have not seen that toll rise. But it does remain possible that that toll will rise as the work continues with search and rescue and as the work continues going through the rubble.Appeal funds have been set up to help the people of Christchurch. I know Australians are going to be very generous in their support. In that regard, I warmly welcomed the news today from Cricket Australia that tomorrow's Australia and New Zealand World Cup match will be broadcast live by Channel 9, Fox Sports and ABC Grandstand. Players from both teams will be showing their respect by wearing black armbands and having a moment's silence before the match. The earthquake appeal will be promoted and there will be ways for cricket lovers to donate as they watch that match.Inevitably there will be some very, very difficult days ahead as the search and rescue continues in Christchurch, and our thoughts are with the people of New Zealand as this happens.</DOC>

 - This is an attempt to mislead and to engage in a fear campaign. What the shadow Treasurer knows is that today the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee announced a carbon-pricing mechanism -  -  - The shadow Treasurer knows we did not announce a carbon price today -  -  - The member for Flinders - there's a man of conviction, Mr Speaker. - What the shadow Treasurer well knows is that we announced a mechanism today; we did not announce a dollar price today. Any attempt by the shadow Treasurer to make assumptions about figures is an attempt to cause fear, an attempt to mislead. Every Australian should recognise the opposition for what it is: an opposition with no policies or plans to make a real difference to climate change.Let me say this to the shadow Treasurer: I understand pricing carbon will have price impacts and I want to be very upfront about that with the Australian people. Indeed, the reason you price carbon is to have price impacts, so that high-pollution commodities cost more and low-pollution commodities cost less. Then the market will adjust, people will innovate and there will be change to a clean energy future with more low-pollution solutions for our Australian economy and for the people of Australia. There will be price impacts. Because we are a Labor government, because we believe in fairness, we will ensure that this carbon price mechanism works fairly -  - Every dollar that is raised by pricing carbon will go to assist Australian households and businesses make the adjustment and go to funding programs that tackle climate change. But, if we are going to talk about impacts on Australian households, then let's see some political honesty from the opposition for the first time. The opposition came into this parliament today and they voted against a $1.8 billion flood levy, saying that they did not think that the Australian people could afford to pay that. What they did not tell you today is that they stand for $10.5 billion of expenditure on climate change programs that will not work. That is $10.5 billion that the Leader of the Opposition, if he were Prime Minister, would be ripping out of the purses and wallets of hardworking Australian taxpayers. - Over on that side they stand for $10.5 billion of expenditure which would be ineffective; pollution would continue to rise and there would be no compensation. On this side of the parliament we stand for the most effective mechanism to price carbon which will transform our economy at the lowest cost. It will start on 1 July 2012, compensating Australian households so that the carbon price works fairly.The member for Mackellar then left the chamber. - We will be working to deliver a price on carbon. We know those opposite have no courage, no convictions and no plans for the future, except to rip $10.5 billion off Australians to pay for their ineffective programs. We will leave them mired in their divisions as we get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for La Trobe for her question. In answer to her question and to the members of the parliament assembled today, I would say that pricing carbon and the carbon mechanism we have put forward today comes down to some very simple, very logical propositions. Proposition No. 1: climate change is real and caused by human activity. On this side of the House we believe that the scientific consensus shows that that side of the House is mired in division and the Leader of the Opposition has had every position on that question it is possible for a human being to have - in favour, against, in favour, against, confused, does not know, in favour, against.Proposition No. 2: human history tells you that when there is a wave of change it pays to be on that wave. Take the Industrial Revolution, for example. The countries that prospered absorbed the change rather than lingering behind. Take the information technology revolution. The countries and people that prospered rode that wave of change. Bill Gates did not become a wealthy man today by saying, 'I'll sit around for 15 or 20 years to see what happens next with information technology.' He rode the wave of change.Our country too, as the world moves to a lower pollution future, needs to be there moving with the rest of the world. We cannot afford to be left behind. And the world is moving. Thirty-two countries have moved, 10 US states have emissions trading schemes, and as we move and as the world moves to a lower energy future we need to price carbon. We believe on this side of the parliament that market-based mechanisms work. We do not believe that the Australian economy is a soviet command and control style economy. It is a market based economy where market based mechanisms provide the most efficient ways of changing. And so economists around the world and the government believe that a market based mechanism will transform our economy at the lowest cost, and then of course it is just axiomatic that you will drive change if you price carbon. At the moment you can emit carbon pollution for free. If you price carbon, then people will innovate and people will change. At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether or not you have got the courage to face and shape the future. Yes, it does take courage to shape and face the future. It took courage when the Hawke Labor government dealt with tariff reform in this country, and when they dealt with tariff reform what they were doing was sending a price signal to industries in this country that they would have to innovate and change.Let us look at what happened with that tariff reform. There were all sorts of fear campaigns at the time about job losses and the end of Australian industry, but as a result of that kind of reform we are prosperous and stronger today. We will send a price signal on carbon. We will hear fear campaigns from the opposition today and people should remember that those fear campaigns end up amounting to nought. We are a creative and confident people. We will get this done.</DOC>

 - This is an attempt to mislead the Australian people and we will hear more of it from the opposition -  -  - This is an attempt to mislead - shamelessly, an attempt to mislead. - They believe in the politics of fear and this is how they deal with the politics of fear. Let me answer the Leader of the National Party's question. What we have announced today - and I would ask the people on the opposite side who clearly have not read the announcement to do so - is a carbon pricing mechanism to start on 1 July 2012.What we have also made clear today is that there is further policy work to do and we will be announcing as that further policy work is done. What the Leader of the National Party well knows is that we have not announced a carbon price today and, in making up figures, he is trying mislead the Australian people. I will say this to the Leader of the National Party: perhaps he should be honest enough to say to the Australian people that what the government has put forward today -  -  The member for Forrest then left the chamber. 
 - is a system in which every dollar raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting Australian households and Australian families with managing the change, and it will go to assisting Australian businesses with managing the change and to programs for tackling climate change. What the National Party leader wants to do, following the Leader of the Opposition, is rip $10.5 billion away from Australian taxpayers without a cent of compensation. -  - What the Leader of the National Party should also be honest enough to do is consult with the member for Groom who said very clearly before the last election that when you look at circumstances in the electricity industry, under any scenario electricity prices are going up. That is what the member for Groom said. With the government's carbon pricing system we will be in a position to assist Australian families and to compensate them as the carbon price comes into effect. What the Leader of the National Party is proposing to do is to offer no compensation but $10.5 billion of tax for programs that are ineffective. Maybe the Leader of the National Party does not understand, but when you make a promise to spend $10.5 billion on programs that money has to come from somewhere and it would come from Australian taxpayers. -  - So it is about time that the opposition, instead of using its slogans, actually went to the Australian people and told them the truth. Climate change is real. We must price carbon in order to reduce carbon pollution. We must rely on our market mechanisms to do that efficiently. We must drive innovation and change to a clean energy economy. We must get the jobs that come with that. We must be fair to Australians on the way through. That is the future; you are the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question. I say to the member for Denison on the question of federal financial assistance that I am advised that no application has been made for funding under the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. On the question of the approval process: it is important to remind the House that that is not determined by cabinet; that is actually the obligation of the minister under the relevant piece of environmental legislation, and that legislation is, of course, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. I can also advise the House that Gunns have made public statements to indicate that if the pulp mill does secure that environmental approval from the minister, the company plans to meet conditions that are stricter than those set out in the approval; so, if they get the approval, they have publicly stated that they intend to do better.It is also important to note that the Tasmanian community is at the moment in a different position to the past. For generations everything around forestry in Tasmania has been characterised by conflict - and the member referred in his question to me that this has been a very divisive issue for the Tasmanian community. As he is aware, in an historic move several months ago the industry, union, community and environmental representatives sat down and started to work through a process to reach agreement on the future of forestry. They have produced a statement of principles. As I said in December last year, those involved have worked through a very complicated thing, a thing very much characterised by division. The fact that they have patiently done so is a credit to all of them.That statement does include a commitment to a strong, sustainable timber industry, including a pulp mill, and a commitment to the progressive implementation of a moratorium on the logging of high-conservation value forests. This is not a government agreement; it was brokered by community, union, industry and stakeholder groups. Therefore, I view our role as a supportive role to bring that agreement to fruition and into life. In that regard we have announced, working with the Tasmanian government, the appointment of Mr Bill Kelty as an independent facilitator. He has been working through as an honest broker with the various stakeholder groups and is very well received by them.On the process from here: as I understand the work involved that Mr Kelty is now facilitating, the stakeholder groups are planning to consult further to resolve outstanding issues. I understand there remains a great deal of goodwill. It is too early to say whether or not the statement of principles will form a lasting settlement of these difficult and divisive issues, but I am hopeful. I say to the member for Denison that there is cause for some cautious optimism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I would say to the member for Canberra, and I would say to the House, that we stand here today in this House of Representatives in a peaceful, prosperous, multicultural nation, a creative and confident nation because of the reforms enacted by governments of both political persuasions over the past 30 years. These reforms ensured that our nation would be prosperous for the future and that it would be a nation of peace and creativity and multiculturalism.If we go through the great economic reforms of our age, of the past 30 years, that have brought us here to this point - the floating of the dollar; the reduction of tariff walls; the embracing of free trade and an open, competitive economy; banking competition to ensure that we had competitive, stable banks; the goods and services tax, a major reform to the taxation system in this nation - these major reforms of the past have enabled us to have a prosperous economy that has survived the GFC, the global financial crisis, and it today can offer Australians the benefit of jobs. There are so many nations around the world where people lack the benefits and dignity of work, but in this country people can have the benefit of jobs.And because of the courageous decisions of the governments' past, we live in a multicultural society and we proudly have a non-discriminatory immigration program. It has not always been easy. It was not easy in the days of the One Nation challenge to the non-discriminatory immigration program. It was not easy, but both sides of the parliament worked together to ensure that we kept that non-discriminatory immigration program.We entered this week in federal politics having had a divisive and ugly debate about multiculturalism. The Leader of the Opposition faced a test of his leadership, a test to endorse a non-discriminatory immigration policy, a test that required him to get rid of his shadow immigration minister and a shadow parliamentary secretary. He has failed that test. We have ended this week with the Leader of the Opposition moving a motion he knew could not be carried in an act of absurdity to try to start a new fear campaign.This is the year of decision and delivery. We will bring our reforming heritage, our Labor values of reform from the past, to the task of pricing carbon, to the task of implementing health reform, to the task of increasing opportunity for Australians through a better education system, to the task of ensuring Australians have the benefits and dignity of work and to the task of building the National Broadband Network to make sure we have the jobs of the future. And there the Leader of the Opposition stands, clutching his increasingly hollow three-word slogans: a man with no ideas, no policies, no plans for the nation's future; a man who is skilled in the ability to wreck, but who lacks the ability to create. He has no idea how to drive the change that this nation needs. There are some members on his backbench who remember the proud reforming tradition of the Liberal Party. We will wait to see those members come to the fore over the coming weeks because they do not want to be associated with the politics of the Leader of the Opposition. And with those words, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I presume when the Leader of the Opposition was having this discussion that he was also talking about whether or not that small business person wanted to see a strong economy and that he was also talking about whether or not that small business person wanted to see us have the clean energy jobs of the future. I hope he was also talking to that small business person about the way in which the Leader of the Opposition, in the last few days, has gone around trying to mislead Australians about this important debate in pursuit of a fear campaign, because the only thing the Leader of the Opposition ever came to this parliament to do was to stop things, wreck things and destroy things.As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, what the government has announced is a mechanism to price carbon. What the Leader of the Opposition well knows is that a carbon price has not been announced yet; nor has the household assistance package. Yet despite that, the Leader of the Opposition and members of the shadow cabinet are wandering around trying to create fear amongst Australians about what impact this will have on them. Every day they go around with different figures. The shadow minister earlier said $1,100 - he just made a figure up. The New South Wales opposition leader is wandering around with $500 - he just made a figure up. The Leader of the Opposition is wandering around with figures like $300 and 6½c. All of these figures have been made up by the Leader of the Opposition in pursuit of his fear campaign.But what the Leader of the Opposition has never done and what he will never do is become honest with the Australian people and say to them that he himself has personally endorsed a carbon tax as the simplest way of pricing carbon and that he himself has said that every decision he has ever made about this has not been about the policy or what is in Australia's national interest, but about the politics - pure and simple. The only judgment he has ever made about this has been as a weathervane, holding his finger up to see how he could politically profit from this rather than have the nation profit from it.The Leader of the Opposition should also come clean with the Australian people and explain to them that he wants to saddle on their shoulders $10.5 billion of ineffective measures, ripping money out of their purses and wallets to use in pursuit of his ineffective direct action measures. That is what the Leader of the Opposition should be honest about. Let's have this debate. Let's have it loud and clear, in this parliament and beyond. We stand for action; you stand for inaction. We stand for giving businesses certainty; you stand for uncertainty. We stand for generously assisting households; you stand for rising power prices with no assistance. We stand for making sure we make a difference to our economy and create a clean energy economy for the future; you stand for no prosperity, no jobs and no prospects.</DOC>

 - I was in the electorate of the member for Wakefield today, and I was there for a very important announcement. I was there for the rolling off of the production line of the first Holden Cruze - a smaller, greener vehicle being manufactured by Holden in this country. When I had the great privilege of actually turning the key and driving that first Holden Cruze off the production line, I reflected to myself on fear campaigns past. The member for Wakefield and other members of this House would recall when the Hawke government set about modernising our economy and cutting tariffs. People were out there beating the drums of fear. They were saying, 'What this means is Australia will be a bankrupt place. Industry will suffer. There will be no jobs. We will never manufacture things in this country.' But cutting tariffs sent a price signal to Australian industry to get more efficient. Here we are, all these years later, and what has Holden done? It has got more efficient and it is a great tribute to its workforce that it has engaged in those efficiencies, a great tribute to management and a great tribute to the relevant unions, all of which have worked together to keep Holden manufacturing here - and now proudly manufacturing the new Holden Cruze.What we should learn from this is the lesson of history, that fear campaigns are just that and that fear campaigns appeal to people because they want them to be afraid of the future. But, really, we want to build a future that has a clean energy economy with jobs. We are a confident people. We have engaged in major economic reforms before, and the legacy of those major economic reforms is a more prosperous country with higher-skilled jobs - an Australia that can make its way in the world. We are up to doing that again. Carbon pollution is the challenge of our age, just the way tariffs were the challenge of the Hawke-Keating era, and we are up to meeting this challenge.That is why I am determined that we will price carbon, that we will cut carbon pollution. That will send a price signal, which means people will respond. Businesses will innovate; they will become cleaner and greener. We will have a clean energy future with all of the jobs that go with it. I can confidently say to this parliament today that, after we have priced carbon and this system has come into effect, people will look back at this fear campaign by the Leader of the Opposition and they will look at him the way the future always looks at people who miss the wave of history - people who misjudge the big calls. They will look at him as an ultimately hollow person who sought to profit from fear but ultimately did not. We will get on with creating the clean energy jobs of the future, the Australian prosperity of the future. Australians are too smart, too confident, too worldly and they have been through too much in terms of major economic reform to succumb to this cheap, empty fear campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. What I would say to the Leader of the National Party is what I have said publicly on a number of occasions now, which is: decisions will be worked through by the government and in the multiparty climate change committee about sectors of the economy that the carbon price will apply to, including whether or not it will apply to petrol. Those decisions are still to come. I indicated when statements were made, and reported in the media, on Saturday by the Deputy Leader of the Greens that it was inappropriate to be making those statements when those decisions and discussions were yet to come. But, given that the Leader of the National Party has raised with me statements made by people about carbon pricing, I have actually got a few of them he might be interested in. The Leader of the Opposition said:If you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax? -  - Yes, we know you are embarrassed -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and thank you for that clarification. Of course, the words of the Leader of the Opposition are always strictly irrelevant to national debates; I do understand and accept your guidance on that. -  - The Leader of the National Party raises with me decisions that are yet to come on questions like carbon pricing and petrol. I can assure the Leader of the National Party that, as we go about making these decisions, we will do it in Australia's national interest. I can also assure the Leader of the National Party that that approach will be in stark contrast to the approach ever taken by the opposition, because whether you make decisions in the national interest or in the political interest has been clarified by the Leader of the Opposition. He said about climate change:I don't think my assessment of the science or of the policies ever changed that much. I think all that really changed was my assessment of the politics of the issue.Hollow to the core.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned, living as she does in a very beautiful part of the world, about carbon pollution and she is also very concerned about economic prospects for the future.We live in a country that has abundant sources of renewable energy: solar, wind, geothermal, tidal - abundant sources of renewable energy. As a country, we therefore can profit by having a clean energy future, by innovating and by having the jobs of the future. It is not in the interests of our nation to be left behind as the world changes. We need to cut carbon pollution. Despite the Leader of the Opposition's ability to wreck and destroy things, one thing he has not wrecked as yet is a bipartisan commitment to a minus five per cent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020. In order to reach that reduction in carbon pollution, we need to price carbon. To do anything else would be costly and inefficient. I refer of course to the words that were written in the incoming government briefs, and the Leader of the Opposition received this and would have seen their words: 'Direct action measures alone cannot do the job' - that is, of cutting carbon pollution by minus five per cent - 'without imposing significant economic and budget costs.'Indeed, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has estimated that even with the Leader of the Opposition's direct actions measures emissions will rise 17 per cent above 2000 levels, whereas the target is minus five. What does that mean for the difference? That means the Leader of the Opposition's plan to deal with climate change is to buy $20 billion in carbon credits to meet the gap between where his direct action measures take you to and the minus five per cent target. That is in addition to the $10.5 billion he has pledged in direct action measures and, of course, it is in addition to his $11 billion black hole from his reckless election accounting.When you add all of that up it means the Leader of the Opposition's strategy for climate change is to make households worse off by around $600 a year. There is no such thing as a no-cost approach, and what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is make households worse off by $600 a year.On this side of the parliament we stand for pricing carbon in the most efficient way. If you are pricing carbon in the most efficient way then you are putting a price on carbon through a market mechanism, through trading permits to release carbon pollution. That is what the government went to the last election saying to the Australian people we should do and that is exactly what we are going to do.Today before question time the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed that he now holds the most reckless political position taken by a national leader in the last 15 years. After we have priced carbon, given businesses certainty and households assistance, he is committed to ripping all of that up - the most reckless political position taken by a national leader in 15 years. We will be holding him to account for that every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year, and Australians will see exactly how wrong and reckless he is.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It enables me to say that the Liberal Party are the party of the past - mired in it as they are - whilst we talk about the future. It is not surprising they gave this question to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because, whenever I have a casual word with one of her backbench colleagues, they say she is history. So it is no surprise that they have given her the question that is about history because they all know she is history.I have always believed that climate change is real, that it is caused by human induced activity, that in order to cut carbon pollution we need to price carbon and that the most efficient way of doing that is through a market based mechanism - and through the carbon pricing mechanism I announced last week we will do precisely that. During the time I have had those beliefs day after day, hour after hour, week after week, month after month, there has been the Leader of the Opposition. He accepts the science? No. It is 'absolute crap'. He believes in pricing carbon? No, he does not believe in pricing carbon. Yes, he believes in pricing carbon? No, he does not believe in pricing carbon. The only thing the Leader of the Opposition has ever stood for in this debate is what he believes to be the political interests of the Liberal Party. That is not good enough for someone who contends to be Prime Minister in this country. That is not good enough for someone with the responsibility of national leadership on their shoulders.What Australians send us here to do is to take charge of the issues that are most important to this country's future. I am doing that job. The government is doing that job. The Leader of the Opposition is incapable of doing it and he shows it day after day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. I am glad I can get a question from the other side somewhere! Indeed last Wednesday there was another heavy downpour in the region of the honourable member, some 500 kilometres east of Kalgoorlie, resulting in the main east-west line being cut. I am advised that the flooding occurred over an 80-kilometre section of track, with 12 separate locations becoming impassable, some under more than a metre of water. This caused damage to the track, but I am pleased to advise that today I have spoken to John Fullerton, the head of the Australian Rail Track Corporation, and they have acted swiftly and reconstruction work has already commenced.On Saturday the material to rebuild the track arrived on location by special trains. Customers have been advised of the suspension of services and they are being briefed on a 12-hourly basis on the progress of the track recovery. I am advised that the ARTC is aiming to reopen the track late on Wednesday afternoon. ARTC has plans in place to restart services and clear the backlog of trains which has built up on the network and it is hopeful that by the end of next week operations will have returned to normal.Of course the member would be aware that the government committed over $120 million of investment to upgrade the track through rerailing and also installing passing loops around the Kalgoorlie area. That has made a big difference. Travel time between Sydney and Perth has been cut by almost an hour already. By the end of the process we will have rebuilt more than a third of the national network, reducing travel times, increasing productivity but also - and very importantly given today's debate - as part of the whole-of-government response to dealing with climate change, getting trucks off the road and getting freight onto rail. That is more productive, good for the economy and also good for the environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Climate scientists -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Climate scientists are telling governments all over the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The scientific consensus is overwhelming and the government respects the climate science. A government in that circumstance has a public policy responsibility to act upon that advice in everyone's interests and we simply need to make a start in reducing carbon pollution in our economy. As the highest per capita emitter of carbon pollution amongst the developed countries, and being a nation that is especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change, we must tackle this issue. - It is a public policy responsibility. The alternative would be to ignore the national interest, to ignore the science and to act solely in one's political interest. Of course, that is exactly what we see from the other side of politics. And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition -  - has notoriously described the science as 'absolute crap'. Indeed, Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has argued that the science has been fabricated. Of course, Senator Minchin famously blamed it on the communists! But the Leader of the Opposition has come up with my favourite. He said the following back in November 2009:If you look at Roman times, grapes grew up against Hadrian's Wall - medieval times they grew crops in Greenland. In the 1700s they had ice fairs on the Thames.That was the Leader of the Opposition. Given that he was not around -  - in those days, one would -  - wonder what the authority is for that particular statement. It does not take long to find a very similar remark, and I will name the source in a minute:There have been times when it is a lot warmer than now, when Greenland was ice free and you could grow melons in the open in England _ and even in the 1600s when the Thames River in London froze over.Where is it from? It is from the One Nation party climate change policy. The One Nation party seem very influential in the policies of the opposition. What a disgrace. You call that accepting public policy responsibility? It does not take much more googling to find out where the concept of the 'people's revolt' comes from either: it is the Tea Party, the far right of US politics. No ideas, nothing to say, nothing to contribute on one of the most critical policy issues that we face. On reflection, the stand-off that we witnessed between the Leader of the Opposition and Channel 7 journalist Mark Riley provided us with an important insight into what is going on here. He is all menace, all aggression, with nothing to say, no ideas - it is 'no, no, no' - nothing to contribute.</DOC>

 - I really do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. There is a very basic reason why I take the position that I take and the government takes the position it takes: it is in the national interest. It is in the interests of a prosperous economy. What those opposite are doing is putting their political interests, through a scare campaign, ahead of the need to reduce carbon pollution and make our economy more prosperous for the future. The populism of those opposite is evident in the question from the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer used to believe, once upon a time, in markets. The shadow Treasurer, I know, goes around the place saying he is a great man of principle. In fact, he made this statement about what a great man of principle he was shortly after he was defeated in the Liberal Party leadership contest: 'I believe in a market mechanism' -  - Like the shadow Treasurer says he is, I am a believer in a market mechanism. What we are going to do is move through a fixed price to a market mechanism, and that was made very clear the other day. But, when the shadow Treasurer was defeated in the leadership contest, he made this point, because he said then that he was a believer in a market mechanism:I'm a believer. I want action for not only this generation but for my children, grandchildren.So he, like the Leader of the Opposition, is a hollow man. He says he believes in a market mechanism and opposes it in this House. He says he is a believer in the science of climate change -  - and opposes it in this House. The government have moved, in the national interest, to make sure that we can protect jobs, direct investment into renewable energy and protect the prosperity of our economy, and every step of the way we are opposed by those opposite, who would rather see the country fail than see us succeed in battling climate change and investing in renewable energy. It just shows that all of those opposite would say anything and do anything to win a political action, but they will not stand up for the political interests of this country. They are only looking after their own.</DOC>

 - A market mechanism is the best mechanism because it produces the least cost, most efficient reduction in carbon pollution. So we on this side of the House think markets have an essential role in dealing with market failure when it comes to carbon pollution. Now, Mr Stern, the most pre-eminent economist in this area, has made the observation that this is the greatest market failure in history - the failure to price carbon pollution. The failure to price carbon pollution means that carbon pollution continues to be emitted, with devastating consequences for the planet, for the global economy and of course for this country. Those opposite do not believe in climate change anymore, so perhaps they are not concerned with that market failure, but we do know that a number of those opposite do believe there has been a market failure, that it does require a price mechanism. The member for Wentworth believes that. The shadow Treasurer used to believe that, once upon a time. But we on this side of the House understand how important market mechanisms are in dealing with substantial economic problems.Of course, the Prime Minister spoke before about tariff reform - utilising changes in the price of goods, changes in the market - to bring about greater prosperity. But, of course, those opposite do not favour market mechanisms anymore. They want central government direction. They want regulation. This would not be odd if they were not the Liberal Party of Australia, on whose basis it was form to say that they believed in the market. But they no longer believe in the market. This is a very big challenge for their economic credibility. It was not that long ago that the former Prime Minister Mr Howard believed in the market. This is what he had to say:It is fundamental to any response both here and elsewhere that a price is set for carbon emissions. This is best done through the market mechanism of an emissions trading system.It was a belief held by all of those towards the end of their period in government but now repudiated by those opposite. It is a belief which is held by many other countries in the world that are moving to put in place emissions trading systems. But, of course, now we have this incredible spectacle where those on the other side of the House, who professed to believe in markets, now believe in the heavy hand of regulation against free markets. Is that where the Liberal Party of Australia now believes they are - regulation over markets? We on this side of the House believe in markets. They believe in having a bureaucrat -  - in every boardroom to deal with this question. They believe in saddling the budget with billions of dollars worth of expenditure. We on this side of the House believe in a market mechanism to deliver the best value, the most efficient outcome, so that we can get the investment in renewable energy to make our country prosperous.</DOC>

 - I very much welcome the Leader of the Opposition's question. To the Leader of the Opposition, I say this: if he wants to have a debate about political honesty, bring it on. This is the man that on the 7.30 Report basically said, when he was struggling under questioning from Kerry O'Brien, 'If I say it, don't believe it because it's only anywhere near the gospel truth if I write it down.' They were the words out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the man that went to an election giving a rock solid, ironclad guarantee and then broke his word immediately afterwards. This is a man who is on the public record as saying from time to time he gilds the lily. This is a man who created some of the most spectacular election footage ever shown on Australian TV when interviewed on Lateline and asked about his visits to Cardinal Pell. We all remember what happened. It looked a little bit like he looked with Mark Riley the other week - deadset looked down the camera at Tony Jones and told an untruth and then caught in that untruth looked filthy and aggressive the way we know the Leader of the Opposition can when he is at his most hollow. The member for Sturt then left the chamber.  - If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate on political honesty, well, bring it on. I am happy to debate that any day of the week. The Leader of the Opposition's track record on these questions is absolutely clear. He has gone to election campaigns and not been truthful with the Australian people. He has tried to defend on TV his lack of truthfulness with moving excuses and with odd excuses. The member for Cowan then left the chamber. 
 - His lack of truthfulness has come to an absolute head on the question of climate change. The Leader of the Opposition has had every position on climate change it is possible for a human being to have. Climate change science - do you accept it or not accept it? The Leader of the Opposition has said and believed both. One day he accepts it; one day he does not. Do you price carbon or not price carbon? The Leader of the Opposition has said on different days different things about that. Some days he wants to price carbon; other days he wants to not price carbon. Do you want a carbon tax? The Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he wants a carbon tax. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked a very broad question on political honesty and I am answering it. On the question of pricing carbon and climate change, are you for it or against it? The Leader of the Opposition has had both positions: yes, he accepts the science; no, he does not. Should you price carbon? The Leader of the Opposition has had both positions: yes, you should; no, you should not. Should you support a carbon tax? Let me quote the words of the Leader of the Opposition - his words, not mine -  - He said:I also think that if you want a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax?And he goes on:It would be burdensome, but it would certainly change the price of carbon - He went on:Why not ask motorists to pay more? Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more? - Mr Speaker, what is vital about this carbon price debate is that people come to this place and put a position in our national interest. That is what I am focused on, that is what the government is focused on, and all we see from the Leader of the Opposition is his track record of untruthfulness and political opportunism on display.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, even in the words of his question he is continuing his campaign of misleading and generating fear amongst the Australian community. If the Leader of the Opposition today hung out at a fruit and vegetable shop and said to the owners of that shop the words he said to the parliament today, he has done them a great disservice. He has told them an untruth; he has told them something he knew not to be true at the time he said it, and he did it for no other purpose than to further his fear campaign and his political interests. It is not right to go around saying things that are untrue in order to generate fear in the Australian community, and that is what the Leader of the Opposition is doing.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: we on this side stand for giving businesses, like the one that he went to today, certainty so that they know, as they make the arrangements for their business, what arrangements actually apply so that they can do their business plans with certainty. It seems to me a little interesting that at one point the Leader of the Opposition actually thought certainty was important for businesses. At one point, on 19 July, he was wandering around saying things like, 'I think businesses deserve certainty,' and, 'I think what business needs is a period of certainty and stability.' The shadow Treasurer said on 21 July:We now accept the Australian people want certainty and stability out of Canberra.Now, of course, what is the Leader of the Opposition promising Australian businesses? He said it on morning TV today. He was asked:Big business is obviously a little concerned, a little confused. Where does it leave them in all of this?The Leader of the Opposition said:Well, completely up in the air and with no certainty.With those words the Leader of the Opposition has named his own campaign - create fear and try to stop a confident nation dealing with the challenges of the future. If his fear campaign fails and we price carbon on 1 July 2012, as I intend to do, then he will go to the next election with a plan to wreck the Australian economy with economic vandalism, a plan to rip away from businesses the certainty that they need, a plan to trash this nation's reputation in international markets, a plan to render void important investment decisions that Australian businesses have made, a plan to see electricity prices rise and rise because there is no certainty in investment in electricity, a plan to rip out of the hands of households the assistance we have given them, a plan to make sure that hardworking Australians have less money in their purses and their wallets than they have had before, and a plan to destroy Australia -  -  - The answer to the question is: the figure is a product of a campaign that is designed to mislead and scare Australians. The political party in this parliament that stands for increasing power prices is the Liberal Party, with its plan for chaos and uncertainty. We will get on with the job of pricing carbon and assisting households on the way through.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. She, as all members of the government and other people of goodwill in this place are, is interested in the future of this country and making sure that we have a clean energy economy for the future. -  - I expect the opposition to interject because, of course, they are a party of the past. Let me explain in detail our mechanism for pricing carbon. The first proposition is an incredibly simple one. At the moment carbon pollution can be released into the atmosphere for free. There is no disincentive for doing that. We will put a price on carbon, a price on every unit of carbon pollution. It will be paid for by businesses and as a result, because our business community is smart and adaptable and innovative, they will work out ways of pursuing their business and generating less carbon pollution. They will work out ways of making sure they pay less of a price when carbon is priced. Then they will enter into contracts, they will make investments on the basis of understanding the rules and understanding that carbon will be priced. And as they go about making those transitions, innovating, making the new investments of the future, we will work with those businesses in transition to a clean economy.Having priced carbon and seen that innovation, yes, there will be pricing impacts; that is absolutely right. That is the whole point: to make goods that are generated with more carbon pollution relatively more expensive than goods that are generated with less carbon pollution. But because we are a Labor government this will be done in a fair way. We will assist households as we transition with this new carbon price. What that means is that people will walk into a shop with money in their pocket, the government having provided them with assistance. They will see the price signals on the shelves in front of them - things with less pollution, less expensive; things with more pollution, more expensive - and they too will adapt and change. They will choose the lower pollution products, which is exactly what we want them to do. Between the business investment and innovation, between households who have been assisted in a fair way by a Labor government responding to price signals, we will see a transition to a cleaner economy, to a clean energy economy, to a low-pollution economy.What does that mean? Put very simply, it means jobs. It means that our economy will keep pace with a transition that is happening around the world. Our economy will keep pace and we will have the jobs of the future. What is the alternative? The alternative is to keep emitting carbon pollution. It is to see Australia left behind the tide of history with a high-pollution economy. It is exporting jobs to the rest of the world - jobs that Australian kids could have to build a future on. It is leaving households to deal with escalating electricity prices, which are going up because of a lack of investment certainty, and without household assistance in their pockets. And, of course, if we follow the Leader of the Opposition's plan, it is also about ripping $30 billion off taxpayers. The efficient way to transform our economy is to price carbon and that is what we will do.</DOC>

 - Once again the Leader of the Opposition forgets what he said yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this parliament every day and, because he is a hollow person of no consistent beliefs, he believes that he can come into this parliament and say something today and not be held to account for what he said yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect that in the period of the parliament between 2007 and 2010, when the Leader of the Opposition was adopting different climate change position after different climate change position, when the member for Wentworth was writing of his embarrassment at the political hollowness and weathervane politics of the Leader of the Opposition, in all of those twists and turns of inconsistent statements, the Leader of the Opposition said that he accepted the government had a mandate to price carbon.We went to the 2007 election campaign saying we would price carbon. Here is some news for the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to think that everybody has forgotten yesterday: so did Prime Minister John Howard go to the 2007 election promising to price carbon. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am a bit surprised that the member for Flinders would come to the dispatch box. He has caused me to ponder whether, if you walk away from your honours thesis, you get your honours degree stripped off you? I think someone needs to answer that question for us, because his honours thesis makes very good reading. I happen to have extracts of it here. He said:_ the market is the preferable regime as it better ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct.Good words. He wrote:Businesses' greatest concern, according to the Liberal Party, is the need to have a certainty which would enable them to plan for the long term.I could not have written it better myself. I am glad he got first-class honours. I am a bit ashamed he is walking away from it now. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the Leader of the Opposition well knows that the Labor Party went to the 2007 election saying we would price carbon with an emissions trading scheme. -  - Prime Minister Howard went to the 2007 election saying he would price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. I went to the 2010 election saying I would price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. We, at the 2010 election, said to the Australian people: we believe climate change is real, we believe it is a caused by human activity, we believe in order to tackle climate change you need to price carbon and we believe the most efficient mechanism for doing that is an emissions trading scheme. What I announced last week will be an emissions trading scheme, a market based mechanism, a permanent system, with a fixed price for the first three to five years. The Leader of the Opposition raises with me community consensus and community debate. Let me assure the Leader of the Opposition -  - we will be out there in every community across the country advocating the need to price carbon and exposing his hollow, phoney, sham fear campaign for exactly what it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Of course, she understands the need for certainty, having been a small business person herself and because she is in touch with her local business community. I think it will amaze people who are watching this parliament today that the Liberal Party, of all political parties, think that business certainty is something to laugh about. They would prefer economic chaos, in their modern incarnation under this Leader of the Opposition. In pricing carbon we will be providing businesses with certainty. We need to convert our economy to a clean energy economy for the future. By world standards, we are very big emitters of carbon pollution - the biggest emitters per capita in the developed world, with 27 tonnes of carbon pollution per person. That is more than the United States and it is significantly more than the per capita emissions of places like China and India.What we need to do is price carbon to give business certainty. Let me refer to the words of Brad Page, of the Energy Supply Association, who knows about the need for investment in energy generation. People who are genuinely concerned about rising energy costs for Australian families should listen to these words:Uncertain greenhouse gas emission policy adversely impacts on new energy supply decisions _An equitable and enduring greenhouse gas emissions price signal is required to promote investor confidence, deliver greenhouse gas abatement and reward the uptake of new low-emission technologies.Industry is crying out for certainty - crying out for certainty. I look over at the member for Groom because he is a man who, in the past, has talked about the need for business certainty. He said it in the following words - these are the words of the member for Groom:What I hear from small business is that they want certainty. They want to know where they are going to be in 12 months time.He also said that they said to him, and this was about the GST:What we don't want is roll-back. We do not want roll-back. It will complicate our business. It will mean wholesale changes. It will mean wave after wave of reform.Never a truer word was spoken about the consequences for businesses if they fear a loss of certainty, if they do not know what is going to happen next. The Leader of the Opposition himself once supported business certainty. In July last year, he said business 'deserves certainty'. Again in July last year, he said:_ I think what business needs is a period of certainty and stability.But today he was on morning television, proudly saying in answer to a question about business certainty:Well, completely up in the air and with no certainty.That is his vision of the Australian economy.Let us be very clear about what this loss of business sense of certainty will mean. It will trash Australia's reputation around the world as a safe place to invest. It will strand investments that people have made on the basis of a carbon price. It will cost jobs. It will rip out of the hands of householders money supplied to them that they are relying on to meet the costs of living. It will leave Australia a poorer place. The right strategy is to ensure we have the clean energy jobs of the future. We will do that by pricing carbon, despite the fear campaign, despite the campaign of uncertainty.

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me how money raised from carbon pricing will be used. I refer her to what I said at the press conference last Thursday. When I announced the carbon pricing mechanism I said:Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, helping businesses manage the transition and funding climate change programs. And the government will always support those who are in need of assistance with cost of living pressures.That is where the money will go. When I was on the Today show on Sunday I said:_ I do want to be clear. Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, to helping businesses transition, and to programs to tackle climate change. But the highest priority will be assisting households. - Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more broadly, I have very little idea of what she is on about but I am not on my own there. Whenever you meet one of the Liberal backbenchers in the corridors, they are very keen to offer an assessment about not knowing what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on about - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has any real interest in assistance for Australian households than let me advise her of this: if she is really interested in assistance for Australian households, she will be supporting the government. Today, in a press conference shortly before question time, when her leader was asked about household assistance he said:It sort of defeats the purpose of making everything more expensive and it creates this giant money-go-round.Of the Leader of the Opposition's utterances today, what we do understand is that he thinks that a carbon tax is the simplest way to price carbon and he is opposed to household compensation. That is what he said today. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in household compensation, she will be endorsing the government's position.On the question of foreign aid, what I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that the government will make its own decisions. You will get yours from One Nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I hope that he, in his appearance, is setting a trend for those who work in Parliament House, including some members of the press gallery - Phil Hudson and Dennis Shanahan, amongst others - so congratulations to him. He asked me about a very important Productivity Commission inquiry which is underway - an inquiry into how this nation could better assist Australians with disabilities. The interim report of the Productivity Commission was made available yesterday and I am pleased that the interim report has got some general acceptance across the parliament as a very good piece of work.As the member would know, this is the interim report. There is now a further comment period for people who are interested. So many people around the country have a disability or are a carer or a family member or a friend of an Australian with a disability and will want to have their voices heard in this inquiry process. So there will be a further period in which people can provide their comments and then the final report will be made available in July. After the final report is made available, the government will respond to it. As the member is probably aware, the Productivity Commission does genuinely take on board feedback between the interim report and the final report and we may well find that some parts of it are changed from what has been made available now.I do endorse what the member has said. This is an incredibly important area of work. It is somewhere where the government has made a start, but there is more to do. We have doubled federal funding, providing more than $6 billion over five years to deliver more and better specialist disability services. We have improved access to specialist employment services because many Australians living with a disability do want to work, but they may need that extra bit of assistance to get into the workforce. Of course, we have delivered a historic pension increase to assist people with a disability and their carers, something that made a very big difference to them. These are Australians that live under a great deal of pressure.The government is also funding the Better Start for Children with Disability program. This is all about early intervention for children diagnosed with sight and hearing impairments, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, and it follows in the wake of the earlier successful program to assist children with autism.But, despite these investments, I acknowledge and the government acknowledges that there is more the nation needs to do to support Australians with disability. I think, with the interim report yesterday, we are off to a good start on working out major new policy improvements. I am glad to see that that has received bipartisan support at this point. I do genuinely hope that that bipartisanship lasts as we go through the next stage of the process, which will be the final Productivity Commission report in the middle of the year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. Economists and the business community understand that having a carbon price is a very important part of our economic evolution. Over 30 countries around the world have moved to a carbon price and, unless we move, we are at serious risk of being left behind. We do have to move to the low-pollution economy of the future; it is absolutely essential to future prosperity. Of course, there are even those opposite who think a move to a carbon price is inevitable. The shadow Treasurer himself said on 20 May that we have to, it is 'inevitable'. And we have had the shadow minister for climate change who has written a thesis saying it is absolutely imperative to have a price on carbon. And we have got the member for Wentworth, who has had this to say - and he only said this on 12 June 2010:_ we cannot cost effectively achieve a substantial cut in emissions without putting a price on carbon. We have to put a price on carbon.So that is the view of three senior shadow ministers across the other side of the House. But we really heard the truth of it last night when the member for Wentworth was on the BBC and he said: 'Look, it would have otherwise been different. I was only beaten by one vote.' So there are a lot more opposite who do really believe in a carbon price.It is one thing to oppose what the government is going to do on a carbon price. It is an entirely different thing to say that it would be repealed. Nothing could be more damaging to investment in this country. You could not send a more damaging message to international investors and particularly to investors in renewable energy than a promise to repeal. I think that demonstrates how desperate are all of those opposite. They are prepared to do anything to trash our economic reputation and to trash our standing in the international community. Nowhere is this more damaging than when it comes to the energy supply sector. We have seen five-year forecasts in that sector fall from $18 billion in 2009 to $8 billion in 2010. As the Prime Minister was saying before, if we do not get a carbon price in place we will not get the investment in the energy sector, and electricity prices will be higher than they otherwise would be. Responsibility for that will be directly at the feet of all those opposite.This decision not just to oppose but to repeal strikes at the heart of business certainty, strikes at the heart of investment in jobs in our economy. If anything demonstrates how irresponsible they are and how they have no economic credentials or capacity to govern, it has been this decision. What we have opposite with the Leader of the Opposition is a political con man who is not game to take a tough decision, a con man who wants to believe dealing with climate change is cost free.The member for Indi then left the chamber. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I am pleased the shadow Treasurer has asked me that question because it enables me to go back to our commitment to price carbon, which is longstanding and enduring - a lot more longstanding than the shadow Treasurer, who was only 12 months ago saying that he believed in a price on carbon. We have announced an emissions trading scheme. That puts a price on carbon. First of all we are going to have a fixed price and then we are going to have a floating price. What we have done is to take the courageous economic decision for the future of this country. Yes, there is political risk associated with that courageous decision, but we are putting the national interest ahead of our own political interest. Of course, what you have seen here from the scare campaign that has been run by the opposition leader, who is a political con man, who wants to pretend that dealing with climate change is cost free -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. - It is well-known that the Leader of the Opposition is a climate change sceptic. He is the best friend that carbon ever had. - There is a stark contrast between the government and the opposition. Labor has got its sleeves rolled up and is taking the tough decisions for the future of the country to support jobs, and what we are getting from the opposition is just negativity and scare campaigns - reaching the dizzy heights of negativity. You can just see him at the next campaign, out there saying to the Australian people: 'No, we can't! We can't deal with the challenge of climate change. We can't deal with making our country more prosperous by investing in infrastructure. We can't invest in the NBN. No, we can't.' Well, I will tell you what: the Australian people respect those who have the guts to take the tough decisions for prosperity. That is what this government is doing, and everybody knows that what is being said by the opposition is a big con job. Pretending you can deal with carbon emissions in a cost-free way is nothing other than a con job. Those opposite want to tax families and hand the money to polluters. What we want to do is charge polluters and give the money to households and industry.</DOC>

 - Putting a price on carbon in our economy is a major economic reform that is in this country's long-term interests, and it will drive cuts in pollution, it will drive investment in clean energy and it will provide a stable environment for investment in the future. The government's policy proposal, the framework that we announced, is responsive to the climate science and it also applies market principles as the lowest cost means to reduce pollution across our economy.The fact of the matter is that on the other side of this parliament, of this House, they are deeply divided. They are divided about the climate science and they are divided about the policy responses. The Leader of the Opposition, as we know, has had multiple different and contradictory positions on climate change himself. At various times he has advocated a carbon tax; he has advocated an emissions trading scheme on other occasions. Then, he has opposed both. He has been suspicious of market mechanisms. He has said he thinks the science is crap, although at other times he has supported action on the basis of an insurance principle. He has time travelled back to Roman times, as we heard yesterday. He checks into the One Nation website to have a look at things.Today he had an interesting experience at a press conference. After boasting that he had all these letters of support from authoritative figures supporting the coalition's so-called 'direct action' policy, he was interrupted by a journalist to say the following: 'Sorry to labour the point, Mr Abbott, but your office actually sent me your letters of support and all these people who have supported your scheme. I rang them and most of them didn't actually support your scheme, and those that did weren't actually scientists.' There are a few accusations about people being loose with the truth and gilding the lily - a little bit of it applies on the other side.On the other side of the House there is one member in particular who has maintained a consistent and principled position that I certainly have respect for, and that is the member for Wentworth. He said only yesterday in an interview on the BBC:In terms of the principles that I was standing for - at the time of the last debate about this issue - I think those principles are right - I maintain them today.Just in case there was any confusion about any of this, last night on Q&amp;A the member for Wentworth said a number of important things about this policy issue. He said: 'I think there should be a price on carbon', 'I would prefer to put a price on carbon via market-based mechanism' and 'I don't think there's a people's revolt so much about putting a price on carbon'. In relation to the coalition's policy on direct action he said, 'Well, I can't cite any economists that agree with it'. He also said: 'The coalition's policy of the government spending money to put a price on carbon with taxpayers' dollars is another way,' of dealing with it, but, 'There is always a risk when governments are making decisions like that that there will be, you know, fiscal waste. That is a risk.'This is the position. They are deeply divided on that side of parliament about the science. We well know the member for Tangney's point of view and those in other contributions that have been made from time to time. There are others that think it is a communist conspiracy. There are others that adhere to the science and recognise the best way of approaching this issue is through a market mechanism. They are deeply divided. The more we get into this debate the more those divisions will be evident.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for asking me the same question he asked me before and the answer is, of course, the same. We have been committed to an emissions trading system for many years. The shadow Treasurer was committed to an emissions trading system until about a year or a year and a half ago when he changed his mind, proving yet again that he has no principles whatsoever. We are committed to an emissions trading scheme. We have announced a scheme with a fixed price moving to a floating price. That is what we have done. We said all the way through the election campaign we were determined to price carbon. - I was drawing a very clear contrast with our policy and that of the now opposition. The now opposition have a plan to tax families and to hand all of that money to polluters. That is what they are proposing to do - $10 billion worth of so-called direct action initiatives, we are told, which are going to be paid for by the Australian people and handed to the polluters. We, in contrast to them, will charge polluters and provide assistance to households and industry. You could not get a clearer contrast between both those approaches. Our approach is strongly supported by many others opposite, as I was saying before. I will quote the member for Wentworth, again from 8 February 2010:Having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and there will always be a temptation for projects to be selected for their political appeal. - What we have here is a scare campaign being run by a mob of people who have not a clue about what we need to do to protect our prosperity. - We know that they were missing in action when the global recession threatened. It took Labor to have the courage to put in place a range of policies to support employment and small business. It was opposed every step of the way. That was for the good of our country -  - and so is our commitment to an emissions trading system.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition is the words of the member for Groom, who was very, very frank about the question of electricity prices before the last election and his words still ring true today. What he said was that the enormous investment needed across Australia to expand electricity supplies will double power prices during the next five to seven years, regardless of who wins government. He went on to say, 'Power prices are set to double over the next five to seven years irrespective of who is in government.' - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The member for Groom went on to say, 'Lack of planning has led to an investment drought.' What that means, and what the Leader of the Opposition ought to acknowledge, is that we are in a situation where electricity prices are rising, where there has been insufficient investment in the sector and, in part, that insufficient investment has occurred because of uncertainty about a carbon price. So for the small business person that the Leader of the Opposition refers to, there are basically two futures: one of rising electricity prices, with no action on carbon pollution, no investment certainty because there is no carbon price, and a continued lack of investment in electricity generation and distribution with all of the stresses and strains that implies for prices; or the alternative future, the future that the government would advocate for and which we announced when we announced the carbon pricing mechanism last week - a future where we fix a price for carbon, there is certainty for those who would invest that will enable investment in energy, in renewable energy, in electricity generation that will expand capacity that is important for small businesses, for big businesses and for households and, because we are a Labor government, there is fair and generous assistance to households. They are the two alternatives.On being clear about the alternatives, I think the Leader of the Opposition should acknowledge that his alternative is one where he takes $20 billion of taxpayers' money, uses it to buy international credits because it is the only way he can reach the bipartisan targets for carbon pollution reduction and then spends $10.5 billion on ineffective direct action measures, a total of $30 billion spent in all, so -  - an additional tax burden of $720 per year for Australian families. What the Leader of the Opposition stands for is imposing that additional $720 whilst electricity prices rise, whilst households go without compensation or assistance.We stand for a different future: pricing carbon, certainty of investment, fair and generous assistance to households. That is what our scheme is all about. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to put the politics aside and do something in the national interest. That is what we intend to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. She understands the benefits of tackling climate change. She understands the benefits of pricing carbon. She is someone who has worked with her local farming and agricultural industry to discuss the benefits of carbon farming and measures for agriculture to benefit from programs like our Carbon Farming Initiative, which was launched in her electorate.We have a responsibility to price carbon in the national interest. I do not want Australia to be amongst the highest carbon pollution emitters in the world. I do not want to experience an energy shock in fossil fuel prices and a fossil fuel constrained future. I do not want future generations to be saddled with the costs of our delay. I do not want our economy to be left behind. I do not want our confident nation to be let down. I do not want a debate that is ruled by fear instead of facts. That is why we need to act now and we need to have a national debate that is ruled by facts, not fear.A carbon price will make polluters pay, and that price signal will mean that businesses innovate and find lower pollution ways of doing things. It has happened before. To take an example of how pricing pollution works, let us look at the endeavours in the United States to remove the problem of acid rain. A price was put on sulfur emissions from power stations and people said, 'They'll install scrubbers to deal with the stripping of sulfur. That will be very expensive. How will everybody cope?' In truth, what happened was that they innovated, so they switched to coal with lower sulfur. They innovated and, yes, they did install those scrubbers, but because power stations were demanding the scrubbers in large numbers there was innovation and volume that brought the price down. What we should learn from this example is very clear: a price signal sends a message to business to innovate and to reduce pollution. When businesses started reducing pollution they worked out how to generate what they needed to with less pollution and they increased demand for alternative technologies and that in and of itself brought the price down.Former Prime Minister Mr Howard recognised these economic realities. He recognised that there would be transitional costs, but he recognised that there could be a new, lower pollution future when he said:Significantly reducing emissions will mean higher costs for businesses and households, there is no escaping that and anyone who pretends to do otherwise is not a serious participant in this hugely important public policy debate.On this side of the House we are serious about this enormously important public policy debate. It is why we are being frank with the Australian people about the need to price carbon. It is why we are being frank with the Australian people about price effects. It is why we are being frank with the Australian people about how this will change and transform our economy to a clean energy future. What we are not doing is trying to hide the cost, the way the Leader of the Opposition is - desperately trying to hide his $30 billion impost on Australian families and his extra tax bill of $720 a year. We will continue being frank and working this debate through with Australians. We would expect the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about the costs of his scheme too.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. To the member for Gilmore I would say this: I am concerned about the cost of living pressures being experienced by the constituents she names. I am concerned about the cost of living pressures being experienced by Australians. But I would also say to the member for Gilmore that when she is discussing cost of living pressures with these constituents or anyone else in her electorate what she needs to explain to them is the following: electricity prices are rising. That is true. In the future we will have further rises in electricity. That will happen under any scenario. If she is in any doubt about that she should discuss the matter with the member for Groom, who has been very forthright about that publicly.Under Labor's plan, what will happen for her constituents is that we will price carbon. We will give her constituents fair and generous household assistance. As a Labor government we will provide fair and generous household assistance. What would happen under the alternative plan being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition is that power prices would go up, there would be no household assistance and the Leader of the Opposition would impose on constituents, like the ones that the member for Gilmore names, an additional tax bill of $720 per year. - I understand that the opposition wants to do anything to distract from this simple truth, but the simple truth is that the plan being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition will mean an additional impost on families of $720. It is simple maths. The Leader of the Opposition is committed to reducing carbon pollution by five per cent by the year 2020. With his direct action measures it will increase by 17 per cent. He will need to buy permits for the difference from the international market. That will cost $20 billion. He is also committed to spending $10 billion on ineffective carbon pollution measures, on ineffective direct action measures. So $30 billion has to be found from somewhere, and it will be found by putting an additional impost of $720 on Australian families. So the member for Gilmore, concerned as she is about the cost of living and money in the pockets of her constituents and Australian families, may want to speak to the Leader of the Opposition about whether her constituents want to pay that extra $720 for his scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because the Australian economy grew by a solid 0.7 per cent in the December quarter and by 2.7 per cent through the year. This is further confirmation that the economic fundamentals in the Australian economy are strong despite some soft spots in the economy and, of course, recent natural disasters.Today's figures are underpinned by a very strong export performance. Exports contributed 0.7 per cent to the quarterly outcome despite wet weather in December. Inventory growth contributed to today's outcome as well reflecting a large build-up in agricultural production. We also saw strong growth in machinery and equipment investment, which increased by 4.7 per cent - the first quarterly increase since the small business and general tax break ended in 2009.If we look past the lumpiness in engineering construction, the fact remains that engineering construction is 12.4 per cent higher over the year. This confirms that there is a surge in engineering construction underway. This builds on the very strong capex figures that we have seen in recent days. There is something like $129 billion planned in capital expenditure for 2010-11 and, of course, more for 2011-12.So today's outcome is a good outcome for Australia. It should be welcomed by those opposite, but of course it is not because, as we know, they are economically illiterate and they are simply not interested in some of the basic facts about our economy. When we look -  -  - I would have thought those opposite should be interested in the national accounts. It goes to the core of our prosperity, it goes to the core of our capacity to create jobs, it goes to the core of dealing with the natural disasters that have so affected so many of our communities, it goes to our future prosperity - and I would have thought that those on that side of the House might have had some interest in these basic facts.One of the impacts of the natural disasters is that they will be felt particularly hard in the March quarter. They are going to reduce output by something like $7 billion in the March quarter. That is a challenge for our economy, but it is a challenge we are up for. It is a challenge we can deal with because of the way in which we have built strength in our economy over recent years, the way in which the government responded to the global recession, the way in which we supported small businesses, the way in which we supported employment and the way in which we supported confidence in our economy. The consequences of that are an unemployment rate of five per cent and the creation in Australia over the last year of 330,000 jobs - a job creation effort the envy of the developed world. That means there are more Australians taking pay packets home, more Australians supporting their families, more Australians living in greater security because we got the economic decisions right - the fundamental economic decisions for the future of this country.Because we are in a strong position, we can handle the savage impact of these national disasters, particularly as it will be felt in the March quarter, so we can rebuild for those people in Queensland, rebuild for those people in northern New South Wales and rebuild for those people in Victoria because we have got a responsible attitude to dealing with the fiscal challenges, to adhering to our strict fiscal discipline and to supporting our communities.

 - The shadow Treasurer has had many positions on climate change. -  - He claims to be principled. He believed in climate change and a market based approach only over a year ago. He no longer believes in it. For all of the reasons that the shadow Treasurer believed in a market approach to climate change, this government believes in a market approach to climate change. -  - What we know is that, if we are going to create the jobs of the future, if we are going to drive investment -  -  - Yes, Mr Speaker. What every single piece of economic modelling has shown about climate change, what the Stern report showed about climate change and what the Treasury modelling has shown about climate change is that the cost of inaction is far greater -  - Introducing an emissions trading scheme is all about creating the jobs of the future, all about investment in renewable energy and the jobs that come with it. It is all about jobs - because, if we do not deal with carbon emissions, we will reduce jobs in our communities. We will smash our future prosperity if we do not put in place the right price signals in our economy. So having an emissions trading scheme is all about job creation and facing up to the challenge of carbon emissions so we do not pass on to our children and our grandchildren an unsustainable debt and an unsustainable burden. This is all about jobs for the future. And where could they be? I will just quote some modelling from the Climate Institute on renewable energy: in New South Wales, up to 7,000 new power sector jobs; in Queensland, close to 6,300 new power sector jobs; in Victoria, 6,800 new power sector jobs; and so on.What we are doing here is making our economy more efficient, and we do it by charging the polluters and by assisting households and industry. We are driving investment into renewable energy and into more and better technologies. They all create the jobs of the future. But those opposite do not understand this, because when it comes to climate change the Leader of the Opposition is a flat-earther. He is a climate change sceptic -  - He has turned his back on the future. On this side of the House we understand the great challenge of the 21st century, which is to drive investment in renewable energy to prepare our industries and our people for a carbon constrained future. By driving investment in that way we create the jobs of the future. We will not, like those opposite, turn our backs on the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question. I acknowledge the significance of the biosecurity issue that he raises - and the chorus of support from some of those opposite, seemingly ignorant of the fact that the Asian bee was found when they were in office and no program to do anything about it was put in place until we came to office. There was no program at all. The Asian bee was found in Queensland in May 2007, when Peter McGauran was the minister, and nothing was done.The member for New England also referred to the fact that this is much bigger than the honey industry. The pollination services that are provided by bees go to a whole series of industries and make a massive difference to the productivity of those industries. There are a number of things that need to be put on the table and understood here. First of all, no other country has ever managed to eradicate Asian bees once they have arrived. -  - The one who did not try was Peter McGauran. He was one of yours, okay? He is the one who did not try. Secondly, since the first detection of Asian honey bees in Queensland in May 2007, the Australian government - since we came to office - has worked closely with the Queensland government, the states and territories and the Honey Bee Industry Council to prevent the establishment and spread of the pest. Thirdly, the Asian Honey Bee National Management Group is an independent science based group which comprises federal, state and territory government officers, representatives of Plant Health Australia and representatives of the Honey Bee Industry Council.In addition, the decision the member for New England referred to was based on a number of scientific factors from the national management group. It was not a decision of government. That decision of the national management group was based on scientific factors, including the breeding rate of the bees, their tendency to swarm and their ability to cover extraordinarily long distances when they swarm, which has created significant difficulties in locating all of the nests and destroying them. The decision that that management group has made reflects the scientific assessment of the feasibility of eradication but does not amount to a decision that there will not be continued engagement in other areas other than eradication in terms of control.As I said, funding prior to us coming to government amounted to zero dollars. Funding decisions since then, through a series of ministerial council decisions, have involved continued extension of the eradication programs. At the November 2010 meeting - the last time the Primary Industries Ministerial Council considered this - they decided to extend funding until 31 March this year. Further funding approval beyond that is a decision yet to be made by the ministerial council, but the decision that the member for New England has raised is a decision of the scientific committee. Obviously, the concerns that he has raised will be passed on directly to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question. The government has set out a plan to tackle climate change by establishing a carbon price through a market mechanism. Of course, a carbon price through a market mechanism is going to be the most economically efficient way of cutting pollution and driving investment in clean energy.On the other side of the chamber, we have the so-called direct action policy. What we know from scrutinising that policy is that it demonstrates that it would cost over $30 billion rather than the claimed $10.5 billion, which would mean that the average Australian family would be $720 a year worse off under the Leader of the Opposition's direct action policy. Furthermore, under that policy - a direct cost to the budget - there will not be a single dollar of assistance for households to meet those costs.Under direct action any future government is going to face a $30 billion budget black hole. That $30 billion is going to need to be met through higher taxes or cuts in expenditure and cuts to services. Without that expenditure, the opposition has no hope of achieving its stated target of a five per cent cut in emissions by the year 2020. It is bad economics and it is bad for the environment. Interestingly enough, the shadow minister, the member for Flinders, has not in the course of the day - and I have been watching - effectively attempted to deny their figures. He does not deny the $30 billion black hole and he does not deny the $720 cost to families. Instead, the problem is to be solved with the magic bullet of soil carbon.Not only are there significant questions about the science of sequestering carbon through the soil but there are also agreed international rules that prevent us counting soil carbon as abatement for our pollution reduction targets. The member for Flinders seems to be implying that it is all going to be okay because he is going to change the international accounting rules. He is going to go to the UN and convince 190-odd countries to change the international accounting rules. I cannot see it happening in a hurry.The opposition have run out all sorts of interference today. They have likened the Prime Minister and other government ministers to Colonel Gaddafi and all sorts of ridiculous things, but they have not effectively answered this question about their own policy. They will not stand up for market principles. Their policy is a farce. The shadow Treasurer has been pretty vocal about this issue. He is well and truly on the record as a man of market principles. Only some months ago, in the book by Lenore Taylor and David Uren, he said:I was acting industry minister in 2002 when Peter Costello, David Kemp and I argued, unsuccessfully at that stage, in the Howard cabinet that we should have an ETS.He went on to say:I believe the market mechanism is the best way to price a commodity. I am a true believer in markets.Why don't you act on it? - Ditch this silly direct action policy and embrace the economically responsible approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. What we know is that an emissions trading scheme is the cheapest, most cost-effective way of dealing with carbon pollution and driving the creation of jobs, particularly in renewable energy. That is a fact. Whether you go back to the Stern report in the UK, a report of much higher standing than any that could have been quoted by the shadow Treasurer, or the Treasury modelling that was conducted here recently or indeed most of the reputable work around the world, it all points to the fact that a price on carbon is the cheapest way to drive investment and jobs. It is the cheapest and most efficient way of making your economy more competitive for the long term.There is a very clear difference between this side of the House and those on the other side. We on this side of the House want to charge polluters because they should not be allowed to pollute for free. - We want to use the revenue to assist households that may be impacted upon, as well as industries that may be impacted upon. - Nothing could be more relevant than having an emissions trading scheme, which is the cheapest and most-efficient way to reduce carbon pollution and drive investment in the jobs of the future. There is a very clear contrast between our approach and that of those opposite. What they want to do is use a direct action policy which taxes families to hand money to polluters. That is inefficient and it is not sustainable. As the modelling which has been published today shows, their direct action model will cost $30 billion, or $720 for every family, when it is fully operational. There is a very clear contrast. - We on this side of the House want to charge polluters and assist industry and households. Those on the other side of the House want to put an unsustainable bill of $30 billion on the public purse, which will be paid for by average families, and give that money to polluters. That is the alternative that we are debating here. No wonder they are so rabid when the contrast is put in that way. - Their policy is not efficient, and the member for Wentworth has already pointed this out. Consider for a moment what $30 billion is equivalent to. - It is equivalent to the entire education budget. It is equivalent to our support for pharmaceutical benefits for three years.</DOC>

 - We will wait for the inevitable 'Aha!' moment in the supplementary question. Let me be very clear with the Leader of the Opposition about my view. My view is that Australia should not lead the world but we should not be left behind either. We have a high-emissions economy. We cannot afford to be stranded with that high-emissions economy while other nations change and the world changes. There are other nations that are changing; there are other parts of the world changing. Thirty-two other nations have got emissions trading schemes; 10 US states have got emissions trading schemes. The world is changing.Because we are, by the standards of the developed world, the biggest per capita emitters of carbon pollution, we have got a lot of changing to do. What that means is that we cannot afford to be left behind the world, and to make the amount of change we need is a major transformation and a major amount of change. That means we need to get started, which is why I have determined we will price carbon from 1 July 2012.To the Leader of the Opposition I say: of course the challenge of climate change is a global challenge; of course it involves more than Australia in meeting this global challenge; and of course we will continue to press in the councils of the world for the world to act on climate change.But at every point we should act in Australia's national interest. Australia's national interest demands that we do not get left behind with a high-pollution economy and that we transform our economy in a measured and sensible way. Pricing carbon from 1 July 2012 will mean we can start that major journey of transformation in a measured and sensible way; whereas, if we leave our high carbon polluting economy unreformed and then the world moves, and then we are left behind, it will be a dramatic shock for the Australian economy to then transform.My prism is Australia's national interest. My prism is Australian jobs. My prism is making sure our economy is a clean energy economy of the future. And my confidence is we have seen major economic reforms in this country in the past. They have been opposed at the time, but, when we look at the track record of what those major reforms have achieved, they have given us the prosperous economy we have today. The nation is up to this, the government is up to this and we will get it done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. He joined me, with the member for Canberra, Senator Kate Lundy and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, at the War Memorial this morning to make an important announcement. I was at the War Memorial last week when the new Hall of Valour was opened. It was a very great privilege to be there with our VC holders - three very gallant Australians. It was a very great privilege to be there and to have the opportunity to speak. I described the traditions of the War Memorial and I recalled John Curtin's famous words that it is the 'sanctuary of Australia's traditions'. I endorse those words today, as I did when I spoke at the opening of the Hall of Valour last week. I believe all members in this place, indeed all Australians, want to see the War Memorial properly resourced and maintaining its fantastic reputation as sacred ground for Australians and a place they can go to reflect on the costs and consequences of war and to admire the acts of courage, bravery and mateship that our forces have engaged in in every conflict that they have been involved in.In the course of last year, I became concerned about the long-term funding arrangements of the War Memorial. I wanted to see the War Memorial on a sustainable footing for the future. I also wanted to make sure that when we celebrate the centenary of Anzac in 2015 - it is preparation time as such a significant national and international event is not far away - the War Memorial has available to it the resources to do the job. Consequently, late last year I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to do the job properly, to work with the War Memorial, to work with the department and to make some decisions about long-term sustainable funding. I did not want to see a result which was worked out on the back of an envelope. I wanted proper advice and a proper and thorough look at the funding of the Australian War Memorial.In line with that review undertaken by the minister for finance and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I today announced that we will add $8 million per year to the funding of the War Memorial. This will join the $38 million already allocated to the War Memorial and will be indexed for the future. This is important for sustainability over time. But we also now need to be making appropriate preparations and arrangements for the centenary of Anzac commemorations in 2015. In addition, today I announce that I am appointing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as a minister assisting me with the preparation of the centenary of Anzac commemorations and that we will allocate an extra $1.7 million to the War Memorial to enable it to revamp its exhibition of the First World War. As we move towards the centenary, more and more Australians will want to see that exhibition. I want it to be in first-class shape, and I know that the Australian War Memorial staff will do an excellent job with preparing that exhibition for 2015.</DOC>

 - I will show my usual caution when it comes to the opposition and the use of quotes because we know that as recently as 48 hours ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  -  - I will show the usual caution because not 48 hours ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was in here misquoting by cutting a sentence in half, deliberately only quoting a section of a sentence and thereby giving the Australian people and this House of Representatives a misleading impression. So what we know from performances just 48 hours ago is you cannot trust the opposition with much and you certainly cannot trust them to quote accurately.On the question of the views of the Minister for Resources and Energy and Tourism, I thank the shadow Treasurer for pointing out he has a very fine head of hair, and that very fine head of hair is on top of a head with a very fine mind inside it. The minister, using that very fine mind, is working with me and the government to price carbon because he knows, as I do, that our high carbon pollution economy needs to be transformed and we need to be using the clean energy sources of the future. If anybody wants a lecture on clean energy sources for the future, I would recommend to them spending eight to 10 to 12 hours with the minister, because he will be able to lecture for that amount of time because he has thought deeply about our need for renewable energy sources, he has thought deeply about our need to transform the Australian economy so it is a low-pollution, clean energy economy for the future.I thank the opposition for giving me the opportunity because the minister does take questions in this House but, given we have only been running at three or four for question time, he has not had an opportunity this week to explain himself, his vision for carbon pricing - the same as mine - his vision for a clean energy future, and to explain to the House his deep expertise in renewable sources of energy.</DOC>

 - Today we have received the very important news that the Senate will support the temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy. I know it is strongly supported by all members on this side of the House and of course the Independents and minor parties in this House, and it will be supported by the Independents and minor parties in the Senate. What we have seen is terrible floods, terrible fires, and of course a terrible cyclone in Far North Queensland. We have seen devastation and we have seen very great need in our communities. That is why the government has worked with the Independents, the Greens and the minor parties to get support in place so we can get the reconstruction going.Today in data from the Bureau of Statistics we have further evidence of the damage that has been done in Queensland. Both the trade figures today and the building approvals figures today show the size of the challenge that we face - in particular in rebuilding in Queensland. The damage has been great - damage of private property and personal possessions, and also public infrastructure. Under the disaster arrangements the Commonwealth is up for something like 75 per cent of most of the critical infrastructure, and we have come to this task with good faith, understanding the damage that has been done in North Queensland, in Far North Queensland, in Central Queensland, in western Queensland, in South-East Queensland, in Victoria, and by the fires in Western Australia.So the passage of this legislation is absolutely essential - because the government understands that we have to pay as we go. We do have to pay as we go; there is no free way of doing this. Those opposite simply do not understand the challenge of the economic task before us, nor do they understand the urgent need to rebuild in Queensland. What we have had with the Leader of the Opposition is all opposition and no leadership. Not only is he saying no to the rebuilding of Queensland and other parts of Australia through the flood levy - just like he said no during the global financial crisis, just like he says no to the NBN - what we have is all opposition and no leadership. We have an opposition leader that becomes more extreme by the day, playing the politics of race, playing the politics of religion -  - Everyone on this side of the House is proud to support a temporary levy to rebuild parts of Australia that have been damaged very badly by cyclone and flood. And what has been the opposition to that? It has been extremism from that side of the House, where they are taking their policies from One Nation. - You do not know whether it is Tony Hanson or Pauline Abbott sitting in that seat! -  - The government and the minor parties and the Independents support this legislation because it is good for Australia. It is helping Australians in need. It is the positive approach we need to governing Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for this question. Of course I am aware of the aluminium industry in Victoria, which he refers to. I am sure that he would freely acknowledge that it is there in Victoria because of the work of Labor Premier John Cain. His administration ensured that regional Victoria had the benefit of those jobs. I am sure the member acknowledges to his constituency every day the leading role of former Labor Premier John Cain!What I would say to the member who has asked the question is that I am all about Australian jobs. That requires us not to freeze our economy in time, not to look to the past, but to build for the future. I say to the member who has asked me the question: presumably he could have got up in this parliament many long years ago, if he had been here under the Hawke government, and he could have asked a similarly phrased question about an industry that was having its tariffs reduced. He could have asked the Prime Minister then, 'Will you guarantee no job losses?'What is the history of tariff reform, economic reform, floating the dollar, and trade liberalisation in this country? All of these reforms have built our modern economy. The legacy of those reforms is the prosperous economy we have today. If we had said, in the 1970s, 1980s or even the 1990s that we were going to freeze our economy in time we would be poorer today than we are now. -  - What I was saying to the member is that during any of the waves of economic reform and transformation of our economy there are people who raise fears about job losses but economic reform and economic transformation, on every occasion, have left us stronger and more prosperous than we were before, and far stronger and far more prosperous than we would have been had we tried to freeze our economy in time.The future will be owned by those nations who are able to be nimble and adapt to a low-carbon future. I am for this nation being nimble and adapting to a low-carbon future. The course of freezing our economy in time is actually a course towards a poorer nation. It is a course towards fewer job opportunities for the constituents that the member represents in this place.If the member does not want to trust me on these propositions then he should turn to former Prime Minister John Howard, who was honest enough to say to the Australian people that we needed to transform our economy through an emissions trading scheme. I am being as honest as he was with the Australian people. We need to transform our economy. We need to price carbon. Former Prime Minister John Howard went to the 2007 election promising that, and the commitments I have made in this place and to the Australian nation are comparable commitments. We must price carbon. We must transform our economy. We must embrace the challenges of the future, not try and run away. So, do not be led down that path by the Leader of the Opposition. Play a role in shaping the future; work with the government to price carbon.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for his very important question. I think that he, like everyone on this side of the House, is absolutely intent on making sure, for families and businesses, that we have the most competitive banking system we can get - a system that delivers the best value to Australian families and businesses in this country.Can I say that we do look forward to working with the cross-benchers and the minor parties both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate in the passage of our very important reforms to the banking system to make it much more competitive. To that end I met with the consumer group Choice this morning to discuss their reaction to a number of the very positive proposals that we are progressing. An example is the abolition of mortgage exit fees on new home loans - a very important reform - so that if people are unhappy with their banks they can go down the road.But of course those opposite are intent on opposing that. They are standing up for mortgage exit fees on new home loans as high as $7,000. That is the stance they have. We are looking forward to working with Choice and other community organisations and all the members from this side of the House on making sure that we do everything we can to progress account portability.This is very difficult and it is the case that no country in the world has yet achieved full account portability. But we have got Bernie Fraser working on this task and he will come back to the government with a report on that. This is a very important part of our financial system. Any changes have to be made in a methodical and careful way. So we do look forward to the report from Bernie Fraser. We also have the Treasury working with the Reserve Bank when it comes to ATM fees and charges and the question about account inquiries. Those two bodies will take that into account in their current deliberations. For our part, on this side of the House we are absolutely committed to a competitive banking system, unlike those opposite who just stand for high mortgage exit fees.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. I trust that all members of the House are able at this point to unite and say that our alliance with the United States has had bipartisan support for 60 years. Indeed we are celebrating the 60th year and that is a great celebration. There has been bipartisan support from the days when John Curtin said to this nation that we should look to America. There has been bipartisan support as we have made our way in the world in times of war and in times of peace.I have described the relationship between our two countries as being 'great mates'. I have had the opportunity to meet with President Obama at the G20, at the APEC meeting, and at the NATO meeting discussing the further strategy in Afghanistan. When I met with President Obama at the APEC meeting he invited me to visit Washington early this year, and I will be accepting that invitation and travelling to America this weekend to meet with President Obama.In America when meeting with President Obama I intend to pursue discussions on a broad range of fronts for Australia. First and foremost, we will be discussing the way in which the globe is emerging from the global financial crisis. There are still challenges to the global economy. Australia has emerged very strong indeed, but I think we are all aware that there continue to be challenges in the global economy that need to be worked through and discussed, and I look forward to those discussions with President Obama.Secondly, we will be discussing our joint mission in Afghanistan. This was part of what was discussed at the NATO meeting in ISAF format, which I attended late last year with the endorsement of the strategy put forward by General Petraeus, the strategy that informed the statement I made to this House about our future strategy in Afghanistan as we move to transition. Of course I will be pursuing discussion on Afghanistan and the way ahead.I will be talking to President Obama about our region and the importance of the emerging new regional architecture including the East Asia Summit in which the US and China will participate -  - Thank you to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if I could just finish my answer without her catcalling, that would be very useful. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. You do not want to trust her with a quote either. The emerging regional architecture involving the US sitting at the table, bringing the US to the table with China and with the other major economies of our region and with Russia at the table, is a very important development. And of course we will be talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama made it very clear at APEC that he has an aspiration to see the Trans-Pacific Partnership concluded with an interim result in Honolulu when he leads APEC at the end of this year.I also will have the very great honour of addressing a joint sitting of congress in the US. I view this as an honour for our nation and I am very much looking forward to the opportunity. I will update the House when it next sits on my discussions in the United States.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I would say to the member, of course people are going to put a variety of views in this debate, but in terms of what the business community is saying to this nation, I would refer him to the fact that the following major businesses have said that they are in favour of carbon pricing. -  - I have got to disagree with the members' interjections. There are more businesses in this country than just the ones referred to. There is a business called BHP, for example, and BHP is in favour of pricing carbon. There is a business called Telstra which is in favour of pricing carbon. Xstrata Coal, TRU Energy, AGL Energy, Santos -  - I was asked about jobs; I was asked about manufacturing. Consequently, I am giving the view of a number of businesses who would care about jobs. On businesses that deal with manufacturing I would point the member who asked the question in the direction of General Motors Holden. They are a manufacturer and they are in favour of pricing carbon. The member might want to think: why do these very big businesses, including a major manufacturing business, want to price carbon? It is because they know that the world economy is going to change. They know that our economy needs to change. They have prospered so far by innovating, by changing, by making sure that they are in front of world trends. We would not have Holden in this country if it had not been capable of innovating. If it were still making the cars of yesterday, it would be out of business. Telstra would not be a business in this country if it had not innovated. If it had said when the information technology revolution came along, 'I know what we'll do, we'll stick with the fixed line network and we'll give all of that new technology to someone else,' Telstra would not be a big business in this country.Businesses in this country prosper because they look at the future, they respond and they innovate and that is what putting a price on carbon pollution is about: driving innovation. I am an incredible optimist about the dynamism and strength of our business community. I am an incredible optimist about the ability of our nation's economy to adapt to this challenge. Every lesson from history teaches me that we should be optimistic. The death of Australian manufacturing has been predicted from the days that Bob Hawke as Prime Minister determined to reduce tariffs. Everybody said, 'That's it, manufacturing - gone.'Earlier this week I drove the new Holden Cruze off the production line. Claims about the death of manufacturing were wrong then and they are wrong now. Of course, as we move to this low-pollution, clean energy economy there will be businesses that need assistance in the transition. I understand that and, as we work through the policy of pricing carbon, we will obviously be looking at the needs of Australian businesses.An opposition member - What is a car made of? - The member is helpfully interjecting, 'What is a car made of?' I happen to know and I was driving a new car off the Holden production line this week, a business that has innovated. I say to him: stop trying to generate fear, stop underestimating Australian industry, stop talking Australian manufacturing down. They are smart, they are agile, they will keep up, they will innovate and they will prosper for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. We have spent a number of parliamentary weeks now and as parliament has sat it has become clearer and clearer that, whilst the government pursues day after day the national interest, we are seeing the opposition day after day pursue its political interest. We are seeing once again a day of a fear campaign. Today's theme is a fear campaign about Australian jobs. Yesterday's campaign was a fear campaign about not enough information. Curiously, two days before we had a fear campaign about price rises, which they said at that stage they could put a dollar figure on, so the inconsistency in these fear campaigns might cause some to pause and reflect. But it is a fear campaign.Where have we heard these fear campaigns before? Let's just think back on the short number of parliamentary weeks since the start of this year. We had a fear campaign about the flood levy. For a while the opposition thought that it was onto a winner. I announced the $5.6 billion package to rebuild Queensland, to rebuild the nation, and the opposition was straight out of the blocks saying: 'Australians will never accept this. This will break the government. It won't get through the parliament. People will never accept this. They'll never take it. People should ring talkback. People should complain.' Of course the opposition was squealing with delight. - I was asked about the national interest and I do consider rebuilding from the most expensive natural disaster in the nation's history as a challenge. It is a challenge we are up to and a challenge that we have allocated $5.6 billion for and that is before we made the allocation for the damage stemming from the cyclone. - That of course has been a challenge the government has stepped up to in the face of an opposition fear campaign. I ask members of this parliament and the public to reflect today: where is that fear campaign? The parliament has indicated that it will pass the flood levy legislation - where is that fear campaign? Like all fear campaigns, when it was really held up to the light it just fell away. - Of course we have seen fear campaigns in other areas. We have seen fear campaigns about health. - Of course, we saw fear campaigns and criticism about our health package - condemned out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition before it was announced. But the government will deliver that health package because we need to reform health for the future. We have had opposition criticisms of our education reforms, but we will deliver those reforms, including MySchool 2.0 tomorrow, another step in transforming Australian education. We have heard opposition fear campaigns about the National Broadband Network, but we will build the National Broadband Network so that Australians have access to the jobs and services of the future. There is a theme here. It is: who is up to acting in the national interest, dealing with the challenges of the future? Who is it that always looks to the short-term, narrow political interest and always says no? Australians want to see positive leadership for this nation's future and we will continue to provide that positive leadership. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there will come a day when Australians will look at him and say, 'Why is he incapable of saying yes to any positive proposition for the nation's future?' - National interest versus political interest - that is the divide in this parliament.</DOC>

Can I say to the member for Goldstein and, more broadly, to the opposition: I anticipate that we will be back here for the next sitting week and they will be saying: 'Christmas will be cancelled! Children will not get Easter eggs! The tooth fairy will never come!' This is where we will get to in the next few sitting weeks - absurd proposition on absurd proposition. These people cower in the face of the challenges of the future. These people cower and they ask the Australian nation to cower with them. They ask the Australian nation to say to itself -  - Thank you very much. This is another part of the opposition's fear campaign. On this fear campaign we say to Australians: 'Don't fall for it. They are asking you to cower in the face of the future.' They are asking Australians to believe that they are incapable of change. Australians are smart, competent people. They are up to this. They will get it done and they will leave the opposition stranded as history marches past them.</DOC>

 - Predictably, the scare campaign continues with the made-up facts and figures, and the Leader of the Opposition does what he always does, which is to seek to cause fear amongst the Australian community, because he has no policies or plans for the nation's future and he tries to hide that behind a never-ending series of fear campaigns.Mr Speaker, do you recall the start of this parliamentary session, when the Leader of the Opposition was trying to raise fear amongst the Australian community about the government's proposed flood levy? Day after day in question time, we came in here and questions were asked and answered about the flood levy. Fear was being raised -  - the sense that somehow the future of the Australian nation would be jeopardised if that legislation passed the parliament. We do not hear about that anymore, do we? We do not hear about it. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was making the simple point that already this year we have seen a scare campaign answered and dealt with, and the Leader of the Opposition is too embarrassed to even go back to that scare campaign now. So of course he has to start a new scare campaign, and we are seeing today's scare campaign on display. But that is all it is: a scare campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, making up figures each and every day -  - making up figures in order to cause alarm in the Australian community. But the Australian community are smarter than the Leader of the Opposition gives them credit for. The Australian community believes that climate change is real. Yes, that is a substantial difference from the Leader of the Opposition's backbench, which is populated by sceptics and deniers. The Australian community believes climate change is real, and the Australian community wants to see us in this place providing practical answers to this challenge of climate change, and that is exactly what the government is doing.Reputable economists tell us that the most cost-effective way of dealing with the challenge of carbon pollution is to put a price on it, and that is what we will do. We will put a price on pollution - a price that polluters will pay. We will provide generous assistance to Australian families and, because we are a Labor government, the assistance that is provided to Australian families will be fair assistance.In the meantime, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? It depends. It depends if he is on Alan Jones or in front of a community meeting, in which case he is a climate change denier. Then, if he gets out in front of what he thinks is a more responsible audience, he pretends to believe in climate change. Whether or not the Leader of the Opposition believes in climate change depends on what day you catch him. As the member for Wentworth said, he is the ultimate weathervane in Australian politics: no policies; no plans; no beliefs; no convictions; just slogans and a scare campaign, and that is all we are seeing again today. -

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I know she believes climate change is real and she represents a community that wants to see action. I think she probably represents a community that is also very pleased to see a strong female role model in this parliament representing their community. I think that is the spirit of modern Australia. Sometimes in this parliament we do not see that spirit of equal opportunity on display.On the question that I have been asked by the member for La Trobe, we need to invest in a clean energy future because we cannot risk being left behind. This nation is at risk of being left behind. Our competitors are investing in low emissions and renewable energy on a massive scale. The United States and Europe are now spending more on clean energy investments than on conventional investments. That is an important thing to recognise - more on clean energy investments. In 25 years, 80 per cent of America's energy needs will be supplied by clean energy sources.China is shutting down one high-polluting, inefficient and unsafe coal power plant every one to two weeks and replacing them with larger and economically and environmentally much more efficient plants. China is also the biggest producer of solar panels and is installing wind turbines at the rate of one per hour. India is taxing coal, reaping half a billion dollars to invest in clean energy. By 2022, they will generate enough power by solar alone to meet almost half of our energy needs. If we do not act now we will cost this country investment and jobs; we will cost this country future prosperity. We need to adapt to a low-carbon future. We are the highest emitter of carbon pollution in the developed world per capita, emitting more per head of population than even the United States.By pricing carbon under the mechanism the government has proposed, we will ask the 1,000 big polluters in our economy to pay for the carbon pollution they create. At this time when pollution can be put into the atmosphere for nothing we will put a price on it, and because there is a price business will innovate and business will find a lower-pollution way of doing what they do. They will become more efficient; they will generate less carbon pollution. As we do that, because it is a big adjustment, we will generously assist Australian households. We are a Labor government and we will do that fairly. We will assist businesses to make the transition and we will fund climate change programs.We believe climate change is real; the opposition are caught in denial. We want to make the big polluters pay; the opposition want to reward them. We want to help households; the opposition want to tax them $720 in order to subsidise polluters. We want to invest in clean energy; they want to invest in a scare campaign. We want to be driven and will be driven by the national interest; day after day we see political interest on display from the opposition. Despite their fear tactics, despite their scare campaign, we will get on with the job and price carbon to create a clean energy future for this country.</DOC>

 - I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I watch Channel Nine too, as it happens. I do have Channel Nine on the TV, I did watch that Laurie Oakes interview and I did watch the segment with President Obama that she is referring to. I do not think it was yesterday; I think it was the Sunday before that that went to air. We are seeing the usual degree of research and endeavour by the opposition we have come to expect because of their lazy approach to politics and their lazy approach to policy. Can I explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in answer to the question she asked me that yes, she is absolutely right. I did say before the last election campaign I wanted a full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme, and we will get a full cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for verifying that to the House.In referring to the segment with President Obama, No. 1, I think she would note that it was some time ago and, No. 2, she would note that President Obama has committed his nation to a clean energy future. President Obama is in a situation where, with the Congress the American people have elected, he is not in a position to legislate an emissions trading scheme. - The member for Goldstein says, why would we have one? The reality is - and let me explain this to the member for Goldstein - I am someone who shows a great deal of admiration for the United States of America. I think that was on display when I recently travelled there, but the member for Goldstein may not realise we are not little Americans; we make decisions for our own country.The member for Casey then left the chamber. - Every economist of any repute is telling us that the least costly way of dealing with carbon pollution is via pricing carbon. So why, as Prime Minister, would I deny this nation the most efficient, least-cost way of dealing with carbon pollution because President Obama has made a different decision? Why would I do that? Of course I would not. This nation deserves to have the least-cost way of dealing with carbon pollution, and that is pricing carbon. That is exactly what we will do, initially through a fixed-price - effectively like a tax - then moving to an emissions trading scheme, as I have outlined on behalf of the government and as I have outlined on behalf of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee.On the other side, what do we see as the alternative? What we see, of course, is them taking $30 billion out of the purses and wallets of Australians and giving it to big polluters. On this side, we will take money from big polluters and give it through generous assistance to households. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was indicating, the division here is whether you want to put a price on polluters and give assistance to households or whether you want to take money off households and give assistance to polluters. We will put a price on pollution. That price will be paid by polluters. We will generously assist households for the price impacts that they will experience. I have been very upfront about that. What the opposition wants to do is take money off Australian households and give it to big polluters. The opposition should come clean about that. Their price tag for Australians is $720 straight off them, straight out of their purses, straight out of their wallets and straight to a polluter.

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question, because it is imperative that we price carbon to ensure that we have sustainable economic growth. Sustainable economic growth does require a price on carbon because we need the investment to drive the technology to make ourselves much more energy efficient. We need that investment to get the investment in renewable energy so that we can create the jobs for the future. Of course, the economics of this are not seriously contested by many. They certainly are by sceptics on the other side of the House, but the economics of this were accepted widely in this parliament only 18 months ago. The economics of this go back to the report by Lord Stern in 2006. -  - There we go: the sceptics opposite are now going to dispute the Stern report, the most fundamental analysis of the economics of climate change that we have seen -  - and which is widely accepted, particularly in Britain, even by conservative politicians, as being the roadmap for the future. What Lord Stern said is that tackling climate change is the only pro-growth strategy for the future - that is, if we do not act on climate change, the damage to our environment and therefore the damage to our economy will be great, and if we wish our economies to grow then we must put a price on carbon. In Australia we are the highest per capita polluters in the world. That makes it even more imperative that we deal with the price on carbon.Of course, all of these points were made last week by Professor Garnaut - most particularly, the importance of a price on carbon to drive the investment in the technology, particularly in renewable energy, which will create the jobs of the future.Of course, this was accepted at one stage by all of those opposite. It was only 18 months ago when those on that side of the House all favoured an emissions trading system.The member for Indi then left the chamber. - There are many on that side of the House who now clearly do not accept the science of climate change and do not accept the economics of dealing with climate change. We had a conservative politician in the country in the last few days - Lord Deben. Lord Deben described climate change sceptics as 'oddballs'. The problem the coalition has is that the oddballs have taken over. The oddballs - the climate change sceptics - have taken over on that side of the House but only 18 months ago they did accept the science of climate change. Now they do not. We had the Leader of the Opposition say only in the last week or so:_ the so-called settled science of climate change isn't always quite what it's claimed to be.So there he was, outing himself as a climate change sceptic. We know that he thinks that climate change is crap. - Mr Speaker, Lord Stern described climate change as the greatest market failure in the history of the world. What we are witnessing in this House is the greatest political failure we have ever seen from the Liberal Party. - The climate change sceptics have taken over and that endangers our prosperity and jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. Let me make the following things very clear to the Leader of the Nationals. I have always believed that climate change is real. That is my belief; that is the belief of the Labor Party. In answer to that belief, we accept the science. The Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition has on some days accepted the science and on other days rejected the science. He has accepted it some days; rejected it other days. On Alan Jones he rejects the science. If he is in front of a Canberra press gallery then he accepts the science. He has no belief in these questions because he just does not care about climate change and about this country's future economic prosperity and future environment. - I was asked about matters in the 2010 election. I am making it very clear that in the 2007 election and in the 2010 election Labor contested both elections saying to the Australian people, 'Climate change is real; we need to price carbon. The best way of doing that is through an emissions trading scheme where you cap the amount of carbon pollution your economy can generate and you allow the market to generate the price.' We said that to the Australian people in 2007. We said that to the Australian people in 2010. What is interesting about that 2007 election is that Prime Minister Howard said the same thing to the Australian people. He said exactly the same thing. And Prime Minister Howard had the guts to say to the Australian people that this would have price impacts for them. He had the guts to say to the Australian people that he would deal with those price impacts through assistance - that is, he was being honest and clear with the Australian people about the nature of the problem and the required solution. -  - In contrast to that we have the current position of the Leader of the Opposition who says, about climate change, what he thinks the audience is going to endorse, not what he believes in, because he does not care enough about the issue to have any convictions about the issue.The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - In the 2010 election I said to the Australian people that we needed to price carbon and that we needed to get to an emissions trading scheme - and we will. I also indicated that I wanted to take the Australian people with us - and we will take the Australian people with us. There are mechanisms for the Australian people to engage with this debate, and we invite them to do so.The member for Forde then left the chamber. - The mechanisms for the community to engage in this debate include through the Climate Commission led by Tim Flannery. People will also be able to engage with Professor Garnaut, who continues to make very important contributions to our national debate and our national stream of information about climate change through his papers. The most recent one was released late last week, and I would commend it to people. So my answer is of course that we want the community to come with us on this journey. They understand climate change is real and they want to see action, and we will be explaining that action to them. You, of course, will be mired in denial and fear because that is what the coalition does.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he is concerned about this issue and he has raised the matter directly with me. I say to the member for Denison and to the parliament the following. The government and defence are committed to maintaining the defence presence in Tasmania. It is the case, as the member for Denison is aware, that defence is undertaking a comprehensive review of defence's basing requirements. No decisions have been made on the future of individual bases included in the review, and that includes the bases in Tasmania. It is expected that the review will be completed mid-year, following which it is planned that a government appointed independent commission will consider defence's recommendations. It is intended that the commission will conduct public consultation before reporting back to the government. To the member for Denison I say I will not pre-empt the outcome of this process.The member has asked about the Anglesea Barracks. I can say that there are currently a number of very important defence establishments in Tasmania. In the case of Anglesea Barracks, this is an historic site of immense importance to the Army, defence and the Commonwealth. Anglesea Barracks is the oldest continuously occupied defence establishment in Australia. Anglesea Barracks will be celebrating its 200th anniversary in December this year, and the Anglesea 200 project committee is planning for the celebrations that will recognise the milestone event that this forms in Australia and Tasmania's military and defence history. I am advised defence has given no consideration to closing the base or to disposing of the base, and I do not expect that to occur in the future. I would expect the government of the day to not agree to any recommendation to take that course.The member has also asked about the Defence Community Organisation. Defence is committed to providing Defence Community Organisation services in Tassie. I am advised that a Defence Community Organisation workforce review is underway to ensure the Defence Community Organisation offers the best possible service to defence families nationally. But I can assure the member there will be no overall reduction in services to ADF families in Tasmania.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Of course, the foundation for a genuine climate change policy is respect for the science, and mainstream scientists are telling all governments internationally that carbon pollution is contributing to warming, and that is related to climate change. The fact of the matter is that the science is overwhelming, and the Australian government respects the science.There is an interesting opinion piece in today's Australian by John Gummer, a former member of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, which said the following:_ in Britain, scepticism is confined to the extremes. The political parties embracing it are way out on the edge of the spectrum with views on most other matters that few of us would embrace.That is an interesting contribution. One wonders what Mr Gummer would have to say about the comments of the Leader of the Opposition a short period, a week or so, ago in Perth, when he said:I don't think we can say that the science is settled here._            _            __ whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.Of course, what we have here is someone who does not respect the science, who is a sceptic about it, who is a denier of the scientific evidence - but who wishes, for politically opportune reasons, to be respected on some level and so rushes out a day or two after making these comments to confirm that he does in fact respect the science. He has had so many different positions on this that it is completely confusing. One day he denies the science, the next day he says it is credible and the next day he takes something off the One Nation website. First he listens to Senator Minchin, and then he pays attention to Senator Bernardi. As the member for Wentworth said about the Leader of the Opposition, on this issue he is a weather vane. Of course, many Australians disagree with Mr Abbott. They accept the science, they respect it and they want action on climate change.There has been plenty of public debate and assessment of opinion about these issues recently. One poll, led by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Curtin, is particularly interesting. On her website last Wednesday night, in answer to the question, 'Do you support a carbon tax or not?', 76.6 per cent of respondents poll strongly supported a carbon tax. That was by about 11 o'clock at night. Within 20 minutes - I think after a staffer or someone had had a look at the website - a couple of thousand new entries had been made, bringing the issue back into some balance, and that was immediately followed by the closure of the poll and the website.This is the quality of contribution that comes from those opposite on all of these issues. Mr Gummer is right to say that those denying the science and opposing action on climate change are at the edge of the political spectrum. Across Europe, mainstream parties on the left and right of politics all respect the science and all support tackling climate change; they do not dodgy up polls about the issues. The coalition's position on this issue is the crudest opportunism that one could imagine on this issue. Across the world governments respect the science, but not this coalition led by the Leader of the Opposition. The responsible position in the national interest of this country is to respect the science and have a credible response to it, something that this leader of the opposition lacks.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and I am glad to see that he has replaced the former shadow spokesperson on this issue. On the question that he has asked me about Christmas Island, what I can say to the shadow minister for immigration is as follows. First and foremost, criminal charges can be laid by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions following a police investigation into these incidents. This kind of violence and destruction is wrong. It is criminal behaviour and, just as we would expect in any other part of the nation, if someone has engaged in criminal behaviour, then the police investigate and charges can follow a proper investigation process.Under the Migration Act, as the member is probably aware, character is an important consideration in determining whether or not someone should be granted a visa. The minister for immigration has said that this will be considered on a case-by-case basis. As is proper, the Migration Act requires him to consider cases one at a time and to have his decisions turn on the facts of an individual case. But, as the minister has said, as these matters are considered on a case-by-case basis, character considerations will be taken into account for those on Christmas Island who have organised and perpetrated this sort of activity.I say generally to the member and to the House what I have said publicly and am happy to repeat here: this kind of conduct by individuals on Christmas Island is grossly wrong. This kind of conduct can and should cause criminal charges to flow following a proper police investigation. We know from our ordinary understanding of the law that acts of violence and acts of destruction are criminal acts. This kind of violence and conduct can and will be taken into account under the proper procedures of the Migration Act. What I would say to the member is that, as I have said publicly, no-one who engages in this kind of conduct will profit from it. No-one who does it will profit from it. The minister for immigration has made that absolutely clear, and I am very happy to restate it in this place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The international community has been justifiably horrified by the brutality meted out by the Libyan regime towards its own people. That is why the international community has welcomed the action agreed by the United Nations Security Council in New York last Friday to protect the Libyan people from the brutality of their own regime, and that is why the Australian government has welcomed the action of the UN Security Council. The Libyan regime has forfeited any claim to international legitimacy because of its murderous behaviour towards its own people. Its actions in this campaign will be recorded as among the more barbarous actions by any state in the world's modern history.There are two critical parts to the UN Security Council's resolution of 17 March 2011. The first empowers member states to use all necessary measures to create a no-fly zone over Libya. The second empowers member states to deploy all necessary measures to protect the Libyan people under threat of attack by the Libyan regime. Further, following on the passage of this by the UN Security Council last Friday, two days later, on 19 March, the US, France and the UK commenced military actions against the Libyan regime in accordance with the provisions and authorisation of UN Security Council Resolution 1973. These actions, we are advised, will be followed by further actions by other states, including Arab states. Had the international community not acted in the manner it has over the last three days, today we would instead be witnessing the butchery of Benghazi, because those citizens would have been left to their own devices.This will be a difficult military operation. It has been described by the US military spokesman as phase 1 of a multiphase military operation. The political outcome, of course, will be uncertain. Had the international community not acted in solidarity and support, the people of Libya would have been left to their own fate - having dared to raise their voices in the name of freedom and the rest of the world having joined in and cheered them on as they moved towards Tripoli - and, had the world community started to go silent, we would have learnt nothing from the experiences of Rwanda, Darfur and the Balkans. Instead, the international community did act.Australia, for its part, is now the third-largest contributor to the humanitarian effort globally, after the United States and after the European Union, in support of those fleeing Libya right now, and we will continue to maintain our effort into the future. The government elsewhere is monitoring closely other developments in the Middle East, across North Africa and in Egypt, as well as in Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain and other Gulf states. On these matters, most recently in Bahrain, I spoke with the Bahraini foreign minister last night expressing Australia's concern about violence in that particular country.Australia's interests remain seized by these events. These events in the Middle East impact the ability of terrorists to operate across the Middle East, they impact on Iran's freedom of manoeuvre across the Middle East and beyond, they impact on the Israel-Palestine peace process, they impact on the ability to develop pluralist democracies in the Arab world and they impact on the global economy through inflation and the price of oil. For these reasons Australia's national interests are seized, our values are seized and our diplomacy will remain active.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Cook, who seems to have changed portfolio. There seems to have been an 'accident down at mill' recently following certain public interventions by the member for Cook on recent developments concerning asylum seekers, and now he seeks to shadow me rather than my friend and colleague the minister for immigration. We will see how the member for Cook's career evolves in the days and weeks ahead.The member for Cook refers to the proposals by the government concerning a regional protection framework and within that the concept of a regional processing centre. He specifically asked for progress on these matters. He should be aware that both I and my colleague the immigration minister have consulted with our counterparts, not just in the region but beyond as well, including both of us with the High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, myself most recently only two weeks ago. Furthermore, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that within the next couple of weeks the minister and myself will be attending the Bali processing meeting in Bali with the Indonesian foreign minister and with foreign ministers and representatives from across the region. That is the proper mechanism through which we determine a regional response to what is a problem not just for the Australian nation, not just for the wider region but in fact for the entire world.In fact, if the honourable member for Cook reflected for a moment on what is unfolding in the Middle East he would reflect on the fact that political instability there is likely to create further movement of peoples from the Middle East to the countries of Europe and beyond. That is why, rather than engaging in partisan opportunistic interventions in this debate, it would be wiser for any responsible member of this House to contribute productively to what is a global challenge, a regional challenge and a national challenge for Australia, and that is how the Australian government is currently engaged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. The government has in place a very strong fiscal strategy which will see a return to surplus well ahead of our peers. This strategy will mean that we will have some of the strongest public finances in the developed world. This is important because our economy will reach capacity in the years ahead. It is important that we maintain a very strong fiscal strategy.This is, of course, despite the awful disasters that we have seen, which will impact on growth as we go forward. We know the impact of the floods and cyclones in Queensland will detract from growth this year, but, to counter that, the underlying fundamentals of our economy are strong. We have very strong employment growth - over 300,000 jobs in the past year and 700,000 jobs over a three-year period. We are still seeing incomes strengthen and we have a very solid investment pipeline, particularly in resources - something like $380 billion. All of this underscores the need for a very strong and tight fiscal policy and the return to surplus.That is why the government acted responsibly. It is why we put in place the flood levy. It is why we made the savings to finance what we have to do to rebuild Queensland and other parts of the country. It is why we have our two per cent cap on spending growth. It is why we will continue to implement this strategy, to make sure that when the economy is stretched to capacity we have the appropriate fiscal policy. It was appropriate when the global recession came along for us to support our economy. Now it is appropriate for us to step back in these circumstances because of the strength of the employment pipeline.This has been consistent from day one and stands in stark contrast to the approach of those who sit opposite. Those who sit opposite pretend be concerned about levels of deficit and debt. They do this at the same time that they are blocking something like $5 billion worth of budget savings in the Senate. We hear the Leader of the Opposition and others on the front bench from time to time make suggestions about what we can do with spending, but we do not get any suggestions for savings. Indeed, we get the damage and the vandalism to the budget bottom line. On the one hand, they are running around the country saying, 'Deficits are bad,' and on the other hand they are saying, 'How can we make them bigger?' That is their approach to fiscal policy. It is one that is reckless and it is one that is absolutely irresponsible. That is why people absolutely understand that the economics team on the other side of the parliament is the most incompetent in generations. But we on this side of the House will keep on with responsible economic management and a responsible fiscal strategy.</DOC>

 - I thought the member for Stirling was the new shadow minister from immigration; it appears it is now the member for Mackellar. It is really getting better with every question.The government's answer to the issues facing us with asylum seekers is an international solution for an international problem; unlike the opposition, whose answer is a detention centre at Nauru and another on Christmas Island. We saw last week the real shadow minister for immigration slipping and sliding on the issue of whether 90 per cent of the people who are processed at Nauru ended up in Australia. He slipped and slid on it because it is a fact - it is the truth. Their policy is a complete fraud. We also heard about the policy of temporary protection visas, which saw the number of asylum seekers go up after its introduction. Most particularly, we heard the shadow minister's policy of allowing visas for the first 3,750 people to arrive in Australia, creating a scramble to come to Australia.We remain focused on the only sustainable policy, which is an international solution to an international problem. - An opposition member - The member for Boothby.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question because, as she knows, this government is committed to transforming Alice Springs and the town camps into safe places to live and bring up children and into places that are part of the economic and social life of Alice Springs. This government has invested $150 million through the Alice Springs Transformation Plan to reduce overcrowding in the town camps and to improve the services, something that has needed to be done in Alice Springs for a very, very long period of time. It is being done by this government and was certainly never done before.It is the case that the town camps in Alice Springs have been ignored for too long, leading to appalling living conditions for women and children in particular. I can assure the House that I am resolute in my commitment to the people of Alice Springs, and particularly to the people who live in the town camps, that we intend to turn this around. Where Mal Brough and the previous Liberal government walked away, we have persisted. They walked away from the people of the town camps, and we have persisted. When my action was challenged in the Federal Court, we persisted and we won. Despite the enormity of the transformation task, we intend to persist until change is delivered.I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's recent interest in this issue - and it is recent. I am very concerned that his actions overnight have put this issue into a political frame - rather than commit himself to the bipartisan approach that I thought we had. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition had raised the issue with the Prime Minister a couple of times, most recently on Friday, and I understand that at that time the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister agreed to meet and discuss the matter further. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition then decided to release his letter to the Prime Minister to a newspaper. He had decided that rather than behave in a bipartisan and constructive manner he of course wanted to take this into politics. He decided he wanted to behave as always and make this issue a political issue rather than treat it as the very serious issue that it is.This government will continue to work in a bipartisan manner with the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, who has treated this issue seriously, unlike the Leader of the Opposition. We have been meeting. We have agreed on what needs to be done in Alice Springs. Most recently we announced around 10 days ago: improved lighting in critical areas in Alice Springs; extra places for Work for the Dole; improved housing support - all agreed with the shadow minister, but of course this Leader of the Opposition is always out to play politics rather than take these issues seriously.The matters that were addressed in the most recent announcement agreed to by the shadow minister build on the enormous task that we have already started. We have already built many houses, rebuilt houses, put in alcohol rehabilitation services; all this is happening and all the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is play politics.  </DOC>

 - Thank you very much and it will not surprise you, Mr Speaker, when I say I have not brought the national curriculum with me. Of course the national curriculum is available through the website of the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority. What you will find when you look at the national curriculum, whether you look at the literature stream, whether you look at any part of it, is that it is conveying to students what has made our civilisation, what has made Western civilisation, including the values that guide us, the democratic structures under which we live, the rule of law under which we live, what brings us together, what explains our history as a nation, what explains our history with Indigenous Australians. As you would imagine, at different levels, as children grow, learn and are more capable of critical assessment, they are asked to reflect on these things, to analyse them, to comment on them and to discuss these questions, which is exactly the kind of education I had as a child.As well as having a great state school education as a child, which challenged me to think about the great moral concepts of our age, I also had the benefit of a very rigorous grounding at Mitcham Baptist Church, which included endless committing to memory of catechism. I was a prizewinner at it, and it served me in good stead. I have been known to joke with the Leader of the Opposition in the past that one day we will go head to head on our ability to recite sections of the Bible by rote. I think I could back myself in for some large slabs of it. - My point was simply this: with a great education, which includes developing your critical faculties as well your understanding of moral concepts, you are equipped as an adult to make your own decisions. I have made mine, in good conscience as an adult. They are not the same as others in this place; that is to be expected. We live in a democracy which values free conscience and free thinking. That is the kind of education I want for Australian children. That is the kind of education I believe the national curriculum is aimed at.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for the question. Members might be aware that, as a result of decisions taken at the end of last week, the cattle that the Victorian government have sent into the Alpine National Park have to be out by 8 April. The very simple basis is that, unlike the views of the Liberal and National Party in Victoria, most Australians do not wander into our national parks and say, 'Oh, it's a pretty nice place. All it needs to improve it is some cattle.' The argument that came from the Victorian government was that somehow these cattle were required to reduce bushfire - notwithstanding that, of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission's 67 recommendations, seven dealt with land and fuel management and none of them suggested that cattle should be reintroduced. The member for Goldstein said, 'It's about our heritage,' wanting to refer to the Man from Snowy River. They were brought there in a truck! This was not the Man from Snowy River going up on horseback.The argument then came from the Victorian government that it was all about science, about so-called scientific grazing. In wanting to find out what the scientific research was about, we heard from a member of the Victorian parliament by the name of Donna Petrovich. She said that people in those areas have an intrinsic knowledge of their environment, and so do the livestock. She said, 'In many respects, we are quite lucky that there are still a few remaining lead cows in those herds that know the areas that are being trialled. If we did not have that, we would have an environmental problem. Those cattle stick to the areas and the tracks, and they teach the other cattle the appropriate way to move through that country.' So the line from the Victorian government is: 400 cattle walk into a national park; the calves want to go to the endangered wetlands; but the lead cow says, 'Oh no, that is listed under the EPBC Act. You can't go there.'Then we got the official information from the Victorian government, and it was no better. I asked the Victorian government to provide the Australian government with the documents that caused them to make a decision in January. They gave us a document dated March. For the reason that they made a decision in January, they gave us a document that was dated 15 March 2011. It provides the next layer of the scientific research. In year 1, the placement of cattle in the selected sites was required to enable the cattle to develop and demonstrate high site fidelity and site familiarisation with these sites. High-fidelity cattle is what this trial is allegedly going to provide us with! You can almost see JB Hi-Fi: you have got the high-fidelity speakers and the high-fidelity system; they can now introduce the cattle as well, courtesy of the Victorian government.We were promised that this would be a scientific university study, but it would not pass as high school science homework. We were promised that there would be science involved; the Victorian government have given us nothing but satire. Make no mistake: when you change the government from a Labor government to a coalition government, you get a worse environmental outcome.</DOC>

 - To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: no matter how ferocious the scare campaign, we will stay the course and we will get this done because it is the right thing to do by the country. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has only one speed as a politician and that is 'wreck'. Here he is in this parliament making figures up. What is remarkable to me is that some days the Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and criticises the government for not giving enough detail about carbon pricing and then on other days he comes into this parliament and makes figures up as though he can use those figures with any authority. You cannot have it both ways. - As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, this is a government committed to pricing carbon. That means we will make the biggest polluters pay and we will use the revenue that is paid by the big polluters to assist households, to assist businesses to make the transition and to tackle climate change programs.I understand that as the Leader of the Opposition goes around the country he is making people afraid. I am sure he went to that small business today for the sole purpose of making people afraid. But to the Leader of the Opposition I say this: we are a Labor government and we will deliver this change fairly. In the great tradition of reforming Labor governments we will get this done and we will get it done with fairness. I say to the Leader of the Opposition as well: I hope he took the opportunity during his travels to this small business today to say to every person that he met along the way that, if he is elected and we have provided tax cuts, he will take those tax cuts away; that, if he is elected and we have increased pensions, he will take those increases away; that, if we provide assistance through direct assistance to households and he is elected, he will take that assistance away.I think the Leader of the Opposition should be very clear with Australian families, after the announcement made by his shadow Treasurer yesterday: what he stands for is ripping money out of the purses and wallets of Australians which the government wants to provide. The government is committed to making the biggest polluters in this country pay and using that money to assist households, to assist businesses and to tackle climate change. The proposition is to tax polluters and help households. The Leader of the Opposition's proposition is to tax households and help polluters. That is what he stands for - taking money off decent hardworking Australians and giving it by way of subsidies to the biggest polluting businesses in this country. We will get this job done because it is right for the country, no matter how ferocious the Leader of the Opposition's scare campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and know he is guided in this place by serving the national interest. We had the opposition laugh at this question because this is an opposition that think the word 'reform' and the concept of reform are to be laughed at. That is their only contribution to the public debate. It was not always like this. The Liberal Party did not historically lie as low as it does today. Historically the big economic transformations in this country have had bipartisan support. That was true under the Hawke and Keating governments when major reforms like floating the dollar and reducing tariffs got strong bipartisan support.Of course, I was never a fan of former Prime Minister John Howard, but I do give him this: faced with the choice when he was in opposition of going and looking for fear or supporting economic reform in the nation's interest, he chose to support economic reform. Now, in the challenge that we face today, a challenge of pricing carbon, what do we see? Each and every day we see the Leader of the Opposition putting his political interest before the national interest. That is what he does every day that he comes into this place. He uses a scare campaign before even giving the matter any proper consideration or using his better judgment.Let us go through the examples. On national health reform, before I even announced the new national health reform agreement, the Leader of the Opposition was on people's TV screens, bagging it and saying it was wrong. He did not even bother to read it before saying no. On the National Broadband Network, the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly does not understand the power of this technology, before he bothered to inform himself about the economic benefits and the service benefits for Australians, just said no. On the flood levy - and it is a very important example today - when this government were working through how we would fund our commitment to rebuilding Queensland and rebuilding the nation, the Leader of the Opposition just said no. A levy was good enough for him to fund his election promises but it was not good enough for him to support the people of Queensland by supporting that levy.Now, in the tradition of those scare campaigns, we have the Leader of the Opposition trying to raise fear on pricing carbon. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will keep staring his fear campaign down. What the Leader of the Opposition needs to do is come clean on his attitude to climate change. He should stand before the Australian people and admit that he is a climate change denier. He should come before the Australian people and say that he has supported a carbon tax in the past and that the only reason he says no now is that he is motivated by the politics of the issue. And he should say to the Australian people that he stands for taking assistance out of their hands. If we provide tax cuts to assist, he will take them away. If we provide pension increases to assist, he will take them away. If we provide direct payments to assist, he will take them away. The Leader of the Opposition stands for taking money from Australian households. He should come very clean about that.</DOC>

 - The member who asked the question started her question with the word 'given' and then went on to say something to this parliament -  - You can always rely on the shadow Treasurer for a bit of help. I thank him for that; he is much more supportive of me than he is of the Leader of the Opposition and he is being very supportive now! I thank the shadow Treasurer for absolutely admitting to this House that the opposition is predicating its questions on figures that it is just grabbing - that, of course, it is coming into this parliament to raise fear and, in order to do that, it is making things up. The question asked by the member is just about making things up.What I would say to the member opposite is: how is she going to feel in the 2013 election campaign? How is she going to feel -  - Thank you very much. I say to the member who asked the question: how is she going to feel in the 2013 election campaign after this government has successfully priced carbon -  - Thank you very much. I say to the member, who continues to float figures that she has just made up: how will she feel at the next election campaign when we have successfully priced carbon through this parliament? How will she feel at the next election campaign, when she is honour bound to go to every constituent in her electorate and say, 'The assistance the Gillard government gave you, Tony Abbott wants back' - that, if we have provided tax cuts, those tax cuts will be taken away and that, if we have provided pension increases, those pension increases will be taken away. - I say to the member as well: how will she feel in her electorate of Macquarie, saying that her political party is led by a climate change denier and that she stands for no effective action on climate change? - On the question of the opposition's determination to repeal compensation, let me take the House to some very relevant facts -  - I simply say to the House that, actually having come to this flashpoint, I would hope that members take a deep breath and behave in a manner that those who observe us from outside would expect. That would apply to both sides - actually turning down the heat and returning to the basics of what we are here for: that is, to debate the issues and not get into the personality clashes that we have seen over many question times. I conclude, regrettably, that we are judged on this hour and a half of our proceedings, and not on the cooperation that is seen about issues that are myriad - including the sensitive issue that I am being lectured upon by a member. The Prime Minister has the call. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I simply refer the House to the Leader of the Opposition's many past and completely contradictory statements on the question of accepting the climate change science. I also refer the House to the shadow Treasurer's words from yesterday - facts that the member for Macquarie may be interested in, facts on Sky Agenda, where he was asked by the host, 'You'll repeal the compensation?' to which the shadow Treasurer said, 'Of course.' That is why I am putting to the member for Macquarie that, if we give tax cuts, you are committed to taking them away; if we give pension increases, you are committed to taking them away; and if we give direct payments then the Leader of the Opposition has committed you to taking them away. Be honest about that with your electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She is right. It would certainly be better if we saw bipartisan support for the major reform that lies in front of this nation. It would be better if the opposition had not given way to denial of the science of climate change. It would be better if the Liberal Party had not turned its back on its traditions and denied the power of markets. It would be better if the Liberal Party accepted what I believe it would have accepted at any other point in its history, which is that it is not right to take money from taxpayers and use that as a subsidy for big polluters, which is what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. It would be better if this major transformation of our economy so we can be a prosperous nation in the future and so we can make our contribution to combating climate change - this big reform - had bipartisan support.Of course, pricing carbon has had support from time to time before they gave way to being in perpetual scare campaign mode and standing for absolutely nothing except raising fear in the community. The government is committed to pricing carbon. We are committed to doing that because I do not want this nation left behind. I want us to invest in a clean energy future. We have to make a start because the rest of the world is moving. We have a high-pollution economy and we cannot afford to be left behind. We need to start to have our economy transition.Yes, this is going to be a difficult process of reform; I absolutely accept that. But it is a reform the government is determined to lead notwithstanding the fear campaign and scare campaign coming from the opposition. I take the House to the following words - it would be better if the opposition remembered some of these words:Despite an initial protest from industries taxed not only have they survived but many have flourished because the cleaner industry has often proved to be more efficient. - These words were from an opposition member: 'Pollution taxes encourage companies to decrease discharges of pollutants to the extent that it is less costly to treat waste than to meet the tax bill.' He said these words: 'Producers have responded to the tax in two ways. First, they have switched to less polluting production processes. Secondly, they have developed new technology to minimise waste created by existing production processes.' There we go. We have those wise words and the member for Flinders owning up to them. No, it was not the member for Wentworth who said that. It was not the member for North Sydney. It was the member for Flinders in his 1990 thesis. We know, of course, that then he was a believer in dealing with climate change. We know that he then endorsed carbon pricing.The truth is that many thinking members of the Liberal Party still do. I appeal to them to be their best. I appeal to them to walk in the reform tradition of the Liberal Party. I appeal to them not to give way to this fear and climate change scepticism and denial. I appeal to them to maintain the historic mission of the Liberal Party: understanding the power of markets. What that means is that they will not be able to follow this man any longer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course, we have been through these debates before. When we were reducing tariffs there were plenty of people who said, 'Don't do that until the rest of the world has done it,' and fear was raised about the reduction of tariffs. What has been the outcome of that major economic reform? A more prosperous country that is more resilient to economic shocks, including the global financial crisis; more people in work; and a country that is making its way in the world. But on any day when we were involved in that major economic debate people said that we should not do those things; we should not reform our economy until the rest of the world had acted. To the great credit of the Liberal Party then it believed in economic reform. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party no longer believes in reform of anything. It no longer believes in putting the national interest in front of its political interest.The answer to the honourable member's question is that the rest of the world is moving. President Obama committed to 80 per cent of energy coming from clean energy sources by 2035. China is acting on climate change by closing small, inefficient, dirty power stations and replacing them with bigger, more economically efficient and environmentally friendly ones. China is making new commitments to climate change and to reducing greenhouse gases, including commitments to reducing its carbon emissions per unit of GDP. India is taxing coal from all sources in order to fund clean energy initiatives. India will in April move to an energy credits trading scheme.These are the things that are happening around our world. Here we are in Australia with per capita the highest carbon polluting economy in the developed world. That means that the journey of transition that we need to make is a bigger journey. It is in our national interest. - I was asked by the member for Goldstein if it was in Australia's national interest to act. The answer I am giving leads to one conclusion: unambiguously yes. If you want a prosperous country in the future then you are for carbon pricing. If you want to make a difference to climate change and to the degree of carbon pollution emissions in our economy then you are for carbon pricing. If you do not care about jobs, if you do not care about the challenges of the future and if you do not care about the environment then you stick with your scare campaign. We know that the opposition do not care about any of them. The Leader of the Opposition does not care about the prosperity of this country and the future. The Leader of the Opposition does not care about doing the right thing by our environment. That is why, when faced with the choice to act in the national interest, we got this tawdry political display instead.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Kennedy for his question. The member for Kennedy raises an issue that he has championed long in this House - the importance and possibility for agricultural growth in the north of Australia. It is true that there are extraordinary quantities of water available in the north and, unless mechanisms are found to be able to better harvest that water, the communities there will not be able to fully take advantage of that. When the Northern task force reported - I think it was a couple of years ago now - I was asked a question about the possibilities here, and on behalf of the government I reaffirmed that there is no government policy against the building of weirs or dams and that these were issues that we were very happy to look at.Some of the work that is relevant to what the member has asked goes to the Northern Australia Sustainable Futures Program. It is worth $6 million. It builds on existing government programs to advance the economic, social and cultural interests of people living in the north. Because there are so many different departments and agencies involved, there is now a new Northern Australia Ministerial Forum, which had its inaugural meeting on 13 December last year. I am advised it was highly successful in facilitating genuinely collaborative action in Northern Australia.The question also goes to what work is being done purely within government, here, in getting the various agencies in the Commonwealth government to better align to make sure that these programs and possibilities for Northern Australian can finally be brought together. As the member for Kennedy notes, we are not necessarily talking about massive projects but, in terms of the impact on those towns, a very substantial difference in employment prospects and for the future of those areas.On the working group to which you referred, I am advised that, with the approval of the Prime Minister, a working group is being established which will be convened under Minister Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The Minister will be well placed to bring together the key elements of reconstruction following Cyclone Yasi as well as more broadly ensuring that there is a long-term plan for agriculture in Northern Australia.The working group will look at resourced development in the five towns of the Queensland Gulf and Midwest in harvesting local water and inland resources. There is no doubt that throughout Australia there are opportunities to better use and more effectively use the water that we have. On many occasions, I have referred to the ambitions the government has within the Murray-Darling, of making sure that we can get healthy rivers, strong communities and sustainable food production. Those same three principles can just as easily be levelled towards the opportunities for Northern Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for a very important question because the government, unlike the opposition, believes that climate change is real and that we do need to transform our economy. But this is a very big reform for our economy, a very big structural reform. One of the reasons Australia has had 20 years of continuous growth is past governments and members of this House have signed up to fundamental market based reforms, which have given us a strength and resilience that have served us well and that have given us 20 continuous years of growth. This is a reform that we must embark on to ensure that we have another 20 years of continuous growth and do not fall behind the rest of the world. That is why economists like Nichols Stern and Ross Garnaut are telling us that there is a fundamental problem here that must be fixed. The problem is that the largest polluters just continue to pump pollution into the atmosphere, and that has cost. It has cost to the environment, it has cost to the community and it has cost to our economy. That is why we must have a market based approach to deal with it. We need to give the largest polluters the incentive to reduce carbon pollution and that is what we have to do. That is why we describe this as a fundamental market based reform. Of course, we are not alone in this view. That is what the Treasury believes we must do. That is what the Productivity Commission believes we must do. It is what the OECD believes we must do. But all the oddballs on the other side of the House are now in climate change denial. - It has become very clear in the House today that there are many on that side of the House who are climate change sceptics. -  - The point I was making was that those opposite do not believe in the power of markets any more. This is a fundamental point. Nor do they apparently believe in the science of climate change. That is a powerful, destructive combination. Not believing in climate change, not believing in global warming and not believing in markets makes them almost the equivalent to the central planners of Russia, decades ago. - They are in denial all of the time about the basic facts, not believing in the basic science and not believing in the basic economics. About 18 months ago some of them did believe in the power of markets, the power of markets to deal with carbon pollution. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say to David Uren and Lenore Taylor, in 2010:I was acting industry minister in 2002 when Peter Costello, David Kemp and I argued _ in the Howard cabinet that we should have an ETS.He then went on to say - I believe the market mechanism is the best way to price a commodity.That is what the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, believed in 2002. That is what he told a couple of prominent authors in their book about the power of markets and where the view was in the Howard cabinet. It is not the view now. That is why I do describe them - like the British conservative politician did - as oddballs, because they do not believe in the power of markets and they do not believe in the science of climate change. I can see the member for Wentworth over there somewhat embarrassed by the company that he now keeps. The shadow Treasurer has had more positions on climate change than hot dinners and there are plenty of others on that side of the House that fit into the same category. We on this side of the House approach this fundamental -

 - I thank the member for her question. I am aware of media references to the supposed impact of a carbon price on BlueScope. I am aware of that. The government is aware of the issues confronting BlueScope and will continue to consult with them about the introduction of a carbon price.BlueScope and the broader steel industry were heavily consulted during the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme debate regarding assistance for emissions-intensive, trade exposed industries. Our commitment is to consult with the steel industry. Our commitment is to consult with businesses. We have a business round table for that purpose and, of course, we have a broader outreach than that. As we engage in that broader outreach, let me explain to the member that, with the carbon price mechanism we have announced, we will be putting a price on carbon and we will be getting the biggest polluters in this country to pay that price. That is because we want to cut carbon pollution. At the moment they can put that carbon pollution into the atmosphere for nothing. We will put a price on it. That will drive innovation and change. Then the money raised through that will be used to compensate households. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was making a point about the use of the revenue raised by putting a price on pollution, paid by the biggest polluters. We have already canvassed in question time today the use of that revenue, and it will be our single highest priority to assist Australian households. That is the assistance that the opposition is opposed to and would take away.The second use of that revenue will be to assist Australian industry. We understand that there is a transition that needs to be made here, and we will be supporting Australian industry in that transition. That is because I believe that we need to act to make sure that our economy has prosperity in the future. We want to protect Australian jobs. We want to make sure Australia has the clean-energy jobs of the future. That is why we need to price carbon.The third use of the revenue raised by putting a price on pollution, which will cut pollution, will be to fund programs to tackle climate change. On the direct engagement of BlueScope, can I say to the member who has asked the question: I referred a little earlier in my answer to the business round table that is continuing to meet and provide feedback to government. BlueScope is represented on that round table. Paul O'Malley was in attendance when the round table met in November and in February. We will continue to have that round table meet to provide assistance to government in the further design of the carbon pricing scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question, because he has had a long and continuing interest in climate change policy. Climate scientists are telling governments all around the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The scientific advisor to the government's Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the well-recognised scientist, Professor Will Steffen of the ANU, has indicated to the committee that there is 100 per cent certainty that temperatures are increasing globally and that there is 95 per cent certainty that human activity through carbon emissions is contributing to those increased temperatures. Of course, 2010 was the equal warmest year on record and the period 2000-10 was the warmest decade on record. The scientific evidence is very clear - and it is advice that it has been provided to all governments internationally. But not everyone in this House seems to agree. Eighteen months ago the Leader of the Opposition said: 'We can't conclusively say whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to climate change.' - The Leader of the Opposition also infamously said that climate change is absolute crap. -  - The point is that these views contradict all mainstream scientific opinion. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not want to be seen as an extremist or a denier these days. He is trying to invite a cloak of respectability. - I was asked whether there was a credible scientific basis for not taking action on climate change. Of course, when you stop denying the climate science, we will stop calling you a denier. That is the fact of the matter. -  - The Leader of the Opposition has occasionally tried to suggest that he respects the science. Apparently, he has instructed the shadow cabinet to keep the debate away from climate science so that they can focus on their scare campaign tactics. He could not even follow his own advice.</DOC>

I found this article from 20 May 1990, 'A tax to make the polluter pay,' by Greg Hunt and Rufus Black. It made very interesting reading. In responding to this question from the member for Flinders, I want to let him know that I tracked down that article from 20 May 1990 because he cited it as a source in his thesis, would you believe? 'Hunt on Hunt' - that is how he sourced his thesis. - I am giving you a commercial. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was talking him up and I will stop doing that right now. On the question of the advertising campaign that the member for Flinders has asked me about, can I just say the following to him: the government is not ruling any options out; however, at this point the government has taken no decisions on advertising. The department is examining a number of options for public communications and this involves contact with public relations agencies, as is standard practice.</DOC>

 - The debate about a price on carbon is a complex and difficult economic debate. As minister for energy, I know that better than most in the House. When you look at the fundamentals of the Australian economy, a highly efficient market energy driven system has been the key to the Australian economy. The Australian energy market is actually held up as the most efficient in the OECD world. That goes to a key issue which has to be resolved: our responsibility as a community to debate and finalise the debate about how we put in place once and for all a price on carbon. That goes to the question of certainty. At the moment, the Commonwealth parliament is not responsible for the substantial increases in the price of electricity. There are quite substantial price increases going through the system, because of the need to invest in distribution and transmission. But our problem is that the CEOs in the energy sector have outstanding investments of many billions of dollars going to the question of additional capacity from the point of view of electricity generation.When we talk about this additional capacity, let us deal with a few facts, because these are the problems that confront us as a community from an economic point of view at the moment, because of our lack of certainty with respect to where we go on a price on carbon. Firstly, it is estimated that over $17 billion of capital is required for power generation assets - that is, refinancing, capital expenditure and new build over the next five years. Secondly, and importantly, it is estimated that $6.4 billion of that $17 billion has to be refinanced for existing generation prior to the end of 2012. That is why Brad Page, CEO of the Energy Supply Association of Australia recently said on ABC. He said, 'We are not talking about short-term investments. We are talking about investments made by the sector that really last for 40 or 50 years and we need stable policy.'With respect to some of these investments, these decisions have to be made in the next two or three years. That is complex at the best of times, because it goes to difficult issues going to environment or regulatory approvals. But, before we can even get to that point, to be able to bank these investments we have to know what the investment horizons are from the point of view of what is a price on carbon. If we do not get this right, then for the first time ever the Australian community will turn its sights on the Commonwealth parliament, because we will be the ones correctly held responsible for failing to guarantee the reliability of the Australian electricity sector. Historically, it has been a state and territory responsibility. If you have any doubts about that from a political point of view of potency, have a look historically at what happens to state and territory governments of all political persuasions when the lights go out. They are held responsible and they soon disappear from office. So I simply say, in conclusion, that the time has come for us to finalise this debate so as to maintain Australia's energy security and reliability and to ensure that the economic vandalism - which the other side of the House will be responsible for, for not allowing us to finalise this once and for all - is overcome.</DOC>

 - I thank Member for Page for her question. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who just said we have moved off carbon, she understands that transport and infrastructure is a part of dealing with reducing our carbon emissions, which is precisely what the question was about. We on this side, because we are not sceptics and deniers, believe in action, and we believe in action across government. We know that one tonne of freight carried on rail only generates one-third of the carbon emissions generated by freight carried on road. We have invested $3.4 billion in the interstate rail network over six years, part of our whole-of-government approach to reducing carbon emissions. Compared to our predecessors, that is twice as much investment in half the time. Each 1,500-metre train equals 100 trucks - that is, 100 trucks off the road, resulting in less congestion on our roads and fewer carbon emissions in the air.Last week on the North Coast of New South Wales we saw another major milestone in this most extensive upgrade to the nation's freight rail network in almost a century. Last week we began work at Casino on straightening the main north-south line between Newcastle and the Queensland border. This project will take eight months. It will reduce the severity of the curves at some 58 separate locations by realigning the existing track, and this move alone will cut rail transit times across the seaboard by an hour.Under the Howard government, the proportion of freight carried by rail between Sydney and Brisbane actually fell from 24 per cent to 19 per cent. We are determined to reverse that decline. That is why we have a draft national freight strategy out there. That is why we have a national ports strategy integrating land transport with our port system. This is investment in critical economic infrastructure. It will strengthen our economy and help secure our future and, in the meantime, it has created 2,000 construction jobs in the sector as well as supporting jobs in manufacturing at factories including those at Grafton in the electorate of the honourable Member for Page. This is good for business, good for productivity and good for reducing our emissions.</DOC>

 - We have questions based on chain emails, by the sound of it. I thank the shadow minister for immigration for his question. I can advise him of the following. The security assessment process that we do for people whose applications are being processed is, of course, an important part of our border security regime. We, as a government that has deployed more assets patrolling our border than ever before, will of course not be compromising on this very important part of our border security regime.I understand that floating out there are some chain emails and the like, but the facts are these. There has been no deal in regard to security assessments - that is completely untrue. You may have picked that up from an email sent to you, but it is untrue. Over recent months there has been ongoing collaboration between the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the immigration department to streamline security checking arrangements to reduce processing times without compromising national security. That means that, for most existing cases, security checking for people whose claims have now been accepted will be completed progressively by the end of April. As you would expect, in some individual cases, completing security assessments will take more time. That is important for Australia's national security and important for the protection of the Australian community, and of course the time necessary will be taken to do those security assessments. That is the answer to the member's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. A carbon price will, of course, be paid by the large polluters in our economy for every tonne of pollution that they omit. The number of companies that will be liable under a carbon price mechanism will be less than 1,000. Importantly, every dollar raised from the large polluters in our economy will be used to assist low- and middle-income households to support jobs in the most affected industries and to tackle climate change. The assistance that the government will provide will pay particular attention to pensioners and low-income households. That is because we are a Labor government and we look after people who need help the most.Yesterday, the shadow Treasurer confirmed that, if the coalition are elected, the coalition will abolish any assistance Labor provides to households. If they are elected, the Liberals will reach into the pockets of pensioners and low-income households and families and abolish any assistance -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker; I certainly am conscious of that issue. I was asked about what impact a rollback of the carbon price would have on the assistance provided to family budgets of low- and middle-income earners. As the Prime Minister made the point earlier, if we take the commitment that was made by the shadow Treasurer yesterday on behalf of the coalition to withdraw any assistance provided, if that assistance is provided in the form of tax cuts, the coalition is going to increase taxes. If that assistance is provided in the form of a pension increase, the coalition is going to cut pensions. If it is provided in the form of an improved family tax benefit, the coalition is going to cut the family tax benefit.We all know the truth about all of this: the coalition does not care about the pressure that households are under. Why would they take the assistance away? - The fact of the matter is that, by withdrawing this assistance by potentially increasing taxes and cutting pensions, the coalition need that money to fund their subsidy scheme for large polluters. What we have is a very clear choice in politics: a carbon price paid by the large polluters, the revenue from which can be dispersed partly to support households, pensioners and low- and middle-income households in particular; or, alternatively, we have a slug to taxpayers to the worth of $30 billion, the equivalent of $720 a year for an average household - that is what their policy means - in order to pay that money as a subsidy to hand-picked large polluters. That is the contrast in politics at this point in time. It highlights the reason why the use of a market mechanism is extremely important in pricing carbon in our economy.This is what former Prime Minister John Howard had to say at the Melbourne Press Club on 17 July 2007 in relation to this specific issue of the use of market mechanisms. He said, in relation to people who will not respect the market:They are the real climate change deniers because they deny _ rational, realistic and sustainable policy solutions.He went on to say:The moralising tone of utopian internationalism is also not helpful. Institutions will only work and endure if they harness national interests.

 - I thank the member for Gippsland for his question. I think the member for Gippsland refers to two reports in today's media. One was an Australian Federal Police report, looking at the added managed security at the North West Point Detention Centre. That report made nine recommendations and my advice is that all nine recommendations were adopted. That report also dealt with the potential for a detention centre capacity of 2,300, which was substantially more than the detention centre capacity at North West Point at the time of last week's riot. I think that the honourable member is also referring to a report from a manager of Serco in relation to staffing at the North West Point Detention Centre. Both of these reports and any other reports that were provided by the department are matters for investigation by the independent review that I have established. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The honourable member asked me about reports and I am referring to the two reports that I am aware of. These reports and other reports will be referred to the independent investigation that I initiated, the independent investigation which will be led by two eminent former bureaucrats, Dr Allan Hawke and Ms Helen Williams. I would invite the honourable member to share any information he has with that review.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It was a great pleasure to be in his electorate with the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing just a fortnight ago announcing the details of the implementation plans resulting from health reform in South Australia. It was very good news in South Australia that, of the 179 sub-acute beds that are being provided, 159 of them are mental health beds that will be provided across South Australia. There are also upgrades to Modbury Hospital in the electorate of Makin and the Women's and Children's Hospital in the electorate of Adelaide. But even some of those opposite who are interjecting might be interested to know that there are investments at the Repatriation General Hospital in the electorate of Boothby, investments in Whyalla in the electorate of Grey, Mount Gambier in the electorate of Barker -  - Each of those electorates is receiving 20 extra beds. Those who are interjecting need to understand that they are not on the record as indicating whether they support a single cent of those investments that are being rolled out across the country. In New South Wales, for example, there are already 300 beds that are open due to health reform - 18 at Blacktown Hospital, 45 at Westmead Hospital, 21 in Wollongong Hospital - and those opposite have never told the public whether they support our investments in those facilities.Last week I was in the electorate of the Minister for Trade announcing $175 million boost to the Logan Hospital that will add 50 more beds and triple the capital works upgrade at the hospital. Similarly, the member for Moreton and I announced a doubling in the size of the emergency department at the QE2 hospital with more help for Brisbane South families.Interestingly, as we get on with the business of health reform, we have also been moving legislation through this parliament. Yesterday the first piece of significant health reform legislation passed in parliament. It was opposed in this House by the Liberal Party. It was opposed in the Senate and again in the House yesterday and, ironically, the opposition led by Mr Abbott actually has opposed legislation that is permanently establishing a body that the Leader of the Opposition established temporarily when he was the health minister. I make this point because it seems that, whether it is carbon, health reform, or whether it is a rolled-gold, rock-solid guarantee, the Leader of the Opposition changes his mind from day to day. He is not just a weathervane on carbon; he cannot make up his mind what he wants to do on health. He has been inconsistent, uncertain and just downright weird. Listen to what the Leader of the Opposition said when he introduced and established the Safety and Quality Commission. -  - I want to quote to the House the comments from the member for Warringah in 2005 when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing in the days when he supported the need for a safety and quality commission. He said:_ a national safety and quality commission will make it more important for doctors to have comprehensive records, access to the best possible information retrieval systems, and useable checklists against avoidable mistakes.Apparently these are now good and important changes for the health system that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party no longer support because they are inconsistent and uncertain about every possible policy issue we are debating in this parliament. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of attending the rally outside Parliament House today, I am not aware that I was invited. But, as I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition did not lack for red-headed company at that rally. He had a red-headed friend out at that rally, so I am sure he would not have missed me.Let me turn to the substantive question that he has asked me about talking to the Australian people and campaigning for climate change action. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have forgotten that he sat in the Howard cabinet for years - a truly remarkable feat - and that he used to claim the Prime Minister as his political mentor. He sat in that cabinet day after day making decisions for the Howard government. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that amongst the decisions the Howard government made was their decision to go to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme. The Labor Party also went to the 2007 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme and we went to the 2010 election arguing for an emissions trading scheme. - We understand that the Leader of the Opposition wants to continue his scare campaigns. He only knows one thing, which is to scare people, to try to make them afraid, and to deny the future. He has no positive policies and plans. What is remarkable is not his hollowness, because that is well-known; what is remarkable is that he would march away from the legacy of the Howard government at such a speed - march away from Prime Minister Howard's commitments to an emissions trading scheme and march away from the Liberal Party philosophy about the power of the markets.The Leader of the Opposition may be stuck in this denial and in his inability to make up a policy for the nation's future, but we are not. We will get on with the job of leading this nation to a clean energy future. If you care about the jobs of the future, you want to price carbon. If you care about the environment, you want to price carbon. That is precisely what we will do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her wonderfully perceptive question, because her question actually captures the major issue before this parliament today. I know the member for Petrie is someone who is in touch with her community and is out there having the real discussions with her community about this nation's future, including the need to tackle climate change and to price carbon. As she does that, I know that she says to people in her community, in the wonderful state of Queensland, that we are a nation blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy. -  The members for Dawson, Riverina, Braddon and Wakefield then left the chamber.  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was pointing to the fact that our nation is blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy - wind, geothermal and solar. We have abundant sources. If we look at solar energy, we have more solar radiation per square metre than any other continent in the world. In fact, we could power our country 500 times over if we were able to capture all of the solar energy in places where we could reasonably install solar panels. And if we used just one per cent of our estimated geothermal energy, we could supply roughly 25,000 times our energy consumption. These are great possibilities for our nation and great possibilities for its future. But, in order to realise those great possibilities, we need to get on with the job of pricing carbon. - I am asked about a national debate - a national debate between fear and facts -  - a national debate about pricing carbon and ensuring we do the right thing by our environment. I would like to remind people of some moments in that national debate. I have here the Liberal Party climate change policy from 1990. It has got Andrew Peacock on it, as of course it would, as he was the leader at the time. We all know that a souffle does not rise twice, but Mr Peacock did want to do something about rising greenhouse gases. And here we have his policy: a target to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 20 per cent by the year 2000 - a more progressive man in 1990 than the Leader of the Opposition is today. When you look at the election policy, you see that he was arguing for a tax review to promote sound environmental practices in industry and he said that he would never resile from a willingness to act in the genuine national interest wherever that is required.The history of Liberal engagement with this question goes on. Here is the environment policy from the days of John Hewson and Fightback. As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition wrote Fightback. Maybe he wrote this as well: 'a better environment and jobs' - their policy. This says: 'Where possible, the coalition will look for market solutions to environmental problems. We will use market forces and realistic pricing mechanisms as the primary means of regulation.' That is something the Liberal Party no longer believes in.Then, from the 2007 election, we have all of these documents, with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello committing the Liberal Party to action on climate change and an emissions trading scheme. Those were the days when the Liberal Party bothered to deal with facts. Now they have succumbed to this low point under the Leader of the Opposition, where all they deal in is fear. Does the Leader of the Opposition remember those days?

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and let me advise him: I make my own decisions. I make my own decisions based on my convictions. When I work through policies for the government, I rely on facts. So how have I formed my view about climate change? Let me be very clear. I looked to the scientific community for what the scientific consensus was. I dealt with facts, not fear. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is in a flirtation with climate change denial. I have looked at the facts and at the science. I formed the view that we need to act. I have accepted economic advice from around the world - the same economic advice the member for Flinders accepted when he wrote his thesis and the same advice former Prime Minister Howard accepted when he released these documents and when the current Leader of the Opposition was in his cabinet. That advice was that the best way of acting on carbon pollution was to harness the power of the market and to have an emissions trading scheme.I remind the House that in 2007 Prime Minister Howard actually went to the election promising 'the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world'. Post the 2010 election, we work in the parliament the Australian people voted for. In this parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, we work with others to secure reforms in the national interest. I formed the view, working with the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and understanding the views of members who are represented on that committee, including the Australian Greens, Mr Windsor and Mr Oakshott, that the best way of securing reform in this parliament, the way forward, was to bring a carbon pricing mechanism to the parliament, and I announced that carbon pricing mechanism. I had a choice between acting and not acting. I had a choice between acting in the national interest and failing to do so. I had a choice between accepting the science and engaging in denial. I had a choice between accepting quality economic advice and rejecting that advice. On every occasion, I made a choice to act - to accept the science, to accept the economic advice, and to work with this parliament to bring carbon pricing to this parliament.Unfortunately, at every point the Leader of the Opposition has made a different choice: to flirt with climate change denial, to reject economic advice and the power of the markets, to turn his back on 20 years of Liberal engagement with reducing carbon pollution - most recently Prime Minister Howard's promise to enact the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world. In making that choice, the Leader of the Opposition was guided every step of the way by his political interest. He thinks it is in his political interest to be out there raising fear and scaring the community. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on every judgment call he has needed to make in the nation's interest on the question of climate change, he has called wrong. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition too that the Australian community will hold him to account for that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for this very important question because putting a price on carbon is the right thing to do for Australia. It is not an easy thing to do. There are no soft options and of course there are no cost-free options, but it is the right thing to do not just for the future of our country but also for the future of our economy.There are diverse views in the community, and we welcome a full debate about global warming and what must be done about it. We welcome a frank debate, but that debate must be based on facts, not on fear. The behaviour that we have seen from the opposition, and particularly the opposition leader, today is that he is moving over to the fringe. He is moving over to the fear side of the argument and he does not want to confront the facts.Yesterday he took offence in this House at being called a climate change denier. But out there today he was addressing a climate sceptics rally. Yesterday he was claiming he was somehow a believer in action on global warming but today he is out there addressing a rally of climate change sceptics.I would like to quote from the website used by the group that was out the front of parliament today. Fair enough: they should be out expressing their opinions. I do not contest that for a moment. This is a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about ideas. It should be a debate about fact. But this is what the website that is used by those who were outside parliament today says - and everybody should listen very carefully:CO2 is not pollution and does not need to be reduced in the first place _It then goes on to say:Any warming from CO2 is likely to be harmless.He was out there today addressing a rally of climate change sceptics. Yesterday he took offence about being called a climate change denier. How can he have any credibility in here when he says he believes in dealing with global warming and goes out and addresses a rally of people who do not believe in dealing with global warming? How can he have any crediblity at all? He comes into this House and says he is a believer in markets and then he puts forward some Russian-style scheme to deal with changes in the environment. - I am being directly relevant to the question. I was asked about views which have been expressed, because views have been expressed in this House by the Leader of the Opposition that they are concerned about the cost of living. Now we hear they want to rip that cost of living out, and we have had the most extraordinary article today in the Sydney Morning Herald by Lenore Taylor and Phillip Coorey where they get the yarn where they were in fact instructed in the shadow cabinet not to tell anybody they had taken a decision to rip out household assistance, should it be provided. These double standards are absolutely extraordinary. But poor old Joe let the cat out of the bag. The coffee was barely warm in the shadow cabinet before he got on the agenda and told the truth. - It is one thing to be a climate change denier, if you are not wise or do not understand the science; it is entirely another thing to know the science and then go out and deny it. That is what we are getting from members opposite, including the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, because their motivation is so low. They actually do know the science, but they deliberately ignore it and go out and run a fear campaign about something that is so important to our future -

 - I thank the member for her question. What I said yesterday to the parliament was accurate, and let me add to it today. Let me inform the member who asked the question that in 2009, for the second year in a row, both the US and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, than from conventional sources. Let me also advise the member that renewables account for 60 per cent of newly installed capacity in Europe and more than 50 per cent in the US. At the same time, let me inform the member that China surpassed the US as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy. - Let's just go through that sentence again because the member was yelling instead of listening. She pretends an interest in this question, but she is really just on the fear campaign. Let's just go through that very slowly for her again. China surpassed the US as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy. Let's just have a think about what that means for the future of the global economy and the economy of our region. We have the giant economy of China investing at that rate in clean energy, more than the United States. What should that imply to the member for Indi if she really stopped and thought about it? It should imply that China is making those investments for a purpose. It is making those investments because it too wants to tackle climate change. It should imply to the member for Indi that there will be huge economic possibilities for our nation as China invests. If we research and develop and are at the forefront, the cutting edge of this technology, imagine the wealth that could be generated. If we are there as a clean energy nation ourselves, able to export technologies and knowledge to a giant like China, imagine the wealth.Of course, the member for Indi sits there and shakes her head because she is not interested in the facts and she is not interested in imagining the possibilities of the future. Let me say to the member for Indi: our future as a nation will be made by being a cleaner energy economy. We cannot afford to be left behind as giants like China and the US and the countries of Europe change and move. We cannot afford to be left behind. Prime Minister Howard understood this; Treasurer Peter Costello understood this.The member who asked the question campaigned in the 2007 election on the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. She was re-elected in this parliament in 2007 on the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. I say to the members of the Liberal Party who are truly ashamed of this fear campaign, who are truly ashamed of how low the Liberal Party has fallen under this Leader of the Opposition: it is time for them to assert themselves and say unambiguously that they believe in the climate change science -  - they believe in pricing carbon, they believe in what Prime Minister Howard promised in 2007 and they are prepared to work with the government in the national interest to create that clean energy economy of the future and get this done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know he shares the concern with many members in this chamber of the scourge of petrol sniffing on Aboriginal communities across this country and the dramatic impact it has on young people in particular. My own involvement with this terrible issue goes back three decades, when I was involved in helping to set up a petrol-sniffing program in the Central Desert lands of Pitjantjatjara country in 1980 and 1981. So I share his concern and understand the dramatic implications of petrol sniffing.I informed the House when the member last asked me a question that the Commonwealth had committed $84 million to the rollout of Opal over the next four years. I indicated then that we had problems in rolling it out in the goldfields region because of infrastructure issues. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, after consultation with BP Australia, those infrastructure issues have been overcome and that, as of 21 March, a communication strategy was entered into in the goldfields region to inform people about the arrival of Opal and that Opal would start to be delivered in the goldfields as at 31 March. It will be rolled out progressively over two months, and I expect that we will see many of the petrol stations in the region delivering Opal to consumers over that period.I say to the member that, since we last spoke about this, BP has had Opal independently tested and evaluated by, I think, Orbital in Western Australia. Their conclusion is that this fuel is as good if not better than other unleaded fuels. There will be no harm to small boat motors, to lawnmowers or to cars as a result of the use of this fuel, and those people in the community who are concerned about its impact upon their vehicles ought to understand that this is a very good fuel that will not harm their vehicles. I know that the member is aware that there are some sceptics and deniers in his own community around the issue of Opal. They exist in the Northern Territory as well. I say to them: get your head out of the sand, get with the game and buy Opal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know that he wants to see the people of his electorate live in a prosperous country with the jobs of the future. Ultimately, when you strip it all down and look at the debate about carbon pricing and climate change, where does it lead you? It leads you to whether you believe in facts or whether you believe in scaremongering; to whether you believe in hope or whether you believe in peddling fear. It also comes down to whether or not you are optimistic about the talents and capacities of the Australian people to adapt and to change and to lead that change or whether you are a pessimist, as the Leader of the Opposition is. The Leader of the Opposition believes the Australian people are not up to change. He actually must believe that the Australian people are not up to much. But the history of economic transformation in our country tells us to be optimistic about the Australian people and their talents and capacities. We have innovated before and we will innovate again. I am an optimist about this nation's future. The best days lie in front of us, not behind us.I know that on that side of the parliament they are mired in pessimism. They do not have faith in the Australian people - they do not have faith in their capacity for change. I have seen two things in the last week which have reinforced my hope and optimism in the creativity of the Australian people. I visited the Australian Solar Institute laboratories at the Australian National University. They are there at the cutting edge of research and development into solar technology. It is the kind of place that will lead to new technology, new innovations and great wealth for this country as the world moves to a cleaner energy future. This morning I went to the Capital wind farm at Bungendore, where I saw renewable energy technology operating and providing electricity and energy for our nation. I saw that happening. I met with two young people - two apprentices who are the first to do their apprenticeship at a wind farm. They are at the cutting edge themselves. Their names were Mark and Louie. Mark is from my electorate - he is from Diggers Rest - but he is there in Bungendore learning his trade on the energy of the future.The opposition would have you believe that these innovations do not exist. They would have you believe that our researchers are not up to it. They would have you believe that our young people cannot adapt. These pessimistic beliefs are untrue. I have seen it with my own eyes this week, and we will see it every day in the future. What we will see with pricing carbon is that we will create an incentive for Australian businesses, Australian companies, Australian researchers and Australian designers to be there generating the clean energy of the future. This is a remarkable possibility for a creative, clever country. It is a remarkable possibility for a country with so many sources of clean energy. I am optimistic about that future, and I say to the Australian people: we should all be optimistic about the future and not give way to the denial, the fear and the pessimism about the future that the Leader of the Opposition peddles every day. We can do this. We will price carbon, and we will get those great clean energy opportunities in the days to come.

 - I thank the member for his question. I would want firstly to go specifically to BlueScope and then talk more broadly about protecting Australian jobs. Let me say specifically on BlueScope: inevitably, as we work out way through this carbon pricing debate, we will see claims and counterclaims in the media. I say to the member and to the Australian public generally that when they see those claims it would pay to run the fine-tooth comb over them so people have the accurate facts. I believe in people having the facts.So on BlueScope Steel let's go through those facts for the member. There was a report that BlueScope was planning to abandon building a $1billion cogeneration plant at its Port Kembla steelworks. That was reported in the newspaper. The fact is they cancelled that project prior to the carbon price announcement that was reported on 26 February. It is very important that people get the facts. And then, of course, on BlueScope Steel, because the member specifically asked me about BlueScope Steel, we did at an earlier time during debates about carbon pricing have BlueScope Steel saying that it was shelving a cogeneration plant because at that stage the carbon price had been deferred by a year. So, actually, they wanted the carbon price in order to understand the financial -  -  - No, I am putting that from the point of view of investment certainty. They wanted the certainty to feed into their investment decisions. In that regard I refer people to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 May 2009, which says:BLUESCOPE Steel's plan to build a $1 billion-plus co-generation plant to lower greenhouse gas emissions from its blast furnaces at Port Kembla has emerged as the first major casualty of the Federal Government's decision to delay the start of the proposed emissions trading scheme by at least a year.So what I would say to the member is that it does pay to run a fine-tooth comb over the series of claims which will inevitably be made publicly during the course of this debate. What I would then say to the member, broadly, on manufacturing jobs -  - Thank you very much. The last few words I said before I was interrupted were on the question of manufacturing jobs, about which the member asked me. Let me address that for the member. I understand and the government understands that we will need to take steps to assist industry to adjust. That is why when we announced the carbon price we said all of the revenue raised by putting a price on the 1,000 biggest polluters will be used to assist households - that is the assistance that the member is committed to ripping away - will be used to assist industry to adjust and will be used for programs to tackle climate change. I want to protect Australian jobs. I want us to have the clean energy jobs of the future. In order to ensure as we design the scheme that we hear the voice of business, we are working through a business roundtable as well as through direct consultations so that we can get the design right. We want to protect Australian jobs. That is what the industry assistance is about as part of this package to price carbon. If the member seriously wants to contribute to this debate then of course he would have to get his party to abandon climate change denial, price carbon and work with us on the details.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Chifley for his question. Since the government announced the carbon price framework several weeks ago there has of course been significant debate in relation to it. Today, for example, I was happy to receive a petition from the ACTU and the World Wildlife Fund on the need to take action on climate change. The petition was signed by over 12,000 people and called for the parliament to reduce carbon pollution and move to a clean energy future.Of course, there are those with opposing views, including those who are part of the so-called 'people's revolt' organised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is perfectly legitimate in a democracy for people to freely express their views and to engage in rallies such as that conducted today. I have been involved in some rallies myself over a period of time. It is appropriate, though, to consider just what organisations are becoming involved in the Leader of the Opposition's campaign against a carbon price and why they might oppose the government's climate change plans.The revolt is in fact led by the Menzies House website, which was founded with the help of Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, who is notorious for his climate change science denial. But there is also a range of other groups involved that do not like the government's climate change policy. The Consumers and Taxpayers Association, who organised today's rally, AAP noted a few weeks ago is an association with just three members. You have also got climate sceptics groups, the anti-Semitic Australian League of Rights, and One Nation. No surprise that they do like the government's policies. -  - One of the other groups protesting the government's climate change laws was - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is the first question he has actually asked me this week as the shadow minister for immigration, and I thank him for it. As I indicated yesterday to the honourable member for Gippsland, I am aware of two reports in relation to suggestions of violence on Christmas Island -  -  - The warnings are the two that I have referred to. Clearly, as I have said continuously, I have recognised for some time, since last September, that we needed to reduce pressure on the detention centre at Christmas Island. One of the reasons we needed to reduce the pressure on the detention centre at Christmas Island was the pressure that that created in relation to the management of the detention centre. I have made that clear. That is why I announced the mainland detention centres to relieve the pressure on Christmas Island. I did that in response to advice from my department that the pressure on Christmas Island should be reduced. I have done that, against the opposition of those members opposite, who said that those detention centres were not necessary.When a Minister is occasionally unable to provide an immediate substantive answer, he or she may either undertake to supply the Member with the requested information in writing at a later date _As the minister is unable to provide the answer, perhaps he could follow that. - As I said, I have responded very clearly to the situation on Christmas Island and have taken steps to reduce the pressure on the Christmas Island detention centre. I have done so in conjunction with the advice from my department that the numbers on Christmas Island would benefit from being reduced in relation to the opening of detention centres on the mainland, which the opposition opposed at every step. I have established an independent, arms-length inquiry, which I invite the honourable member for Cook to make a submission to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. While a lot of the focus of the debate has gone on preparing Australia's economy for the future through a lower emissions economy, we must not turn a blind eye to the environmental damage that is done through climate change itself. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projections of significant loss of biodiversity through to 2020. The impact of climate change is greatest on the most sensitive parts of our environment. Areas identified include the wet tropics, including the Daintree rainforest, our alpine regions and the Great Barrier Reef, which is our greatest environmental asset; a biodiversity asset which makes an extraordinary economic contribution to the tourism industry.One thing that puts us in a different situation to many nations when we talk about the environmental impact of climate change is the extraordinary number of species that are found on our continent and nowhere else on earth. Around 90 per cent of the species found in Australia, whether they be plants, mammals or reptiles, do not exist anywhere else on the planet. The impact environmentally on Australia is quite a different challenge to what we find in many other countries. While many of the mammals, for example, would be able to survive technically with what climate change itself would bring, their habitat would not. When endangered species lose their habitat, in turn we lose these species.The Great Barrier Reef and the extent of its biodiversity can easily be lost upon us, but let us start with just how different it is to other reef systems around the world. So often when people talk about the great reefs of the world they talk about the Caribbean. The Caribbean has 60 species of coral and the Great Barrier Reef has 560 species of coral. We have a very different biodiversity challenge to what is found in many other countries of the world.The climate change challenges faced by the Great Barrier Reef come in a number of ways. We know about the increased occurrence of bleaching events, the increase in major weather events and the impact of the growth in carbonic acid. We often talk about forests as being the only carbon sinks. The ocean itself is an extraordinary carbon sink. In the process of transferring carbon dioxide in the ocean you get a growth of carbonic acid. The growth of carbonic acid has a very precise impact on the rate at which coral grows back. If you put these three events together - the impact of bleaching events, the coral damaged during major weather events that are happening more regularly and coral species, which take 30 to 50 years to regrow, being slower to regrow because of the growth in carbonic acid - we will end up with a situation where the Great Barrier Reef itself exists but its biodiversity, which we are proud of and which we come to expect in the Great Barrier Reef, is under significant pressure.That is one of the reasons why action is so important not only in taking the opportunity now to set up our economy for the future but also in recognising the biodiversity challenge faced by the environmental assets in Australia. It is critically important to our tourism industry and important to the environment of Australia.</DOC>

I also referred to departmental advice that it would be beneficial to reduce the numbers on Christmas Island, which I responded to. - It is also the case, and it is on the public record, that a number of Christmas Island residents have expressed the view that the number of people should be reduced on Christmas Island, which has been responded to as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Of course, the government will welcome contributions by representatives of industry to the carbon-pricing debate, including by BlueScope Steel. I am aware of comments made yesterday by the Chairman of BlueScope, Mr Graham Kraehe. In part he expressed dissatisfaction at the level of consultation with his company. I take this opportunity to put the record straight. BlueScope was extensively consulted on the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the last term of parliament and in this term of parliament, since I have been the minister, I have met with representatives of the company on five occasions, including twice through the government's business roundtable, of which the BlueScope CEO, Mr O'Malley, is a member. The evidence of the consultation does not match the assertions that Mr Kraehe has made on this point.Secondly, today the Australian Financial Review reported that BlueScope, as the Prime Minister made some observations about a moment ago, will now abandon plans to build a $1 billion cogeneration plant at the Port Kembla steelworks. The implication of the story was that this is somehow related to the proposed carbon price. This is an example of the misinformation that has unfortunately entered this debate, because in fact the Illawarra Mercury reported that BlueScope's announcement not to proceed with the cogeneration plant was made on 21 February, three days before the government's carbon price framework was announced.That was not the only time that BlueScope's plans for that plant had been cancelled or deferred. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 May 2009 it was reported that BlueScope would cancel its plans for the cogeneration plant because, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the argument was, at that time, that the emissions trading scheme planned by the government was not coming in soon enough. So the argument has shifted about a bit. The argument back then was that BlueScope had to defer or cancel the plans because there was no carbon price but now it is apparently, or at least inferred, that the cancellation is related to a carbon price announcement.Finally, Mr Kraehe yesterday made a number of comments about the potential impact of a carbon price on BlueScope Steel's operations. As the detailed features of the carbon price mechanism, including the assistance arrangements for BlueScope's operations, are in fact the subject of the consultation process involving the company and are yet to be settled, Mr Kraehe's observations are, at best, a bit premature. - The government has made clear that we will be providing assistance to support jobs and competitiveness in the most affected industries, including steel. It is worthwhile noting that under the government's previous scheme, the carbon pollution reduction scheme, BlueScope would have received 94.5 per cent of their permits for free, very substantially offsetting their carbon liability. - The government certainly understands the pressure that the steel industry is under through the combined effects of the high Australian dollar, increased coking coal and iron ore commodity prices and a significant supply of steel on world markets. The government is committed to working closely with the steel industry over its carbon liability and the assistance arrangements to apply, but in this discussion calm, reasoned and empirically based debate will best serve the public policy outcome that we all desire.</DOC>

 - As I have made clear, there is an Australian Federal Police investigation into the violent and unacceptable incidents on Christmas Island last week. That Australian Federal Police investigation may well lead to the laying of charges by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Under our system, that is how it works; directors of public prosecutions lay charges, not ministers.I have also indicated that I will regard the character test very seriously in the granting of visas on this matter. As the Prime Minister has indicated to the House, there is a process to be undertaken in relation to the character test. That test must be applied on a case-by-case basis. As the Prime Minister explained this the other day, the shadow minister for immigration interjected and said, 'The minister's intervention power is not appellable.' I think he has been getting legal advice from George Brandis again because he is wrong. Ministers' intervention powers are not appellable in some instances. The minister's decision to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds can be appellable.I know he is getting advice from George Brandis. I do not think he is getting it from the member for Menzies because, if he were getting advice from the member for Menzies, the member for Menzies would be saying, 'Scott, do not forget Haneef because I got it wrong.' I do not think the government wants to get it wrong in this instance because the minister for immigration is following the process, which the former minister, the member for Menzies, did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for that question because there is extensive consultation with the business community on this very important economic reform.There are only two certainties here: all nations will have to act and the longer we wait the much tougher the transition will be, which is why the government is determined to act and to work in a consultative way, particularly with the business community. It is why we have commissioned new, updated analysis from Ross Garnaut, it is why we have commissioned the Productivity Commission and it is why the Treasury is doing new modelling. We have a number of forums where we are consulting with the business community.I want to make this point because I say to all those in the business community, and there is a very broad coalition that is supporting this essential reform: do not be intimidated by some of the irresponsible elements of the community. This is too important a reform for the future of our economy for those that understand the importance of this to our future prosperity, to jobs for our kids and our grandkids. Stay involved with the process and do not be intimidated by some of the shouting and yelling that we are seeing from the Tea Party fringe elements that are out there in this debate. We do need a debate but we need a debate that is based on fact. One of the most important facts was outlined recently by Jac Nasser of BHP Billiton. He said:Economies that defer action are likely to face higher long-term costs, as global investment is redirected to early movers. As one of the most carbon-intense economies, if Australia acts strongly to reduce its carbon footprint, its emissions-intensive sectors are likely to maintain or improve their competitiveness in a low-emissions world.That sums up the economic case for this fundamental reform. It is one that is essential for the future of the nation; it is right for the country, it is right for the economy and we should not be deterred by extreme elements in the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Swan for his question. It raises a matter that was also raised with me yesterday by the member for Cook. I had intended at the conclusion of question time to table a letter that I provided the member for Cook with earlier today.The matter the member for Swan raises relates to SIEV36. I can say to him that I am advised that one of the persons on SIEV36 was charged in November 2010 with two counts of resisting Commonwealth officers and the matter has been committed to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The relevant offences carry a maximum penalty of two years. As you would be aware, it is a matter of public record that has been confirmed previously in the House that this is one of three individuals about whom I believe the member is asking.As I advised the member for Cook in writing, a person's visa may be considered for cancellation if the person fails the character test under section 501 of the Migration Act. As is appropriate, the minister is awaiting the outcome of these criminal proceedings before considering any action in relation to this person. As the matter is still before the court, obviously it is inappropriate for me to comment further.I am advised that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, after consultation with the Northern Territory Director of Public Prosecutions and the Northern Territory Police, has determined that there is insufficient evidence to bring further charges. The letter goes on to clarify what would be well understood and well known, and that is that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions makes those decisions independent of government. That has been the case under governments of all persuasions; and so it should, because of the separation of powers that we have - the DPP acts independently.I would also indicate to the member, in case there is any further concern, that the issues relating to SIEV36 were extensively canvassed in the parliament last year on 17 March and then more briefly, I think, on the day after. I am advised that around five questions were asked about this matter on 17 March last year. The topic the member raises is not new; I understand that he is concerned about it, and I refer him to the letter that I have provided to the member for Cook. I table that now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. Of course she was one of many members in this House who spent the weeks of summer assisting communities that were hit by natural disasters. In her case it was the city of Rockhampton being hit by flooding and being isolated for quite an extended period of time. Members on both sides of the House were called upon to assist their communities in that time of flooding. Members are still, in some parts of the country, being called upon to assist communities that have suffered flooding in recent days.During that period, as we emerged from that summer of natural disasters with the flooding and then the cyclone, I made a pledge on the nation's behalf - and that pledge was that we would not let go. We would assist the communities that had suffered so greatly during this period to rebuild. I said that all Australians would be with them during the rebuilding and recovery effort and that we would get on with it with good judgment and common purpose so that we could assist these communities to rebuild and to get on with their lives.Last night two bills passed the Senate, the 51st and 52nd bills to do so in this parliament. They were the legislation to fund the reconstruction and recovery effort. We know these disasters have come at a terrible human cost and a cost to the economy. Queensland, which suffered so badly, is over one-fifth of our economy, and early Treasury and RBA estimates suggest that GDP growth will be half a per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case. Crop production will be around $1.2 billion less, there will be $300 million less in tourism, and coal production could be 16 million tonnes less in the March quarter.As we go about this recovery and rebuilding we do know that, despite this economic setback from natural disasters, the underlying economy is strong. That is why it is appropriate to pay as we go. As the economy trends back to full capacity we will not take the soft option by deferring hard savings until four years from now. That is why the government took the decision to engage in savings. It was not easy, but it was the right thing to do. And we took the decision to defer infrastructure; once again, it was not easy, but it was the right thing to do. And we also took the decision to ask the Australian people - people of goodwill - to pay a flood levy, which was very fairly constructed so that 60 per cent of taxpayers are paying less than a dollar a week.Of course, we made these tough decisions; we found the tough saves, rather than claiming it was easy. In doing so we did not play the politics of fear. We did not cut programs to earn a cheap headline. We got on with the methodical decision making necessary to rebuild Queensland and to rebuild the nation. As we know -  - And, of course, we will rebuild Victoria too. The House would recall that the government's plan was met by the politics of fear. The government's plan was met by a scare campaign led by the Leader of the Opposition. That scare campaign is silent now. What we should learn from that example is that, ultimately, the Leader of the Opposition's carbon pricing scare campaign will fall silent too - indeed, there is some evidence it has already fallen silent today - because fear cannot stand up against facts, and we will be there explaining the facts. - And I thank the Leader of the House for his very timely reminder. With those words -  - and with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition showing the intelligence she is famous for, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, I would suggest to him that he read the story carefully. Secondly, I will confirm to him that tax cuts are a live option for providing assistance to Australian households under this government. Of course, if the Leader of the Opposition were ever elected, the very first thing he would do is rip money out of the purses and wallets of Australians, take away the household assistance we have provided and then impose on them a charge of $720 a year for his failed plan to address climate change, even though we know - or most days, we know - that the Leader of the Opposition does not believe in climate change. Some days he does, some days he does not.This all comes down to a question of judgment, a question of leadership and to making decisions in the national interest. If you are acting in the national interest, if you are showing judgment, then you accept the science that climate change is real. You accept the economic advice that the best way of tackling it is by pricing carbon. You accept the further economic advice that the best way of doing that is through an emissions trading scheme and, if you believe in fairness, then you act to use the money raised from carbon pricing to assist Australian households.Let me say again to the Leader of the Opposition: in assisting Australian households, tax cuts are a live option. Then of course you use the money raised from carbon pricing to assist industries to adjust and then you use money raised from carbon pricing to tackle climate change through funding climate change programs. These things are questions of judgment and questions of leadership. It is the judgment and the leadership that Prime Minister John Howard showed when he went to the 2007 election promising an emissions trading scheme. But, as Australians saw yesterday, they can never expect leadership or judgment from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her strong representation of her local community in this place. As a strong representative of her local community who believes in coming into this place and acting in the national interest, she knows that it is in the national interest to tackle climate change and that it is in the national interest to price carbon and to create the right mix of incentives and rewards to enable the development of clean energy solutions.At the moment you can put carbon pollution into the atmosphere for nothing. By pricing carbon, we will send a signal to the thousand biggest polluters in this country that there is a cost when they put carbon pollution into the atmosphere. As a result they will innovate and they will change. Australian businesses are very adaptable. They have adapted to economic reform in the past and they will do so again in the future. With the money raised from pricing carbon, you can assist Australian households, which we will do - and we will do so fairly because we are a Labor government - you can assist Australian industries make the transition and you can fund programs to tackle climate change.In answer to the question from the member for Greenway, which asked me about the national interest, let me make some things very clear to the House. It is no wonder that shadow cabinet met twice to try to stop the shadow Treasurer belling the cat and confirming to the Australian people that, if we compensate and assist households through tax cuts, the opposition will take them away; if we assist households through direct increases in pensions, the Leader of the Opposition will take those increases away; and if we assist through direct payments, the Leader of the Opposition will take those away. We will assist Australian households and the Leader of the Opposition is committed to taking that assistance away.But it gets worse than that - worse than taking money out of the purses and wallets of Australians. The Leader of the Opposition is committed to a failed plan which would see carbon pollution in our economy rise by 17 per cent by 2020 - rising carbon emissions - or the Leader of the Opposition would rip $720 off Australians to pay for his $30 billion worth of failed plans. So more assistance but more tax to be paid by Australian families - decent people who understand that this is a big challenge which, in our national interest, we need to face up to.Decent people work their way through the facts and they think about these things very deeply. The Leader of the Opposition has taken a different course. That stands in stark contrast to the things that have been done by Liberal leaders in the past. I would refer the House to the Shergold report, the report of the task group on emissions trading, which made it clear to Prime Minister Howard - which is why he adopted the scheme - that it is the most efficient way of pricing carbon. Unfortunately, the present Leader of the Opposition is not a fit successor to Liberal leaders past. He has repudiated the power of the markets. He has repudiated the national interest. He would prefer to act in his political interests with his fear campaigns than act decently in the interests of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow finance minister for adding to the member for Greenway's question - an unusual move! The shadow finance minister asked me about the Productivity Commission review of international carbon pricing, and I think this is an important piece of work; I do. Gary Banks spoke about it on behalf of the Productivity Commission, and, as usual, when the opposition comes into this place and quotes documents, they quote selected pieces or indeed just misquote them entirely, because I will refer the shadow finance minister to the conclusion of Mr Banks's speech. He said these words in conclusion:While we may not be able to deliver everything that some people expect, I am confident the study can shed light on what other countries are doing, how the various policies work, the uncertainties surrounding the efficacy of many of them, how much they achieve and at what cost.This is the work that the Productivity Commission has been asked to do to provide a stream of advice about action that is happening in other nations to embrace a clean energy future. This is one of a number of important pieces of work that are informing the government as we deliberate on carbon pricing. Those pieces of work include the reports and updates that people have seen released by Professor Garnaut over the past few weeks. Of course, we will also be informed by Treasury modelling.The point that the shadow finance minister should draw from that is that there will be abundant information and facts available about the key matters that require judgment in the national leadership. Is climate change real? Well, there were climate change scientists in this parliament today available to members, hosted on a bipartisan basis, to talk about how the science is real, even though the Leader of the Opposition goes around denying it. Then of course we have the economic advice about the efficient means of acting, and the most efficient means of acting is by putting a price on carbon. Then we will have the Productivity Commission work, which will add to other streams of knowledge about how the rest of the world is acting, including China, India and the United States. What this means is that the shadow minister - who is not prepared to act in the national interest but joins the Leader of the Opposition in his fear campaign - would prefer that the economic future of this country had us being left behind the clean energy future of the rest of the world, with all the loss of prosperity that that would provide.As this parliamentary week draws to a conclusion, I believe members, particularly coalition backbenchers, will leave this place thinking about questions of judgment. They will go back to their electorates and think about the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition as he denies the climate change science. They will think about the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition as he shares a platform with Pauline Hanson, something John Howard would never have done. - I am talking about this parliament acting in the national interest; I am sure that should be relevant on all occasions. The government will continue to do that by pricing carbon, and people will look at the Leader of the Opposition, who called it wrong on the flood levy, who called it wrong on the health agreement, who is calling it wrong now and who particularly called it wrong yesterday, as a hollow man with no judgment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. The government respects the climate science and the need to cut our pollution. Today, like a number of members of the House, I had a meeting with representatives of Climate Scientists Australia who reiterated to me, as they have done to many others today, the need to take action on climate change. They were in the building today because a forum was organised by the members for Chisholm, Moore and Melbourne on climate science for the benefit of parliamentarians. I am very pleased that members from both sides of the House attended that forum. However, there are others who obviously contest the science and oppose action being taken on climate change.The member for Cowan then left the chamber. - At the rally at Parliament House yesterday, which the Leader of the Opposition had encouraged as part of the people's revolt, the following sentiments were expressed on placards held by the protesters on the issue of the science: 'Carbon really ain't pollution', 'No carbon tax, reject junk science', 'Carbon dioxide is not pollution, I love CO2', 'Say no to carbon tax 4 UN/IMF global governance=agenda 21 genocide'. As we saw on television last night, there was much worse.The so-called people's revolt against carbon pricing has also attracted, as we have heard, supporters such as One Nation, Pauline Hanson, the League of Rights and a number of climate change sceptics. It is important for leaders of the community, and particularly the leaders of major political parties, to not be associated with extremes in the debate over carbon pricing. - Not only has the Leader of the Opposition refused to clearly to dissociate himself from these groups but last night on ABC TV he said, 'That was a representative snapshot of middle Australia.' Well, you must be kidding. I am sure that there would be many on the opposite benches that did not find it representative of their own views or of the values and traditions of the Liberal Party either. The fact is that it was not befitting someone who wants to be leader of our nation. It goes to character and judgment as well as the ability to provide true leadership on an important public policy question. - All of this is important in this debate because what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition is lots of aggression and not much courage when it really counts.It is worthwhile reflecting on the words of Prime Minister, John Howard, to the Melbourne Press Club on 17 July 2007, when explaining the need to act on climate change through an emissions trading scheme because these are in the tradition of the Liberal Party. He said:Australia brings formidable assets to this challenge: an educated, can-do and adaptable people a modern; flexible economy; world class scientific expertise; deep global engagement and an enviable reputation for institution-building and reform _ No great challenge has ever yielded to fear or guilt. Nor will this one.I could not agree with it more.The member for Flinders then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and let me assure the member I am all for the facts in this debate. In fact, one of the sharpest contrasts between the government and the opposition in this debate is: we are dealing with the facts; you are dealing with fear. We accept the climate change science; you do not. We accept the advice of economists that the most efficient way to act is to price carbon; you do not. We accept the collection of data from around the world about how other economies are moving, including China, and we have asked the Productivity Commission to report on that very fact; and I have got no doubt whatsoever when the Productivity Commission comes out with its work, then over there on the opposition benches they will distort it, they will misquote and they will go on a campaign of misleading to fit with their fear campaign, which is drawing them closer and closer to the extremes of Australian politics. - Thank you very much in directing my attention to the second part of the question that the member asked me. The second part of the question would lead people to conclude that somehow having a price on carbon, advocating a price on carbon, does not mean that you care about Australian jobs. Well, let me quote a statement from someone who had the aspiration to have 'the most comprehensive emissions trading scheme anywhere in the world'. Would the member assert that the person who said that did not care about Australian jobs? Then let me go on and quote words by the same person, who said:No great challenge has ever yielded to fear or guilt. Nor will this one.And then went on to say -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Those words that I used, 'the most comprehensive emissions trading scheme anywhere in the world' are the words of former Prime Minister John Howard. In saying those words, why was John Howard then insisting on a price on carbon the way I am insisting on one now? I would suggest it is because we went through exactly the same thought processes, which is: climate change is real. I believe John Howard accepted the science. -  - You sit behind a climate change denier. John Howard asked for a comprehensive report from Peter Shergold about the best way of pricing carbon. When he received it he read it and responded to it rationally - something that the opposition is now incapable of: reading, thinking and responding rationally - and, having done that, he determined that the best way forward for this country was an emissions trading scheme. He said the nation should price carbon. I believe the nation should price carbon, and that is why we will bring legislation to the Australian parliament to do just that.I understand the member opposite will follow the Leader of the Opposition in a fear campaign, but I suspect in his heart of hearts he is actually one of the members sitting over there who watched with dismay yesterday. I wonder when he got his Liberal ticket -  - excited as he was on that first day to join the Liberal Party, that he ever foresaw it would come to this. -  - Well, let me tell you something about John -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In conclusion, pricing carbon is about future prosperity for the economy. That is why I am insisting on it. John Howard understood that, and he was a Liberal leader who would not have shared a platform with Pauline Hanson.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. This is about the Gloucester coal seam gas proposal. I saw the photographs on Twitter of a rally which the member for Lyne participated in, with placards like 'Save Gloucester' behind him when he made a speech. There has been a high degree of community concern in many areas relating to coal seam gas proposals and some of that goes to the issues related to the best use of prime agricultural land. I do note, in passing, the legislation introduced today by the Minister for Climate Change on the Carbon Farming Initiative, which will provide a further incentive in favour of prime agricultural land being used for those purposes.The federal environmental approvals are not able to deal with everything that is dealt with at a state level. They have to deal quite specifically with matters of national environmental significance. The state remit on consideration is often much broader. In 2008 my department determined that this proposal would require an assessment under federal environmental law. The state processes, as I am advised here, were concluded in February of this year. Whether the state government wanted to reopen those would be a matter for the state government; it is not something that I would be able to insist on.In terms of federal assessment being required, there are consultation mechanisms available to me when the brief does come to me on this as to whether or not we want to have a further level of consultation beyond what has happened already. That is something that I will not prejudge, but will deal with when the brief is presented to me. I presume from the information that I have here that that will not be too far away.There is one listed vulnerable species and there is a Ramsar listed site in the Hunter estuary, both of which give rise to matters of national environmental significance. They will be considered in the light of the law - the EPBC Act. I expect that brief to come to me before long.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for that very important question. Reforms, particularly long-term reforms, are very important for our future prosperity. We would not enter our 20th year of economic growth if we had not embarked upon very significant economic reform in the past. It is absolutely essential to prosperity into the future, which is why the government is getting on with reform.It is getting on with the introduction of the mineral resource rent tax. Today, with the Minister for Resources and Energy, I announced our response to the Argus report. This is a very important way of getting access to resource rents which are owned by the Australian people. Through this tax we now have the capacity to reform our economy: to boost national savings; to make a very significant commitment to the superannuation savings of 3.5 million low-income earning Australians; to cut company taxation; in particular, to cut the taxation for small businesses; and - most particularly - to make an investment in infrastructure, particularly in our resource-rich states of Western Australia and Queensland.We have to do this because the challenges of mining boom mark 2 mean that we need to make the investment in the infrastructure so we are not bedevilled by capacity constraints, and so we can handle the huge pipeline of investment that is going to create more jobs as we go forward. So this is a very important reform. It will raise $7.4 billion to fund those tax cuts, particularly for small business and the investment and infrastructure.But we have now got to the point where those opposite have become so extreme and so bizarre that they oppose this revenue; they oppose receiving $7.4 billion to give a tax cut to small business, they oppose giving a tax cut to the company tax rate, they oppose increases in superannuation for low-income earners and they oppose investment in infrastructure.This is of a piece with their opposition to abolish mortgage exit fees as high as $7,000 when people want to shift their mortgage. The extremism of those opposite knows no bounds. When it comes to either sticking up for the big end of town or sticking up for Australian families, they stick up for the big end of town. They are not siding with ordinary Australian families; whether it is a carbon price, whether it is a competitive banking system or whether it is for fair taxation in the resources sector, they are siding for even bigger super profits for mining companies against the Australian people. They are signing up for more profitable banks against a fair deal in the banking system, and they are supporting the big polluters against average Australians. It is about time they did the right thing by average Australians, instead of sticking up for the big end of town.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. She raises with me statements by Toyota. I have actually directly and personally consulted with Toyota on the question of carbon pricing. I did it yesterday, as it turns out. I know others were engaged elsewhere, but I was speaking to Toyota and, as I regularly do, to businesses: businesses around the country; businesses that trade in Australia; businesses that employ a lot of Australians. What businesses say to me is that they understand climate change is real. They accept the science that the Leader of the Opposition rejects. Of course, because they are businesspeople, they are always working out what is the lowest priced way of driving change. That is what gives them their competitive advantage as businesspeople. So they accept the advice of economists that the best way of tackling carbon pollution is to price carbon.Then, of course, businesses want to be heard on this major public policy reform. They want to be heard on this major public policy reform in the way they have been heard on public policy reforms in the past when we have transformed our economy and adapted -  - when they have looked to be engaged as tariffs went down, as we floated the dollar and as we drove Australia to its competitive, prosperous position today. They have wanted their voices to be heard, and of course their voices are being heard as the government goes about the work of designing the carbon-pricing mechanism.As I have indicated to the House during the course of this week, the CEO of BlueScope is involved in our business roundtable. I spoke to Toyota yesterday; of course, they are directly engaged as well, putting their views forward. So I would suggest to the member for Indi that if she wants to come into this place and quote the views of Australian businesses then for completeness she should talk about the views of Australian businesses as a whole. I would say to her that Australian businesses are not in denial of the future. They understand that we need a clean-energy economy, they understand that this will take change and they understand -  - Thank you very much. Responding to the latter part of the question, what I would say to the member for Indi is that we will work with Australian businesses as we go about pricing carbon. I would also say to the member for Indi that, if she wants to be fulsome and clear with these businesses when she is apparently having these discussions - or perhaps she is just taking statements from the media, but when she is discussing questions with businesses - she may want to indicate to them that she contested the 2007 election on Prime Minister Howard's team. Prime Minister Howard went to that election promising the most comprehensive emissions trading system anywhere in the world. He went to that election informed by this report -  - and he went to that election saying:Being among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will bring new opportunities and we intend to grasp them.I would like to remind the member for Indi of that. She might want to reflect on that position of the 2007 election before she dedicates herself to spreading fear today.</DOC>
