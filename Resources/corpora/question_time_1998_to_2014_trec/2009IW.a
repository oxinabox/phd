The Rudd Government recognises the significant impact of child care fees and the first Budget has taken some major steps toward assisting with those costs. From 1 July 2008, the Child Care Tax Rebate increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket child care costs, up to $7500 per child in approved care. This benefit is not means tested and is payable to parents and guardians who are working, studying or training. The Child Care Tax Rebate can be paid quarterly or taken as an annual lump sum payment.The Government is establishing up to 260 additional early learning and child care services over the next six years. This will increase the supply of child care places in areas of unmet demand. The successful service providers would be required to demonstrate a capacity to deliver high quality, affordable child care.We are also undertaking significant reforms to build capacity in the workforce to address the shortage of skilled child care workers, create national consistency in quality standards and licensing, and providing universal access to 15 hours of affordable early learning a week, 40 weeks a year, for all children in the year before formal schooling.The Rudd Government is committed to providing families with access to better information about child care, so that they can readily identify the services that best meet their needs. Providing parents with access to the best possible information is a starting point for increased competition and improved transparency in the sector.On 22 October 2008 I, together with the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, Maxine McKew, the Minister for Families and Community Services, Jenny Macklin and 2003 Australian of the Year, Professor Fiona Stanley, launched the mychild.gov.au website.mychild.gov.au is a virtual children's hub for parents and carers which provides access to important health, early learning, child care and parenting support information in one convenient location. mychild.gov.au includes a searchable database of local child care centres including the services they provide and the fees they charge. The Government will build on this information as the new Quality Framework is developed and delivered from July 2009.Information on services fees will also be available via the Child Care Access Hotline, a telephone service provided by the Government that gives parents information to help them choose a child care service that meets their needs. When calling the Child Care Access Hotline, a professionally trained operator provides parents with information about child care services and possible vacancies in their area, types of child care available, quality issues, and Government financial assistance with the cost of child care. Various child care options such as long day care, family day care, in-home care, outside school hours care and occasional care are explained so that parents can make an informed choice.Providing greater information to parents is part of the Rudd Government's comprehensive plan to deliver high quality, affordable and accessible child care for Australian children. This is also part of creating a more transparent market for child care services.The Government thanks those 8000 child care services across the country which voluntarily provided information for publication on mychild.gov.au and the Child Care Access Hotline and looks forward to receiving information from even more centres in the future.</DOC>

The Government is continuing with the extension of ABC NewsRadio services to transmission areas with a population of 10,000 or more, and funding for the third and final stage of the rollout program was confirmed in the 2008-09 Budget. This including funding to allow services for Townsville and Townsville North to proceed.However, spectrum is congested for high power services in the Townsville region and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), which is responsible for the planning of these services, was only able to identify two FM channels which, subject to on-air tests to assess potential interference issues, could be considered for the Townsville NewsRadio services.While laboratory testing had suggested that the proposed frequencies could be used without resulting in interference, ACMA considered that on-air test transmissions should be conducted to confirm the usability of the proposed frequencies.The on-air testing of these frequencies required two other services operating in the area at Charters Towers and Bowen to first be relocated to new frequencies. This in turn required changes to be made to the Townsville and Charters Towers Licence Area Plans (LAPs) and such proposals are subject to a public consultation process.Submissions to the public consultation process closed in September 2008 and the matter was subsequently considered by the ACMA Board at its meeting on 20 November 2008. At that meeting ACMA approved the variations to the Townsville and Charters Towers LAPs, enabling the on-air test transmissions to now proceed.The ABC anticipates commencing the first phase of test transmissions in Townsville in December 2008. The second phase of test transmissions, which may take several weeks, is expected to be conducted in March or April 2009 once suitable high-power transmission equipment has been installed at the main Townsville site on Mt Stuart. It would be expected that the Townsville NewsRadio services would commence after the conclusion of the second phase of test transmissions, subject to the tests being successful.</DOC>

The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) is investing $10 million to establish a cyclotron facility.To manufacture FDG (fluoro deoxy glucose) for use in PET (positron emission tomography) scanning.The production of radiopharmaceuticals to improve the health of Australians is a central element of ANSTO's mission. At the time when this proposal was accepted by the ANSTO Board, there was a significant impending shortfall in FDG production capacity in Sydney, with no extant proposals to fill it. Current market projections would indicate that there will be sufficient demand to allow both the ANSTO facility and the proposed competitor to operate in the market.See answer above. In terms of funding, PETNET Australia  -  the ANSTO subsidiary set up to construct and operate the cyclotron facility - is operating at arm's length from ANSTO. ANSTO provided PETNET Australia with a $10 million start-up loan, on which PETNET Australia is paying commercial interest rates.</DOC>

The term 'tidal movements' can refer to both currents due to tides, and to vertical tide motions. In either case, the mean tidal movement is zero averaged over a tidal cycle. The tidal range, being the difference between low tide and high tide, along the Kimberley coast is from 10.5 metres at Derby in King Sound to 11.6 metres at Shale Island in Collier Bay.The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has advised that it is aware of only one large scale tidal barrage energy plant currently operating in the world, in La Rance in France.</DOC>

(b) Yes: Article 10(b) of the Constitution specifies that no law contrary to any tenet of Islam will be enacted.We are not aware of any Maldivians losing their citizenship due to the enactment of the new Constitution. The Attorney General's Department of the Maldives has advised DFAT that citizens who convert from Islam in the future would not lose their citizenship. But the new Constitution remains untested in a court of law in this respect. The Constitution, Article 9 (b), states that 'No citizen of Maldives may be deprived of citizenship'.The Australian Government supports the right to religious freedom.The Government, via the Australian High Commission in Colombo, will continue to engage the new Government of Maldives with regard to democratic reform and human rights issues.</DOC>

The not for profit sector has not sought a formal response from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in relation to whether participation in the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) would have an adverse impact on the charitable endorsement of a charity. The Courts have shown that determining charitable status is a question of fact which needs to be determined on the basis of the facts of each particular organisation.However, the ATO has provided advice to the charities sector to assist them in making informed decisions, by discussing aspects of the NRAS in various forums, including with the charities consultative committee.I refer the honourable Member to my press release of 12 November 2008, entitled National Rental Affordability Scheme - Participation by Charities where I have confirmed that 'the Australian Government will introduce a transitional safety net by amending both charity and tax laws. The amendment will mean that the proposed participation of existing charities in the Establishment Phase of NRAS will not affect their charitable status.'I refer the honourable Member to my press release of 12 November 2008, entitled National Rental Affordability Scheme - Participation by Charities where I have clarified the Government's response to this issue.</DOC>

Iraq defaulted on payments of US$476 million relating to sales contracts for wheat shipped prior to the Gulf War.These shipments were insured by the Australian Government through the National Interest Account of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, which provided cover for 80 per cent of the amounts involved. The government paid the former Australian Wheat Board (AWB) the insured sum of US$381.2 million which was distributed to growers.In November 2004, the previous Australian government and 17 other creditor nations agreed to forgive 80 per cent of Iraq's total debt. This included its debt to Australia which amounted to US$1,072 million at that time. The agreement requires Iraq to repay the remaining 20 per cent of the debt between 2011 and 2028.</DOC>

Between 1 November 2007 and 1 November 2008, an additional 15 sites have commenced supplying Opal fuel. This includes 12 communities and 3 roadhouses/service stations.As at 1 November 2008 there are 119 sites supplying Opal fuel. This includes 84 communities, 32 roadhouses / service stations and 3 pastoral properties.To maintain the privacy of individual communities, the Department of Health and Ageing (DHA) does not release the names of communities receiving Opal fuel.Three communities in the south and one community in the north of the East Kimberley region are already receiving Opal fuel.The comprehensive rollout of Opal fuel to the East Kimberley region has been delayed as a result of commercial supply chain and fuel distribution issues. These issues arise because Opal fuel is currently only stored and distributed from Largs North, South Australia. To overcome these issues, DHA is working to identify a more efficient and accessible option for Opal fuel distribution in northern Australia.There are eight roadhouses not including Alice Springs located on the Stuart Highway in the designated Petrol Sniffing Strategy zones that support the Australian Government's efforts to reduce petrol sniffing by supplying Opal fuel. A small number of fuel retailers in Central Australia have opted not to supply Opal fuel despite DHA's efforts to address their concerns. The Australian Government continues to consult with relevant stakeholders to progress the introduction of Opal fuel to these locations.</DOC>

It is not possible to determine the cause of the precise difference between the prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Melbourne on 7 November 2008. However, divergences between LPG prices in major metropolitan cities and regional towns may be explained by the varying market conditions in these localities.Traditionally, Melbourne's automotive LPG market has been the most competitive, and has had the lowest automotive LPG prices in Australia. This reflects the significantly larger volumes of automotive LPG sold in the Melbourne market compared to other major metropolitan cities and regional towns. According to the 2007 ABS Motor Vehicle Census, the number of LPG registered vehicles in Melbourne was about 5 times greater than in Brisbane.Other local competitive factors may also impact on the LPG price differential in seemingly similar localities, including smaller population sizes, greater distance from storage facilities, the level of competition and the presence of discount retailers.</DOC>

As advised in the responses to the Senate Estimates Questions on Notice 262 (June 2008) and 899 (October 2008), as the new Employment Services are not based on the current model it is not possible to isolate the specific areas of saving and hence provide an exact breakdown.In general terms the savings have been achieved by reducing red tape and unnecessary administration.</DOC>

The new employment services are demand driven and designed to be flexible to respond to changing economic conditions, including the forecast increase in unemployment.Every eligible person who needs services to find employment will receive assistance under the new employment services.The new services will ensure assistance is commensurate with each job seeker's needs and level of disadvantage.The government will continue to liaise and consult closely with stakeholders in the lead up and during the implementation of the new employment services, which begin July 1, 2009.The new employment services along with measures announced as part of the Government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, including an increase of 56 000 training places under the Productivity Places Program, will ensure Australia is in the best position to weather the current global financial crisis and skill its workforce for future development.</DOC>

Evidence of participation in a non vocational activity may be established in a number of different ways, including written and verbal advice. The level of documentary evidence required for an individual job seeker will be determined by the employment service provider based on the nature of the non vocational activity and the individual job seeker's circumstances.Providers will be required to monitor the job seeker's participation and attendance at appointments and activities, including non vocational activities, included in a job seeker's Employment Pathways Plan. If a job seeker fails to participate in an activity included in the Employment Pathways Plan, providers are required to ascertain if the job seeker had a reasonable excuse, and if compliance action is warranted.As is the case now, participation in some interventions can not be mandatory, for example medical treatment. This will continue to be the case.The guidelines for documentary evidence for Employment Services 2009-12 will be made available to employment services providers prior to the commencement of the new employment services on 1 July 2009.</DOC>

As is currently the case under the Job Network arrangements, the new Employment Services system as described in the Request for Tender for Employment Services 2009-12, does not specify a minimum number of hours of service for direct one-on-one interviews.Services provided in Stream 1 will be commensurate with the relative job readiness of job seekers eligible for this stream. Post the Initial Interview, Skills Assessment and Intensive Activity (at around 4 months), providers are expected to maintain regular contact with job seekers. Contact is to be at least monthly and must be face to face. These contacts will focus on reviewing and updating the job seeker's Employment Pathway Plan, discussing job search activities and identifying appropriate job vacancies, as well as, relevant training, work experience or other interventions. The contacts will also review the job seeker's progress towards overcoming identified vocational barriers. If job seekers do not move into a higher Stream following the 12 month review, they will commence Work Experience activities. During the Work Experience Phase providers will maintain bi-monthly contact and will continue to support job search activities.In comparison, the current arrangements see job seekers contacted on a sporadic basis post four months. Job seekers participate in Work for the Dole between six and twelve months and have contact with their Job Network member at 7, 10 (and again post Intensive Support customised assistance) at 20 and 22 months and then bimonthly from 32 months.</DOC>

21 centres are managed by ABC Learning Centres, however, Defence also has priority of access for Defence personnel in an additional 20 expansion centres. The places in the expansion centres are subject to demand and availability.This information is not available to the Department of Defence. However, as at September 2008 there were 985 Defence children (children of either ADF personnel or Defence civilians) enrolled at Defence child care centres nationally. There were a further 468 Defence children enrolled at ABC expansion centres that offer priority of access to Defence families.19 centres. There are also two centres that are leased by Defence and managed by ABC Corporate Care.20. As previously noted, the places are subject to demand and availability.Defence has been working closely with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) Child Care Task Force, the lead Australian Government agency on this matter, and the Receiver.to (c) Defence has a clause in the ABC contract to terminate the contract at any point with 'step in rights', at Defence's discretion. Defence continues to work closely with the DEEWR task force and the Receiver. Defence has received proposals from the Receiver and needs to complete a review process before taking any action. Defence is researching all of its options throughout this collaborative process.No Defence centres, either owned, leased or expansion centres, will close. Nevertheless, Defence has established a task force to examine the future of the Defence Child Care Program and to ensure that high quality child care remains available to all Defence families. Defence plans to resolve this issue by 31 March 2009, in line with the Government's extension of its support funding.</DOC>

Freedom of speech is fundamentally important in a democratic society. For many years however, most Australians have accepted that there is some material which is not acceptable, particularly for children, to view. The Commonwealth State and Territory Parliaments have passed various laws about this material.The scope of the definition of 'prohibited content' cannot be expanded without changes to legislation being passed by Parliament.'Prohibited content' is defined under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA) as content which has been classified by the National Classification Board as:Refused Classification (RC);X 18+;R 18+, where that content is not subject to a 'restricted access system' which limits its access to adults; orMA 15+, where that content is provided commercially and is made available for a fee, and not subject to a restricted access system.Content which has not been classified but which would, if classified, be prohibited content is known as 'potential prohibited content' and is determined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).If prohibited content is hosted in Australia, ACMA must under Schedule 7 of the BSA issue a 'take-down' notice requiring the content be removed or blocked from public access. It is an offence for a content service provider not to comply with a take-down notice.If prohibited content (or potentially prohibited content) is hosted overseas, ACMA must under Schedule 5 of the BSA notify the content to providers of filter software products which have been tested and accredited for participation in the Internet Industry Association's Family Friendly Filter program. This arrangement is set out in an industry Code of Practice. The compilation of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) referred to filter providers is known as the ACMA blacklist.</DOC>

Disability Works Australia and the Department have been working together to implement strategies to increase the number of job placements. One strategy that is being implemented is to increase the number of employers with which the National Disability Recruitment Coordinator works, to identify a greater range of vacancies across geographical locations and industry sectors. It is intended that a more diverse range of job vacancies will then be referred to the relevant Disability Employment Network members and Vocational Rehabilitation Service providers.</DOC>

As advised in the response to question number 396 and Senate Estimates Questions on Notice 262 and 899, as the new Employment Services are not based on the current model it is not possible to isolate the specific areas of saving and hence provide an exact breakdown.In general terms the savings have been achieved by reducing red tape and unnecessary administration.The assumptions used, which run into the thousands, are held within a departmental financial model and are based amongst other factors on a forecast of the number of job seekers to be serviced, their level of disadvantage including their length of unemployment and the number of job seekers who will be placed in employment.Yes.Approximately $350 million are administered funds and $20 million departmental funds.No. These savings are not related in any way to the efficiency dividend applied to the Department.The savings figures have not been revised in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2008-09. The new Employment Services model is demand driven and the forward estimates will need to be updated due to the impact of the Global Financial Crisis.</DOC>

The vehicle purchase decisions of businesses are commercial matters and should ultimately depend on the requirements of the business. The Government does not provide any specific incentives for business purchases of LPG vehicles. These vehicles receive the same treatment as petrol or diesel run vehicles, including being able to claim input tax credits for GST paid on the vehicle and the fuel.Movements in retail LPG and petrol prices in Australia follow different international benchmarks. The international benchmark for automotive LPG is based on the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (Saudi CP), whereas the benchmark price for regular unleaded petrol in Australia is the Singapore Mogas 95. Although the Saudi CP has fallen significantly in US dollar terms over recent months, in Australian dollar terms, it has decreased by less due to a weaker exchange rate. This has impacted on automotive LPG prices at the retail level.</DOC>

Vocational education qualifications are not differentiated by the mode of delivery. All qualifications at a Certificate II, III and IV level can be delivered as apprenticeship pathways if the state or territory in which the qualification is being delivered has chosen to declare that qualification for this purpose.All qualifications can equally be delivered through institutional-only pathways, or through a mix of on-the-job and off-the-job training. Institutional pathways will still often involve work placements, particularly where specific units of competency require a high level of practical experience to achieve competency. As such, there is no requirement for those who have achieved qualifications through a primarily institutional pathway to undertake an 'apprenticeship' to gain on-the-job experience.</DOC>

A bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Australian Government and each State and Territory was used to agree on the arrangements for delivery of State and Territory managed existing worker places to 31 December 2008.The National Partnership Agreement on the Productivity Places Program (NP PPP) includes arrangements for a reconciliation between the MoU and the NP PPP. This process will enable any of the places that were not delivered under the MoU to be delivered under the NP PPP from 1 January 2009. If the NP PPP is not entered into then the there is a provision in the MoU that will allow the MoU arrangements to be extended.</DOC>

Australian Government funding for places that were not taken up by States and Territories has not been reallocated to another Program. It been used to fund a series of National Enterprise Productivity Places Program trials and part of the cost of providing an additional 15 000 job seeker places.Under the National Enterprise trials the Rudd Government will cover up to 50 per cent of the cost for training places, providing around $3 million. The National Enterprises will provide the remaining funding. The trials will begin over the next six months and will be a joint venture between the national Industry Skills Council network and large National Enterprises to increase the skills of existing workers.On 10 September 2008 the Rudd Government announced that it would make available an additional 15,000 training places at the Certificate III level for to job seekers until 30 June 2009. This was in response to the high demand for training by job seekers under the Program since 1 April 2008. All the places originally made available for this year were fully utilised by the beginning of September 2008. Additional places were made available to ensure that job seekers are still able to access training in these crucial skills shortage areas.</DOC>

Between 1 July and 31 December 2008, 9547 existing worker places were allocated to States and Territories through a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). In addition to the MoUs with the States and Territories, up to $3 million for 1250 training places will be provided through a series of National Enterprise Productivity Places Program trials. Through this partnership arrangement, the Australian Government will cover up to 50 per cent of the cost for training places for existing workers and national enterprises will provide the remaining funding.States and Territories have indicated that allocated training places for existing workers will be filled by the expiration of their MoU.Table 1 provides the MoU targets by State and Territory.

Existing worker places will be jointly funded by the Australian Government (50 per cent), State and Territory Governments (40 per cent) and a private contribution (10 per cent).At the March 2008 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) the Australian Government agreed to fund fully the government contribution for the cost of the 4500 priority health places that COAG agreed to make available from 31 July to 31 December 2008. This additional funding contribution will be recognised in the financial arrangements for Phase III of the Program from 1 January 2009 so that that State contribution for these places is ultimately 40 per cent and the Australian Government's 50 per cent. All States and Territories, except South Australia and the ACT, have taken up the Australian Government's offer.

The Australian Government's contribution is shown in Table 2.States and Territories are not required to report on the date when the first existing worker commenced training within the period of the MoU.The private contribution is shown in Table 2.The process for defining, securing and collecting the 10 per cent private contribution is determined by each State and Territory. Generally, Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) will manage the collection and reporting of the 10 per cent contribution. A summary of the arrangements in each State and Territory is provided below.In New South Wales RTOs will manage the collection of the contribution and be required to keep auditable records of the contributions collected. The New South Wales Department of Education will deduct 10 per cent off the purchase price of the qualification from the payment to the RTO for the delivery of the qualification.In Victoria the contribution will be secured through the current fees and charges system operating in Victoria.In Queensland the contribution will be collected and accounted for through current fees and charges system, or through special provisions under new contracts.In Western Australia RTOs will collect the fee payable.In South Australia RTOs will collect the fee payable. When applying for places RTOs are required to demonstrate how a minimum of 10 per cent contribution will be provided.In Tasmania RTOs will collect the 10 per cent contribution and will be required to report on collections.In the ACT the contribution will be paid directly to the RTO.In the Northern Territory the collection of the 10 per cent contribution will be a component of the contract arrangements with successful RTOs therefore it will be the responsibility of the RTO to account for the contributions required.to (11) It is anticipated that all places will be allocated and training commenced by the expiration of the MoUs. Data on enrolments, commencements and completions in the existing worker pilots, has not yet been received. Queensland and South Australia have provided progress reports. Both reports indicated that the PPP is in early stages of implementation. South Australia received applications for more than the target number of places and expects to deliver more than the target number of places.This information is not yet available.</DOC>

The fees paid to service providers and other expenditure for the various employment services programs are not directly based on Job Seeker Classification Instrument score ranges of this kind, or by the individual job seeker's participation in Job Capacity Assessment. As examples, the amount a Job Network provider may expend in Job Seeker Account funds to purchase assistance for a particular individual, or the service fee paid to a Work for the Dole provider are not set on the basis of the job seeker's JSCI score. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations does not, therefore, record employment services expenditure information for specific job seeker categories of the type specified by the honourable member.It is not feasible to provide an answer to the honourable member's question as highly extensive and unreasonable resources would be required for the Department to develop the capacity to report employment services expenditure in the requested detail.</DOC>

The landlord's eviction notice was acknowledged on 24 November 2008 and acted upon by Centrelink.The existing lease at 55 Currie Street expired on 31Â JulyÂ 2008. Centrelink has been negotiating a lease renewal at 55 Currie Street since November 2007, but has been unsuccessful in agreeing to terms with the landlord.Approximately 80 per cent of the customers who regularly use Currie Street do not live in the Adelaide CBD and these customers continue to have access to their local Customer Service Centre (CSC). The current customer base will be serviced by a combination of appropriately targeted out servicing and CSCs. Within six kilometres of the Adelaide CBD there are three CSCs, at Norwood (3.37km), Torrensville (2.82km) and Enfield (5.68km). Customers who visit the Adelaide CSC are advised of the changes and letters have been sent to customers who will be allocated to new offices advising them of those new arrangements.Centrelink will relocate the Career Information Centre to Naylor House in Pulteney Street, Adelaide.</DOC>

Â No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprentices. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will continue to liaise closely with all stakeholders in the coming months regarding future arrangements.How has their performance rated against the five key performance indicators in the 2006-09 contract?The Australian Apprenticeships Support Services (AASS) Contract 2006-2009 has five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
KPI 1 - Accuracy
The data below is based on the monitoring periods that have been finalised to date. This includes the monitoring periods from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008. This data has been consolidated to provide the average national outcome.BenchmarkNational averageMeasure A - Overall accuracy in the administration of AASS96%98%Measure B - Training contracts processed within 10 day turnaround90%87%Measure C - Claims processed within 10 day turnaround90%90%Measure D - Advice letters processed within 10 day turnaround90%81%Measure E - Accuracy of assessments for incentives eligibility90%97%Â 
KPI 2 - Satisfaction Level
The satisfaction survey measures the level of satisfaction of employers and Australian Apprentices with Australian Apprenticeships Centres service delivery. The data below has been consolidated to provide the average national outcome.2008 data has not yet been finalised and is therefore unavailable at this stage.
KPI 3 - Marketing and Promotion
KPI 3 is a qualitative measure of how satisfactorily each Australian Apprenticeships Centre has met or not met the intended marketing and promotion objectives and strategies as detailed in their annual Business Activity Report.Â 
KPI 4 - Key Priority Groups
Servicing Key Priority Groups (including Indigenous Australians,people with a disability, Australian School-based Apprenticeships andmature aged workers); andSkills shortage Occupations Business Plan.RatingKey Priority Groups97% of contracted provider results were rated as satisfactorySkills Shortage95% of contracted provider results were rated as satisfactoryÂ 
KPI 5 - Retention and Completion Rates
KPI 5 is based on completed monitoring periods up to 31 December 2007 only. This is due to the time lag between commencing and reaching the six month point of an Australian Apprenticeship. Consequently retention is always reported one or two monitoring periods after the commencement date. The benchmarks for retention and completion rates are based on the historical rates as at 30 June 2005.For the retention measure, 86% of Australian Apprenticeships Centre contracts have achieved within 10% of their benchmark or above.For the completion measure, 94% of Australian Apprenticeships Centre contracts have achieved their benchmark or above.(3)Â Â  What funding will the Government provide for Australian Apprenticeships Centres from 1 January 2010?The Australian Government is currently considering the future arrangements for Australian Apprenticeships Support Services in line with exploring strengthening linkages and pursuing better alignment of servicing arrangements for Australian Apprenticeships.No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprenticeships. The Department will continue to liaise closely with all stakeholders in the coming months regarding future arrangements.(4)Â Â  Does the Government plan to transfer responsibility for the Australian Apprenticeships Centres to the State and Territory Governments?No decision has been made regarding future arrangements for support services for Australian Apprenticeships.(5)Â Â  Has any funding within the National Skills and Workforce Development COAG Agreement been allocated to the Australian Apprenticeships Centres, or a body fulfilling a similar role?The National Skills and Workforce Development COAG Agreement does not allocate funding for support services for Australian Apprenticeships.</DOC>

The DEEWR Annual Report 2007-2008 (Table P3.6, page 260) shows that 1286 people separated from the former DEST, former DEWR and DEEWR between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2008. The report indicates that a considerable proportion of these separations (355 or approximately 28%) were initiated by the Department, mainly through the expiry of non-ongoing employment contracts.The majority of the balance of separations (916 or approximately 71%) were initiated by staff.DEEWR's voluntary staff turnover for the 2007-2008 year was 16.61%. This result places DEEWR between the median (12.83%) and the 75th percentile (17.58%) of a benchmark of a number of Federal Government agencies (Infohrm HR Benchmarking Program).While this rate is slightly higher than the department's target range, it is not unexpected given the level of organisational change over the past 12 months. DEEWR continues to monitor voluntary staff turnover and has a range of strategies to ensure we retain the workforce capability required to deliver our business including:an attractive and flexible set of employment terms and conditionsa performance management system that engages and supports all staff to achieve their full potentialrecruitment and orientation processes that are effective in bringing new staff into the organisationpromoting strong employee engagement through improved leadership and enhanced career and learning opportunities.</DOC>

The increase to DEEWR staffing levels from 30 June 2007 was the result of the creation of the new department which combined three distinct entities: the Department of Education, Science and Training; the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations; and the youth and child care function from the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. DEEWR expects its staffing levels to reduce during the 2008-09 financial year as a result a number of government decisions including the decision to increase the efficiency dividend from 1.25 per cent to 3.25 per cent. DEEWR is not expecting to offer redundancies as a result of the efficiency dividend.</DOC>

The former Department of Employment and Workplace Relations commenced a project in December 2006 to transition to Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) technology over a period of approximately 12 months with expected savings and improvements in administration and support of the Department's telephony system. Savings from the project were expected to accrue only after full implementation which was planned to be completed early in the 2008/09 financial year. Due to the machinery of government changes and the resulting merger of the Department with the Department of Education, Science and Training, the scope of project has increased and the project is now scheduled for completion in the 2009/10 financial year. The Department anticipates that savings from the deployment of this technology will now begin to accrue during the 2009/10 financial year. Based on original estimates, these savings are expected to be approximately $800K per annum over the costs of maintaining the Department's traditional telephony systems.</DOC>

A significant body of work has been undertaken in the last 20 years that has quantified the impacts of poor water quality on marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs. The main contaminants affecting these marine communities are excess nutrients, sediments and pesticides. The reef communities don't distinguish where these contaminants come from, just that there are too much of them. A synthesis of this research was released recently at the Reef Summit to support the latest Scientific Consensus Statement. This report highlights again that agricultural run-off contributes the bulk of the contaminants entering the Great Barrier Reef.Green Cane Harvesting indeed improved protection of soil from erosion. Coral coring research undertaken by the University of Queensland in 2007 in the Mackay Whitsunday region indicates a reduction in sediment being incorporated into the coral skeletons in this area with the widespread introduction of this practice in the mid 1990s. However this practice does not affect either nutrient or pesticide applications, which are not activities associated with harvesting. These are activities associated with planting and growing crops and so have not been reduced by Green Cane Harvesting in any significant manner.A number of assessments have been published in the last 5 years, including most recently the Scientific Consensus Statement on Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef, and all are consistent in their findings. Between 80 and 90% of the loads of sediment, nutrients and pesticides entering the Great Barrier Reef come from diffuse sources in agricultural lands.The Government has supported a range of actions to address the improvement of water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. For example, by far the largest urban source is nutrient output from sewage treatment plants. The Government has been supporting the upgrading of urban sewage treatment facilities in Queensland, from secondary to tertiary treatment (that is removing nutrients), for many years and strongly supports Queensland's policy, which requires the upgrade of all coastal sewage treatment plants to this high standard by 2010. Further the Government is providing $200m through its Reef Rescue package, over the next 5 years, to support on-ground-actions to improve water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, much of which will be targeted at supporting farmers improve their practices. The Government has been supporting the Queensland Wetland Program for the last 4 years, which has included around $8m for on-ground works, like riparian rehabilitation you describe. Further financial support for this important work is earmarked in grants recently announced to Regional Natural Resource Management Bodies this year.Quite the contrary, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not made any claims in recent times suggesting the overall health of the Great Barrier Reef has improved. While it is true that by world standards the Great Barrier Reef is arguably the best managed and healthiest system in the world, this is a relative situation. It is true that some aspects of reef health have improved following the rezoning in 2004, including the bounce back of some specific fish species. However, the Authority's view is that the Great Barrier Reef remains under significant pressure. This in particular relates to the growing impacts induced by global climate change and the impacts from poor land practices driving a decline in water quality, which underpins the health and resilience of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. This is why the Government has recognised the importance of addressing this insidious problem and is investing significant resources through programs like Caring for Our country.Again I reiterate that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not made any such claim. I would direct Mr Katter to the most recent publication by the Authority on the Climate Change and the Great Barrier Reef - a Vulnerability Assessment to answer his question on the depth of the Authority's concern with regard to the pressures on the long term health of the Great Barrier Reef. The publication is available on the GBRMPA web site and hard copies are available upon request to the GBRMPA.</DOC>

The government is committed to strengthening community safety and improving the protection of children and has introduced income management in the Northern Territory to ensure payments intended to benefit children are used exactly for that purpose.Income management only applies to certain welfare and family payments, as specified under Part 3B of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. Payments from Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) are not relevant payments under Part 3B, so under current legislation, income management does not apply to CDEP wages.
However, under the proposed CDEP program reform model, new CDEP participants from 1 July 2009 would access CDEP while on income support, and would therefore be subject to income management where appropriate.
Participants on CDEP at 30 June 2009 would continue to receive CDEP wages, subject to CDEP continuing and to participants remaining eligible for the program and not having a break from CDEP for more that two consecutive weeks after 1 July 2009. CDEP wages would continue to be available until 30 June 2011 with participants being transitioned off CDEP wages over the three months after that date.
As currently proposed, CDEP would only be offered in remote regions - that is in areas where there is not an established economy. Participants in areas where CDEP would cease would be transitioned to income support, subject to eligibility, and so would receive intensive assistance through the new Employment Services to help them to get and keep jobs.

In preparation for implementation of the Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure, the Government is currently negotiating protocols with representatives from the Northern Territory and Western Australian trial jurisdictions for the provision of information to Centrelink in relation to those children who are failing to attend school and whose parents are failing to take reasonable steps to ensure their children are attending school.The Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Schooling Requirements) Bill 2008 provides that a state or territory or a non-government school authority or any other person who is responsible for the operation of one or more schools may give the Commonwealth information about the enrolment/non-enrolment or attendance/non-attendance of children at school. Under the relevant section of the legislation, information about schooling can be provided despite any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a state or territory.Negotiations are currently underway with trial jurisdictions to establish bilateral agreements for implementation of the measure from the beginning of the 2009 school year.Centrelink will not be providing wholesale data to schools about parents who are in receipt of income support. Where they perceive it to be appropriate, schools or education authorities will liaise with Centrelink on specific children who are not attending school to the satisfaction of the school or education authority and whose parent(s) are not taking reasonable steps to ensure their children attend school. Centrelink will advise whether the parent receives income support and is therefore subject to the measure.Under the measure, parents receiving a variety of Commonwealth income support payments who live in a trial location and have children of compulsory school age will be contacted by Centrelink and required to provide enrolment information. This information can be provided by phone, in person or by completing a form. Those parents who fail to provide enrolment information to Centrelink without a reasonable excuse will be required to engage with Centrelink and will be offered social worker assistance.The measure provides for the temporary withholding of a parent's income support payment if the parent has failed to meet their requirements; despite repeated attempts by Centrelink and education authorities to assist the parent and in the absence of any reasonable excuse or special circumstance. Once parents meet their requirements within a 13 week period, their payments will be restored with full back pay. It is only after a minimum of 13 weeks of suspended payments that a parent may have their payments cancelled, and thus 'lose payments'.The measure provides for multiple contacts by Centrelink staff and Centrelink social workers with parents to offer them support; with the aim of enabling parents to meet their requirements and thereby avoid any suspension of payments. It is expected that very few parents will have their payment cancelled.</DOC>

Under the measure, state/territory education authorities can ask Centrelink for assistance where the education authority believes that a child is failing to attend school to the satisfaction of that state or territory as required by the law of that state or territory.Under existing arrangements, education authorities are responsible for monitoring children's attendance at school. Where an attendance issue is identified, it is anticipated that the education authority will draw on existing practices to attempt to resolve the issue. If the attempts to resolve the issue are unsuccessful, the education authority could consider whether a referral to Centrelink under the measure would be helpful.</DOC>

The Economic Security Strategy (ESS) Payment announced by the Government on14 October 2008 provided $3.9 billion in support payments to low and middle income families. In order to ensure that payments were made before Christmas in most cases, eligible families received their payments in line with existing payment arrangements. In all, around 3.9 million Australian children benefited from the $1,000 ESS payment. A further $4.8 billion was paid to Australia's 4 million pensioners, carers and seniors providing them with immediate financial help in the lead up to comprehensive reform of the pension system.
The Government helps to support and strengthen families through the provision of early intervention services to enhance family relationships, assist in problem solving, prevent family breakdown and resolve conflict around separation, provide support to families of drug users and reduce family violence, particularly in indigenous communities.
The Government is committed to protecting the health and safety of children and that is why those customers in our communities who are subject to income management have their ESS payment income managed at 100%. This is consistent with current arrangements for lump sum payments under income management. People will be able to discuss with Centrelink as to how they want to allocate the funding towards meeting priority needs and other non-prohibited expenditures.
Income management of these payments will help prevent a sudden flow of cash towards prohibited items such as alcohol, drugs, tobacco, gambling and pornography.

Yes.Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Iraq, recommended on 2 October 2008, that twelve seats be guaranteed for minority groups in Iraqi provincial elections. The Government of Iraq recently announced it would guarantee six seats in provincial governments for Christian and other minorities.There have been media reports that Iraqi Christians have demonstrated.The Government of Iraq announced on 8 November that it would guarantee six seats in provincial governments for Christian and other minorities, in the provinces of Baghdad, Ninewa and Basra, which would be contested in the provincial elections to be held on 31 January 2009.The Australian Government is aware of media reports of violence towards Christian groups in Mosul, but is not aware of information linking attacks against minorities to the removal of Article 50.The Australian Government does not have information on this.Electoral arrangements in Iraq are a matter for the democratically elected Government of Iraq to determine. Australia continues to urge the Iraqi Government to do all it can to protect the human rights of all Iraqis. I raised Australia's concerns about the protection of human rights of minority groups, including Christians, in Iraq when I met Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Salih, in Baghdad on 10 June 2008. The Government continues to monitor developments in human rights in Iraq and has instructed the Australian Embassy in Baghdad to take all appropriate opportunities to raise our concerns about violence against minorities. As part of ongoing efforts, on 18 November 2008 the Australian Ambassador called on the Minister of Human Rights, Wydan Mikha'il Salim, to express Australia's concerns regarding the security of Iraq's minority groups.There are no definitive, reliable figures on the size of the Christian population in Iraq. Assyrian Christians in Iraq have suffered significantly over recent years, including through major displacement from their homes, as have other minority communities in Iraq.The Australian Government remains concerned about violence in Iraq and persecution of minority groups. The Iraqi Constitution describes rights and protections for Iraq's minorities. Despite this, extremist groups in Iraq have continued attacks on minorities.As I said in response to question seven, Australia continues to urge the Iraqi Government to do all it can to protect the human rights of all Iraqis. I raised Australia's concerns about the protection of human rights of minority groups, including Christians, in Iraq when I met Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Salih, in Baghdad on 10 June 2008. The Government continues to monitor developments in human rights in Iraq and has instructed the Australian Embassy in Baghdad to take all appropriate opportunities to raise our concerns about violence against minorities. As part of ongoing efforts, on 18 November 2008 the Australian Ambassador called on the Minister of Human Rights, Wydan Mikha'il Salim, to express Australia's concerns regarding the security of Iraq's minority groups.The Australian Government remains committed to supporting Iraqis in need, including minorities. On 19 December 2008 I announced the Australian Government would provide $1 million to assist Christian and other minority groups in Ninewa Province, Northern Iraq, who had been the victims of recent outbreaks of sectarian violence. That assistance will be provided through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Medical Corps (IMC). It will fund emergency provisions, medical support, reconstruction efforts and the tracking of families who have fled into neighbouring countries. This funding brings the total humanitarian assistance provided by the Australian Government to Ninewa Province to $3 million.Australia is already providing $2 million through the IMC to assist Iraqis in Ninewa Province who have suffered from violence. This funding is going towards emergency medical training, women's centres and mental health services for primary school age children.The Government is providing an additional $10 million to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's Displaced Persons Program to assist Iraqis in neighbouring and transit countries. This funding will assist international organisations and NGOs to maintain protection space (i.e. access to asylum, humanitarian assistance and protection) and enable Iraqis outside Iraq to settle with security and dignity pending long term resolution. This is part of Australia's overall assistance program to Iraq, worth $165 million over the next three years. Australia is also assisting Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) through its immigration program. The Government has increased the size of the 2008-2009 Humanitarian Program by 500 places, specifically for Iraqis. Iraqis are likely to be the single largest national group of entrants under the Humanitarian Program during 2008-09.</DOC>

The Government considered the impact of the Economic Security Strategy payments on remote indigenous communities. In communities where income management was in place payments were managed through that process. That is, 100% of the lump sum was income managed.Income management covered both income support and family payments for those who met the relevant eligibility criteria.The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs worked at a state and local level to ensure service providers and government agencies working in communities were aware of the payments and made arrangements appropriate to that community.The Government has managed the Economic Security Strategy payments through income management rather than instalment.People eligible for the Economic Security Strategy payments that were subject to income management in the Northern Territory, and the Cape York and the Western Australia Child Protection initiative, at the time of payment, have had their Economic Security Strategy payments income managed.People who were income managed negotiated with Centrelink as to how they wanted to allocate the funding towards meeting priority needs and other non-prohibited expenditures.The purpose of the Economic Security Strategy is to boost the Australian economy. The Government made a decision to achieve this through targeted lump sum payments.</DOC>

A number of organisations produce records of global average surface temperatures. The most prominent data sets areHadCRUT3, produced by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and the Hadley Centre in the UK Meteorological Office;NASA-GISS, produced by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies; andNOAA-NCDC, produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Centre (USA).Temperature estimates of layers of the atmosphere are also produced by several organisations. These include the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperature estimates produced by Remote Sensing Systems with support from NASA and the University of Alabama, USA. Weather balloon-based temperature analyses are produced by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and the Hadley Centre in the UK Meteorological Office as well as by NOAA-NCDC.(2)Â Â  These primary records show sustained warming trends from the surface to the lower layer of the atmosphere (troposphere) with cooling above.In two of the data sets of global average surface temperatures, HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS, the linear trend over the interval 1998-2008 is one of warming. Absolute differences between the temperatures in the specific years 1998 and 2008 for the HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS data sets are -0.202 and  - 0.150 oC, respectively.The NOAA-NCDC data set has not yet been updated to include 2008, but the interval 1998-2007 displays a warming trend. The absolute difference between temperatures in the specific years 1998 and 2007 is -0.027 oC.For the NASA-GISS data set, the linear trend for the period 2001-2008 is one of warming, whereas HadCRUT3 shows cooling over this period. Absolute differences between 2001 and 2008 for the HadCRUT3 and NASA-GISS data sets are -0.087 and 0.000Â oC, respectively.The NOAA-NCDC data set displays a warming trend for the period 2001-2007. The absolute difference between temperatures in 2001 and 2007 is +0.056 oC.The variation in trends is primarily due to the differences in spatial averaging techniques used to calculate the global average temperature.Trends seen in global surface temperature over short periods, such as from 1998 to the present, are not good indicators of longer term climate change. At short time scales, trends are strongly affected by year-to-year variability and by the start and end of times chosen. In 1998 and 2002, the Earth's temperature was exceptionally hot because of El NiÃ±o events, and a La NiÃ±a event caused colder temperatures in 2000 and 2007. It is more robust to analyse data over many decades and climate scientists often use an 11-year moving average to remove short term variability from the record so that long term trends can be observed.(3)Â Â  (a)Â Â  (i)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  HadCRUT3, NOAA-NCDC and NASA-GISS all use land thermometer measurements. Sea surface temperature measurements are made on ships and buoys.(ii)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There are versions of these data sets that also incorporate satellite measurements, but the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report avoided using these data sets, since there is not a long history of satellite measurements, ie no measurements prior to 1979.(b)Â Â  Urban heat island effects are real but localised, and have not biased large scale trends in the global surface temperature. The effect of urbanisation on the land-based temperature record is neglible because the local effects are avoided or accounted for in the data sets used. Over the oceans there is clearly no urban heat island effect. Hence, the potential for urban heat islands to affect global surface temperature estimates is very limited.
thermometers measure temperature directly; andthere is a long history (around 150 years) of reliable thermometer measurements, which can be compared to detect long term trends.Disadvantages of using land thermometers:some measurements in large cities must be adjusted to correct for urban heat island effects; andthere is limited data available from thermometers in the polar regions.Advantages of using satellites:satellites can provide temperature information for the ocean surface, which may supplement data from thermometers on ships and buoys;satellites also provide information about changes in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere; andsatellites provide almost global information rapidly.Disadvantages of using satellites:Satellites record data on radiation, which is an indirect measure of temperature;Disparities remain among different tropospheric (lower atmosphere) temperature trends estimated from satellites since 1979, and are still likely to contain residual errors, although estimates have been substantially improved through adjustments for issues such as changing satellites and orbits; andThe vertical resolution of historical satellite data is poor, meaning that it is not possible to fully isolate cooling of the stratosphere from warming in the troposphere.The temperature projections in the third and fourth assessment reports of the IPCC are, by their nature, multi-decadal projections in which the effects of internal climate variability on the decadal timescale are averaged out. It is therefore not meaningful to infer 'projections' over short time periods, such as December 1998 to the present or December 2001 to the present, from the published IPCC material.</DOC>

The national sporting organisations listed at Table A and the national sporting organisations for persons with a disability listed at Table B will be allocated Australian Sports Commission funding in 2009-10 which in part will be sourced from the additional funding announced in November 2008.Table A shows the indicative high performance sport grant to be allocated to each national sporting organisation for 2009-10. The Board of the Australian Sports Commission has yet to consider other funding programs for these organisations, and thus their complete grant allocations for 2009-10 have yet to be determined.The Board of the Australian Sports Commission is yet to consider funding allocations for national sporting organisations for persons with a disability for 2009-10.Table ANational Sporting Organisation Name2009/10 Indicative High Performance GrantArchery Australia$354,800Athletics Australia$3,579,600Australian Baseball Federation$1,347,000Australian Canoeing Incorporated$1,620,000Australian Fencing Federation$35,400Australian Football League$0Australian Ice Racing$83,000Australian International Shooting$1,349,800Australian Karate Federation$3,000Australian Lacrosse Association$0Australian Paralympic Committee *$3,320,000Australian Rugby League$0Australian Rugby Union$0Australian University Sport *$30,000Australian Volleyball Federation$1,286,000Australian Water Polo Inc$1,675,000Australian Waterski &amp; Wakeboard Federation$151,000Australian Weightlifting Federation$362,600Australian Wrestling Union$50,000Badminton Australia$185,000Basketball Australia$2,530,600Bicycle Motocross Australia$458,500Bocce Federation of Australia$26,000Bowls Australia$417,200Boxing Australia$141,000Confederation of Australian Motor Sport Ltd (CAMS)$304,200Cricket Australia$0Cycling Australia$3,403,000Diving Australia$761,800Equestrian Federation of Australia$1,439,000Football Federation Australia *$1,331,600Golf Australia$478,400Gymnastics Australia$1,174,000Hockey Australia$3,703,200Indoor Sports Australia Ltd (Indoor Cricket)$61,000Judo Federation of Australia$467,800Motorcycling Australia$382,600Netball Australia *$897,100Orienteering Australia$86,000Polocrosse Association of Australia$61,000Pony Club Australia$30,000Rowing Australia$3,746,600Skate Australia$0Ski &amp; Snowboard Australia$767,600Softball Australia$1,439,200Squash Australia$437,600Surf Life Saving Australia$355,400Surfing Australia$423,400Swimming Australia$4,265,000Table Tennis Australia$103,800Tennis Australia$0Tenpin Bowling Australia$80,000Touch Football Australia$120,000Triathlon Australia$878,600Yachting Australia$2,730,600* The amount shown does not include Special Purpose Grants provided to the sports noted - Australian Paralympic Committee $5,450,000; Australian University Sport $2,500,000; Football Federation $4,000,000; Netball Australia $400,000.Table BNational Sporting Organisation for Persons with a DisabilityAustralian Recreation Association for People with Intellectual Disabilities (AUSRAPID)Australian Athletes with a DisabilityAustralian Blind Sports FederationTransplant AustraliaSpecial Olympics AustraliaRiding for the Disabled Association of AustraliaDeaf Sports AustraliaDisabled Wintersport AustraliaÂ </DOC>

Yes. However I am uncertain of Mr Katter's source. There is a strong relationship between rural or regional location and participation in higher education, as shown in Table 1. The relationship for vocational education and training is less marked.

 ABS, Census of Population and Housing, 2006.*Due to methodological issues there may be differences between this data and total State and Australia data reported by the ABSYes. Economic factors are but some of the influences on higher education participation, and do not operate the same way in all locations. As important are local business and industry, family and student aspirations, job opportunities and lifestyle choices.(2)Â Â  Several Australian Government programs are in place that assist rural and regional students. These include Youth Allowance and Austudy, deferred payment arrangements for tuition costs through the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) and funding for Commonwealth Scholarships. The doubling of Commonwealth Scholarships from 44,000 to 88,000 by 2012, is directly focused on helping disadvantaged students, including those living in regional and remote areas, in better accessing higher education.(3)Â Â  I will not comment on specific proposals at this stage. Income support for students has been identified as a key issue in the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. The report from the Review was released recently by the Australian Government on 17Â December 2008. The Australian Government will consider the findings of the Review and respond in due course.</DOC>

The Australian Government is aware that the north of Australia has some of the largest tidal ranges in the world.Â  Barrage tidal power systems have been proposed in the Kimberley region of WesternÂ Australia since the 1960s.Â  The Australian Government has contributed funding to several studies that have examined this potential. (b)Â  Although the cost of high voltage transmission lines has reduced, the enormous distance is such that it is not at present cost effective to transport electricity from aÂ Kimberley tidal power plant to Australia's main electricity grid in the south east of the country.Â  The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Energy Technologies Perspectives (2008) publication reports that overhead transmission lines cost about $600 million per thousand kilometres.Â  In addition, it notes that transportation of electricity entails significant losses.A study of possible tidal energy options in the Derby region commissioned by the Western Australian Government in 2001 concluded the project was not cost effective.Â  Gas was consideredÂ the more competitive option and along with the significant geographical challenges andÂ environmental concerns of the project, tidal energy was considered unfeasible.The National Hydrogen Study completed in 2003 also specifically examined the potential to use the tidal resources in the Kimberley and concluded that cost of transmission to energy markets in Western Australia or the eastern states would be prohibitively expensive.The Australian Government is aware ofÂ one large scale tidal barrage energy plant currently operating in the world, inÂ La Rance in France, plus two relatively small-scale projects.Â  WhileÂ otherÂ plant proposals have been consideredÂ technically feasible, projects in Canada and the United States were not followed through due to cost and the impact on the environment.Â  In its 2008 publication Energy Technologies Perspectives the IEA noted 'The environmental impacts of dammed tidal energy projects are often unacceptable.'The Australian Government isÂ not pursuingÂ a World Heritage nomination of the Kimberley coast region at this time.Â  The Kimberley's national and international heritage valuesÂ are beingÂ examined, however,Â as part of the 'Strategic Assessment relating to the impacts of actions under the Plan for the Browse Basin Common User Liquefied Natural Gas Hub Precinct and associated activities' (Strategic Assessment). The Australian and Western AustralianÂ Governments agreedÂ in February 2008 to undertake this Strategic Assessment.Â Â In June 2008, the Australian Heritage Council (the Council) commenced a National Heritage assessment of the west Kimberley region. The Council is due to provide its assessmentÂ by June 2010.</DOC>

The Commonwealth Government will invest up to $195 million over 2008-09 and 2009-10 to support economic development in the East Kimberley region, under the Government's $4.7 billion Nation Building initiative. The investment is conditional on a joint assessment of the most effective infrastructure investments to meet the social and economic development needs of the region.The Commonwealth Government's investment will focus on social and common-use infrastructure such as, social services facilities, roads, ports and power. These infrastructure investments will increase the productive capacity of the region and build the long-term sustainability of region.</DOC>

The Australian Government places a high priority on addressing climate change and has a multi-faceted strategy that recognises that there is no single solution to this challenge.Â  Along with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, renewable energy is one of the four key areas of activity in the Government's climate change emissions reduction strategy.Â The Government is supporting the expansion of renewable energy through the Renewable Energy Target, which will provide for 20 per cent of Australia's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2020.Â  While this will provide encouragement to investment in renewable generation, including hydro-electric projects, final decisions as to the appropriate choice of generation options is a matter for the commercial judgement of the sector.</DOC>

I approved a proposal from the Director of National Parks seeking the re-introduction of a park use fee for Kakadu National Park at $25 per adult, with residents of the Northern Territory exempt, and an implementation date of 1 April 2010. The Director's submission advised of resolutions of the Kakadu Board of Management supporting the re-introduction of a park use fee at this level, consultations with the Kakadu Board's Tourism Consultative Committee, and the assessment of the Director that $25 was an appropriate level for a Kakadu park use fee. The submission also considered alternative revenue stream options for the park, given the Government's statement in the 2008 Budget that alternative income stream options for Kakadu would be considered. Comparable data from other national parks and visitor attractions was also provided.The Kakadu Tourism Consultative Committee comprises representatives of the tourism industry and was established by the Kakadu Board of Management to provide direct communication with the tourism industry working in the park. The reintroduction of a park use fee was discussed at two meetings of the Tourism Consultative Committee in 2008 where there was general acceptance of the need to re-introduce a park use fee, that $25 was a reasonable level for such a fee, and that an adequate lead time was required so the industry could adjust rates and marketing materials. Some members suggested that NT residents should be exempt from the fee. The Director also consulted the Departments of Finance and Deregulation and Resources, Energy and Tourism before finalising his recommendations. My staff consulted with representatives of the Northern Territory Government, as well as the offices of Federal Government Members and Government Senators from the Northern Territory. All expressed concern about the reintroduction of the entrance fee, particularly if it was to apply to Northern Territory residents.see (2).Research on the price elasticity of demand for fees to Kakadu was considered as well as more general research from the CRC for Sustainable Tourism. This research showed that international visitors are the least price elastic to park fees, interstate visitors are slightly more elastic and local visitors are the most elastic. This is largely attributable to the proportion of the fee as part of the overall trip cost for each segment of traveller. As the majority of visitors to the park (approximately 85 per cent) are international or interstate visitors, it was considered that the impact of the fee on visitor numbers would be negligible.In 2004, 131,181 park use tickets were sold, but this does not include visitors under 16 years old. A calibrated pedestrian counter at the Bowali visitor centre indicated that 169,955 visitors passed through the Visitor Centre in 2004; however not all visitors stop at the Visitor Centre;In 2005, following the abolition of fees, ticket sales were no longer a measure of visitor numbers, and a new vehicle monitoring system was introduced, recording vehicles entering the park, with quarterly calibration surveys to determine vehicle occupancy and purpose of visit. This methodology indicated that 202,507 people visited the park that year;in 2006, 209,506 visitors;in 2007, 225,576 visitors;in 2008, 222,165 (to 30 November).in 2008-09 nil, as the measure is being introduced on 1 April 2010in 2009-10 $1.169m exclusive of GST;in 2010-11 $3.897m exclusive of GST;in 2011-12. $3.897m exclusive of GSTto (e) Budgets are not defined by calendar year. Financial data for Kakadu is provided annually in the Director of National Parks' Annual Reports for the preceding financial year. The budget forecast for Kakadu in 2008-09 is $22.019 million. Forecasts for subsequent years have not yet been defined.The budget for Kakadu for 2009-10 has not yet been defined. It will be developed between May and June 2009 and will take into consideration the reintroduction of the park use fee as well as any outcomes from the 2009-10 budget process.The budget for Kakadu did not include an allocation for tourist promotion in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 or 2008-09. In March 2005 the Australian Government provided $500,000 in supplementary funding for a cooperative marketing campaign for Kakadu with the Northern Territory Government in response to the release of the Kakadu A Shared Vision for Tourism report. Budget forecasts have not yet been defined at the park level for 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12.There are no plans to increase the entrance fee.

For the period between 1 November 2007 and 1 November 2008, 1544 formal warnings were issued and 165 sanctions imposed on sponsors for breaches of the sponsorship undertakings (noting a sponsor may have received more than one warning over this period and that warnings or sanctions may be imposed as a result of more than one breach).The types of non-compliance are in relation to:Non-cooperation with monitoring within the required timeframes.Not notifying the department of cessation of employment within 5 working days.Failure to meet the Minimum Salary Level.Employing a person in breach of immigration laws.Not complying with workplace relations laws.Not notifying of changes of circumstances and /or information affecting the businesses capacity to meet its undertakings.Not working in the nominated occupation.Not making Superannuation contributions.Not deducting tax instalments.Providing false and misleading information.For the period 1 November 2007 through to the end of the 2007/2008 financial year there was an increase in detected instances of non-compliance by Subclass 457 sponsors of their sponsorship obligations.Â  New monitoring policy has given particular emphasis to improved analysis and targeting of sponsors operating in high risk areas of the program, such as the construction, manufacturing and hospitality sectors.Â  The increase in the number of detected instances of non-compliance by Subclass 457 sponsors over this period suggests that the Department's risk profiling is correct.The first four months of the 2008/2009 financial year has seen a gradual decrease in detected instances of non-compliance by Subclass 457 sponsors.Â  This suggests that the Department's focus on awareness raising, education, promoting compliance with employer's sponsorship obligations and rectifying identified breaches is having an impact.</DOC>

I met with representatives on Taekwondo Australia on 1 December 2008. (b) I have not had a Sports Taekwondo Australia meeting.I have not had any contact with the World Taekwondo Federation.There were no grants provided to National Sporting Organisations for the sport of Taekwondo in the 2007-08 or 2008-09 financial years and consequently there is no acquittal necessary. All high performance costs associated with the preparation of the Olympic squad for Taekwondo were provided through the AIS program budget.There is currently no recognised National Sports Organisation for Taekwondo in Australia.Before any organisation can be recognised as a National Sporting Organisation by the Australian Sports Commission, a necessary first step would be to satisfy the Australian Sports Commission recognition criterion requiring membership of the sports international body. Pending membership of the sports international body any organisation seeking Australian Sports Commission recognition would need to make an application for recognition against all the Commission's recognition criteria, which are publicly available on the Commission's website www.ausport.gov.auThe Australian Olympic Committee is an independent body not funded by the Australian Government. Membership of the Australian Olympic Committee is a matter for the Australian Olympic Committee.There are a number of governance issues that have been identified as a result of the Taekwondo whole of sport review completed by the Australian Sports Commission in 2007. A full copy of this review was provided to representatives of Taekwondo Australia.The Australian Sports Commission met with the representatives of Taekwondo Australia on 1 December 2008 to discuss the key governance issues to be addressed by the sport.The Australian Sports Commission has since written to Taekwondo Australia confirming these requirements. While there are a significant number of recommendations in the Australian Sports Commission review, the major governance issues relate to:- democratic membership and voting structures;- independence of Board members;- the ability and authority for the elected Board to appropriately lead the sport; and- an ongoing commitment to cultural reform.I have requested that the Australian Sports Commission continue to provide advice and support to Taekwondo Australia to resolve their governance issues.</DOC>

The trend in migration related inquiries has been varied with an overall increase. Call volumes have remained relatively static onshore but increases of up to 22 per cent have been experienced offshore. Attachment A1 refers. Migration related calls appear to have decreased marginally as a percentage of overall call volumes. Pre-lodgement email inquiries regarding skilled migration reduced by 19 percent in 2007-08. Some of the reduction may be due to better access to information through industry outreach activities including regular information sessions, seminars, workshops. Participant attendance at these is averaging 22 per session and more than 30 sessions are occurring per month. Access to information through the department's web site may also be a factor.Web site inquiries have increased by approximately 25 per cent in the past twelve months with the daily average page views in November 2008 reaching 668 556. The top ten global access points are Australia (31.9%), United Kingdom (6.3%), United States (5.5%), India (4.5%), Sri Lanka (2.5%), China (2.3%), Philippines (1.7%), Canada (1.3%), New Zealand (1.2%) and both Germany and Singapore (1.1% each). The newly launched visa wizard which provides visa application information to clients via the website is averaging 5200 views daily during the week and 4017 daily over weekends.Application rates for skilled migration since 1 July 2008 have averaged 11 750 per month. There was a spike in application rates ahead of the reforms which came into effect in September 2007. Skilled migration applications rates then fell to approximately 10 010 per month before steadily increasing to the current level.Application rates for family migration since 1 July 2008 have averaged 8050 per month which is approximately 7.3 percent less than the average in 2007/08.Detailed information on processing performance against service standards broken down by post and visa category is at Attachment A2. The number of applications lodged by post and visa category since 1 July 2008 is also shown.Attachment A1 - Client Enquiry DataDIAC operates two onshore contact centres in Melbourne and Sydney and two offshore contact centres located in London and Ottawa. The London Contact Centre (LCC) handles calls from the UK and Ireland. The Ottawa Contact Centre (OCC) handles calls from Canada, the USA, the Caribbean and parts of South America. In addition, data for the DIAC office in Shanghai post has been included to give an indication of volume for the China region.The onshore and offshore contact centres report slightly differently on the categories of visa classes they handle due to their particular client service focus in that region.The data below represents client selection when they enter the IVR and is not always indicative of the actual enquiry. The nationality of the caller is captured in Ottawa only.The department only offers an email channel to clients enquiring about General Skilled Migration.Onshore Call DataVisitor Visa enquiries make up more than a quarter of all enquiries to the onshore DIAC Contact Centres, closely followed by Residence, Students and Business. There has been little variation from 06/07 to 07/08 with less than a 1% increase in call volume and very little difference in the distribution of calls to the different visa categories.Visa Category2006-072007-08DifferenceVisitors27.3%26.2%-1.1%Students20.5%22.8%+2.3%Residence21.4%23.2%+1.8%Skilled10.3%8.3%-2%Business20.5%22.8%+2.3%Parental (POPC)0.8%1.3%+0.5%Â Onshore Email Data (pre-lodgement enquiries)Visa Category2006-072007-08DifferenceSkilled4116133284-19%Â Offshore Call DataLondon Contact CentreVisitor Visa enquiries make up a large proportion of calls to the London Contact Centre at nearly half of visa enquiries for 07/08.

Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs), a type of non-incandescent lamp, are currently the most energy efficient and cost effective form of lighting for many applications in the home and or office. All fluorescent lamps including CFLs contain very small amounts of elemental mercury. Government and industry continue to work together to minimise the mercury content. A new standard will be introduced for CFLs that includes a maximum mercury content aligned with the European Commission standard of fiveÂ milligrams (one two-hundredth of a gram) per bulb. The ordinary fluorescent tubes in current use contain approximately 15 milligrams of mercury per tube, consistent with the Australian Standard. These have been used safely in most commercial and public buildings in Australia and around the world for over 40 years.To put the amount of mercury contained in CFLs in context, five milligrams would fit on the tip of a ball point pen. The old mercury thermometers contain approximately 500 milligrams of mercury. With appropriate precautions regarding disposal in place, elemental mercury continues to be used safely in a variety of products including lamps, watch batteries, various medical instruments, and dental fillings.It is important to note that CFLs are not being mandated. More efficient forms of incandescent lighting will continue to be available, such as mains voltage halogen lamps. Mains voltage halogens have a very similar appearance to the traditional incandescent light bulb, do not contain mercury, can be used in all of the same fittings, and are readily available. The halogen gas they contain allows them to operate at a higher temperature, which results in higher efficiency levels. However, mains voltage halogens are not as energy efficient as CFL alternatives.The mercury contained in a CFL is sealed within the glass tubing of the lamp and can only be released if the glass is broken. Scientific investigations into the potential risks of mercury exposure from an accidentally broken CFL report, that for the average person poisoning is very unlikely because of the very small amounts involved.The recommended precautionary guidelines for the safe clean-up and disposal of broken CFLs is available at:http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/energyefficiency/lighting.html#disposal.The concentration of mercury vapour released by a broken CFL, when measured directly above the broken lamp, can transiently exceed international guidelines for chronic exposure in ambient (outdoor) air. The term 'chronic' implies that the exposure is continuous over an extended period i.e. years. It is not appropriate to use these chronic guideline values when assessing possible risk from short term exposure. Moreover, the amount of mercury likely to be inhaled as a result of being near a broken CFL or cleaning one up is only a fraction of the average daily dietary mercury intake as identified by the National Health and Medical Research Council.While considered to be low, previous overseas research to assess the risk of mercury exposure from fluorescent lamps to waste collectors, processors and landfill workers, indicates that the concentration of mercury in air is unlikely to reach dangerous levels in these situations. Occupational Health and Safety requirements in each state and territory work to protect all workers and we would expect these to be applied to assist workers in the safe handling of all waste.Mercury is among the most bio-concentrated trace metals in the food chain. It is a naturally occurring metal found in small quantities throughout the environment in both the atmosphere and in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In a 2005 study conducted by the Department of Health and Aging, gaps were identified in our understanding of how mercury interacts with ecosystems, including how it is retained in an ecosystem and how much atmospherically-deposited mercury is transported into ecosystems.As a global pollutant, an accurate knowledge of the amounts of mercury released worldwide and from all sources is an important input into models of mercury distribution in the global environment, and in the formulation of effective control strategies. The Australian Government has commissioned work to properly analyse mercury sources, transportation and fate as well as current regulatory and voluntary measures related to mercury in Australia. The information gathered in this process will be used to assist in developing an international approach to the issue of mercury. The next meeting of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Working Group on mercury will occur in October 2008. A meeting of the UNEP Governing Council will follow in February 2009, where international discussions on how to approach the issue of mercury on a global scale will continue.When taking into consideration the total amount of mercury emitted from both incandescent light bulbs and CFLs over the life of the lamps, less mercury is released into the environment from the use of CFLs than incandescent lamps even though CFLs contain mercury. This is because burning coal to produce electricity releases mercury. Because CFLs use only about twenty percent of the electricity which incandescent bulbs use to produce the same amount of light, only about twenty percent of the coal needs to be burnt and so only about twenty percent of the amount of mercury is released.In June 2007 the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) decided to investigate issues associated with the disposal of CFLs. Work is continuing with the Australian Council of Recyclers and other industry and government stakeholders, gathering information on the nature and extent of problems associated with the disposal of fluorescent lamps that contain mercury. EPHC has sought advice on whether waste CFLs should be listed as a priority waste for national action, and expects to consider this advice at the first EPHC meeting in 2009. Depending on EPHC's assessment of the need, some form of product stewardship scheme may be implemented. Such a scheme would aim to safely recover mercury from CFLs or otherwise dispose of CFLs more safely.At present however, most CFLs are domestic waste and are disposed of to landfill. A large number of landfills impose higher charges for commercial quantities of fluorescent lamps (generally fluorescent tubes) or only accept domestic quantities of mercury containing lamps for landfilling. As a result commercial quantities of fluorescent lamps are increasingly being recycled. The ACT Government has recently announced the provision of drop off collection points for lamps in order to facilitate their recycling. Some states also have similar schemes and some major retailers are also providing drop off-points</DOC>

to (6)The $22 million is a payment to be spent on verified operating losses plus related head office costs, incurred by identified loss making ABC centres between 6 November and 31 December 2008 in order to assist these centres to provide ongoing care for children at these centres. The amount represented the best estimate available as at the beginning of the Receivership as to the projected losses at the then identified loss making ABC centres, as advised by the banking syndicate of ABC. The funding is not a gift and conditions governing the funding are determined in a contract between the Commonwealth and the Receiver. The Government is not making any payments under contract without first having the claimed losses independently verified by DEEWR's appointed insolvency advisers, PPB.to (8) 31 December 2008 reflected the outcome of discussions with ABC's Receiver and banking syndicate and provided time for the Receiver to conduct a review of ABC's circumstances which in turn informed further consideration of the ABC matter during this period. Since the member placed her Question on Notice further announcements by the Receiver have identified which centres are unviable under the ABC business model and which are to be retained in the ABC business. There are a range of reasons why centres may be unprofitable such as lease costs, occupancy, staff costs and revenue.to (12) ABC Learning Centres have been meeting the requirements of section 21 of the Child Care Benefit (Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval) Determination 2000 and reporting their vacancy information to the Child Care Access Hotline (CCAH). The Child Care Industry Taskforce is using all relevant administrative data to assist in its work. This information is protected under the Family Assistance Act and can only be used for the purposes specified in that Act. The Department conducts ongoing analysis of demographic and administrative data in order to ensure ongoing estimated potential demand for child care. This data is constantly updated to reflect changing demographics.and (16) Staff members from the Deputy Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations have met with peak child care associations, the Court Appointed Receiver over the ABC2 Group centres, the Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, and other interested parties.(15) and (17) The Government does not have responsibility for buying or selling the ABC childcare centres. The ABC Receiver McGrath Nicol has indicated that at this stage there is no sale process for the 720 centres that are subject to its receivership but that interested parties will be notified if and when that position should change. Centres subject to the oversight of the Court Appointed Receivers, PPB, are included in an Expression of Interest process which commenced in January 2009. PPB will have regard to selection criteria provided by the Government.The Government was well aware of the possible social and economic impact of the potential closure at short notice of a large number of ABC Learning Centres when deciding on short term funding to ensure centres remain open until at least 31 March 2009 while alternative arrangements are made.The Australian Government is carefully considering child care market developments in the priority locations announced for the early learning and care centre initiative and how best to deliver early learning and care in these locations. The remaining 222 centres will be considered in light of this experience and also once the child care operators have settled. The Australian Government will work with the states and territories to ensure that the remaining up to 222 centres are established in areas of highest unmet demand.</DOC>

CDEP in Brisbane and areas just north of Brisbane ceased on 1 July 2007 when CDEP was removed in urban and major regional areas.The new universal employment services will be the primary provider of services to Indigenous jobseekers in the communities of Taree and Kempsey from 1 July 2009. The reformed employment services will provide increased services for disadvantaged jobseekers, including many Indigenous people. The reformed and expanded Indigenous Employment Program will also be available to assist jobseekers.Officers of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (my Department) will be working closely with CDEP providers to determine the range of community services and businesses that have been structured to rely on CDEP. Where possible, alternative options for the continuation of services and alternative options for assisting businesses will be identified.Officers of my Department will assist in identifying alternative options for the continuation of community services. Businesses that currently rely on CDEP for the delivery of goods or services are encouraged to review their respective business and pricing models to increase revenue and reduce dependence on subsidised wages. Depending on the nature of the employment and training being provided by these organisations, alternative assistance may be available through other government programs such as those delivered through Indigenous Business Australia, elements of the reformed Indigenous Employment Program, traineeship schemes or other community grant programs.A new Community Support program will provide culturally appropriate support for Indigenous community members to link up/obtain referrals to a range of services (such as legal, funeral, health, family violence) and to access the internet and other resources. This program will be delivered separately from CDEP and will be available in urban and regional centres with significant Indigenous populations, including in locations with established economies where CDEP will cease from 1 July 2009.

Projects being funded in Victoria through The Living Murray initiative (TLM) and by Water for Rivers (WfR) are listed in Table 1.
Table 1
ProjectFunding SourceGrant Date1Funding ($M)Savings
 The grant date listed for TLM projects relate to the date Investment Agreements were signed for the particular commitment.Â  The grant date listed for Water for Rivers is the date the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments signed of the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed.Â  The Water for Rivers Company is responsible for the commercial arrangements to implement projects.Water recovered through The Living Murray initiative will not be available to send to Melbourne via the Sugarloaf Pipeline.We are advised by the Victorian Government that water savings achieved through the Central Goulburn Channel Automation project will be available to send to Melbourne up until Water for Rivers finalise payments, which is currently budgeted for 2010-11.This has not yet been determined.The conditions of approval imposed on the project require that the audit be conducted by a party independent of the Sugarloaf Pipeline Alliance.Â  As with all approval conditions imposed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, compliance will be assured through the Department's robust compliance and enforcement framework.Some Victorian Government agencies already play a role in the regulation of water within the Goulburn River system, and their involvement through the provision of information to the audit process may be appropriate.We expect that the Victorian Government will be assessing savings each year in order to identify the appropriate allocations to irrigators, to the environment and to Melbourne users.Condition 11(e) attached to the Approval Decision states that the Melbourne water extracted to the Sugarloaf Pipeline must be 'zero if the necessary regulated releases are for the maintenance of environmental flows or materially deplete water stored in Eildon Weir that is designated as being an environmental reserve'.The water quality reserve, part of which was previously sold to Coliban Water, is a separate allocation of water over and above the environmental flows or environmental reserve.Â  The water quality reserve is not the subject of any condition of approval.</DOC>

 (1) the Living Murray component of the Shepparton Modernisation Projects is only one part of a larger project; and (2) the Central Goulburn 1234 Modernisation (CG1234) project is not a Living Murray project.No water allocations identified for the Living Murray initiative or Water for Rivers will be diverted to Melbourne via the Sugarloaf Pipeline.The proponent has identified water savings from the Victorian Government's share of the Shepparton Modernisation project, savings from the CG1234 project achieved prior to the transfer to Water for Rivers in 2010/11 and a water quality reserve not allocated to environmental programs.The Victorian Government claims water savings achieved under Stage One of the Northern Victoria Infrastructure Renewal Project will form the primary source of water to be diverted through the Sugarloaf Pipeline.</DOC>

Since the Member lodged his question I have made an announcement on this issue.Since ABC Learning's insolvency late last year the Australian Government has had the interests of parents, their children and ABC Learning employees front and centre.The Government's approach throughout has been to seek an orderly, logical process for working through the problem with the primary focus on continuity of care for the children involved.In December 2009 we supported the appointment of Court Appointed Receivers - PPB Corporate Recovery, whose task has been to run a process aimed at selling the 241 non-Defence centres that were judged to be unviable under the ABC business model.We have funded the losses incurred by those centres and the Receivership costs, so that families can maintain existing child care arrangements while the process runs its course.The Court Appointed Receivers have a big job on their hands. No one has ever previously tried to sell 241 'unviable' childcare centres.PPB has made good progress and contracts are already being exchanged for 65 centres. However, the complexity of the Court Appointed Receivership is reflected in the fact that they are dealing with over 180 bidders whose bids relate to leases held by over 100 landlords.Against this background, PPB has asked the Government to continue to support the receivership for a short, one-off additional period. PPB's request has been agreed and the Government will make the relevant application to the NSW Supreme Court.The Government has also agreed to continue to fund the Court Appointed Receivership for a period of a further 6 weeks, on a once only basis, until 15 May 2009.Costs incurred by the Commonwealth during the receivership of ABC have been lower than was originally projected based on ABC's records. We have therefore agreed that underspends accrued on the process to date may be drawn upon to fund the continuation of the Court Appointed Receivership for the 6 week period. No additional tax payer funds will be needed to support centres as part of the ABC insolvency.PPB has advised that they will announce the outcome for each centre by 15 April 2009. This is expected to leave sufficient time for the sale process to be completed on or before 15 May 2009.</DOC>

I am advised the Salary Determination was signed on 5 March 2008 with a date of effect of 9 August 2007. It was implemented on 21 August 2008 and backdated to 9 August 2007.In May 2008, a written brief was provided to my office advising that a determination had been made by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. Issues relating to the implementation of the determination were brought to my attention as a result of the Senate Estimates hearing on 22 October 2008.and (4) I am advised the Australian Defence Force brought the matters before the Tribunal. The Special Forces Pay Group and Pay Structure sought to roll qualifications and skills allowances for qualified special forces personnel into a 16-group placement methodology.I am advised the case put before the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal did not seek to reduce salaries or allowances.and (7) The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal is an independent tribunal. The Australian Defence Force has no say over dates and implementation effect. I am advised the case put by the Special Forces Pay Group sought for the decision to be backdated to align it with the date of effect for other determinations. This outcome was sought on the grounds that to seek otherwise would be inequitable for Special Force members as they would otherwise not be eligible for the extra superannuation payable as a result of the anticipated effect of the Determination.I am advised that the Special Forces Pay Group did not anticipate that any soldiers were facing adverse financial hardship as a result of the matter. As a precaution however, the Chief of Army directed Special Operations Command to ensure that appropriate support mechanisms were provided to any soldier identified as requiring assistance.I am advised that there was no interest charged by Defence to any member in regard to any Special Forces Determination debts.I am advised that all Pay Category adjustments and remediation has now been completed, following the Chief of Army's directive. Any impact on individual soldiers will not be discussed due to privacy reasons. However, any affected estates would have now been remediated, in line with the Chief of Army's directive.I am advised that there was no Departmental decision to this effect.I am advised that the Determination made by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal was made in accordance with the pay case put before them. I am advised that Defence did not anticipate the management problems that have now been identified as a result of this Determination. The Australian Defence Force did not appreciate the complexity of the issues involved. In addition, the capabilities in the electronic systems on which this information was stored did not allow Defence to make an accurate assessment of the possible effects of the Determination.I am advised that following the signing of the determination in March 2008 and the decision for an implementation date of 21 August 2008, a series of rolling information briefs occurred. Following a review of members' individual proficiencies, the majority of members were informed in July 2008 that the changes could render their qualifications ineligible. Many of the discrepancies were identified during this review and action commenced to have qualifications accepted through recognition of prior learning and recognition of current competencies.Yes. I am advised that information to deployed personnel was communicated via email through the chain of command. Deployed personnel were briefed by their supervisors.I am advised that no interest was charged on debts as a result of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal Determination and that by 16 April 2009, all personnel affected by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal decisions had their original pay grade placements restored in the pay system thereby providing reimbursement for any debts that have occurred.I am advised that there will be no impact on the employer superannuation obligations for members of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme because the retirement benefit that is paid is a percentage of salary at retirement based on the member's rate of pay, which is the maximum rate of pay which applies to the member's rank and pay level and the member's number of years of effective service.I am advised that there should be no impact on the employer superannuation obligations for the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme members because the employer benefit is based on final average salary and years of effective service. Final average salary is one third of salary payable during the last 1095 days of service (i.e. three years).</DOC>

The National Education Agreement was signed on 29 November 2008. Consistent with the new Federal Financial Framework, input controls have been replaced by a strong focus on accountability and transparency measures which correlate more directly to educational outcomes. Responsibility for physical education lies with individual jurisdictions and non-government education authorities.On 5 December 2008, all Australian Education Ministers agreed to embed health and physical education as a learning area in state and territory school curricula. This was undertaken under the auspices of the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians.Information on individual schools is not available. The reporting requirements for this measure were part of an annual certification process by school authorities from the 2006 school year. School authorities were required to notify that they were compliant/not compliant for 2006 and 2007, but information on practice at individual schools (apart from non-government non-systemic schools) was not collected.This level of information is not available.</DOC>

There is currently no reliable, accurate data on national child care vacancy rates. The vacancy numbers provided by services to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations provide very limited assistance in assessing unmet demand for child care. Vacancies refer to the number of places, based on a service's own business practices, which the service considers to be available for use in the forthcoming week. Looking forward a single week is inadequate for long term planning and the model of reporting provides no information on unmet demand where services identify they have no vacancies.There are a number of data sources currently available to assist in planning the future location of child care centres. In respect of the location of the 260 centres the Department has used data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on population numbers, information from local governments on potential demographic changes. These data are publicly available. In addition, the Department has used utilisation data of current services from its administrative systems and information about the number of licensed places available in a given location. At the jurisdictional level this data is provided publicly via the Productivity Commission's Report on Government Services. This data cannot be made publicly available at a regional level as it would potentially release commercially sensitive material.The Department recognises that there are, however, limitations to using these data alone. Issues of quality and cost of care options, travel to work routes, availability of other care types and other localised issues all impact on the usage rates for a specific service/area, which will not be reflected in the aggregated data. On that basis, in addition to the data sources mentioned above, the Department has used local information, including local feasibility studies, reports by local/state or territory governments, planning information about future developments or expansion in the area, stakeholder feedback (including the Registration of Interest process undertaken by the Department) and any information available to the department about services in the area facing financial difficulties.As noted in my response to Question 2, there are a number of data sources available to assist in identifying the need for additional child care in a given location.Child care centres are required each week to report their anticipated vacancies for the following week. The information on whether a vacancy exists or not for a given service is publicly available in the manner intended when the system was developed. That is, if a parent rings the Child Care Access Hotline they will be informed of vacancies within the area of their interest. At this local level the vacancy information assists to provide parents with a guide to potential services that may meet their need. However, as vacancies reported is provided by individual services, without a clear definition or any process of verification, the accumulation of those numbers to regional, state or national reporting is neither valid nor reliable and hence has not been released publicly.Vacancy information will be made available to parents and the industry on mychild.gov.au in addition to the Child Care Access Hotline, but only after undertaking the ground work to ensure the data has improved accuracy and usefulness.The Department has found the vacancy data currently collected to be unhelpful in assessing the unmet demand for child care in the priority locations identified for Early Learning and Care Services.</DOC>

I am aware of a limited number of newspaper reports concerning parents being able to claim the quarterly 50 per cent Child Care Tax Rebate (CCTR) payment without paying their fees.Under family assistance legislation, parents cannot fraudulently claim CCTR. A family must incur a liability for the cost of using child care. Payment of CCTR is based on child care attendance information, as reported by the child care service providers. CCTR is not paid where there is no child care usage.Under family assistance legislation a family must have incurred a liability for payment of child care fees. These arrangements are in place so that the vast majority of families, who pay their fees on time, are not disadvantaged and receive their correct entitlements in a timely manner. Many families use this assistance to pay any outstanding fees to their child care service provider.Where an issue of non payment arises, the Professional Support Coordinator network can provide help to the management of a child care service provider to address the organisational and financial issues that might be affecting service viability.In addition to proof of enrolment and child care usage at a child care centre, families must meet the following eligibility requirements:they have a child in their care who meets the immunisation requirementsthey or their partner (if they have one) meet the residency requirementstheir child attends approved or registered care and they have the liability to pay for the cost of the child carethey must have their income assessed for Child Care Benefit (CCB) purposes (at zero rate CCB or more, as CCTR is not income tested)meet work, study and training requirements.and (6) There is no fraud against the Commonwealth  -  and by extension against the tax-payer. Parents have incurred a liability for which they are legally entitled to receive a tax rebate.</DOC>

Yes. Prior to the 2007 Federal Election, the AEC increased its focus on ensuring that as many eligible electors as possible were enrolled prior to the issue of the writs, including advice on the change to the close of rolls period. A national, targeted enrolment stimulation drive commenced in March 2007 with mail-outs, phone follow-up and door-knocking.For the 2007 election, the AEC's communication strategy included targeted advertising, products and initiatives for special groups including youth, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australians, Indigenous Australians, people experiencing homelessness, electors with disability, and overseas electors. Advertisements were placed on television and radio, in press, magazines, cinemas, outdoor billboards, and on the internet.In addition, as part of the national public awareness strategy for Indigenous electors, the following national activities were undertaken:- From April to August 2007, mainstream press and radio enrolment and election advertising was adapted (and translated into six languages for radio) for placement in Indigenous media and press. This included three enrolment editorials in the Koori Mail, a series of interviews and announcements on the National Indigenous Radio Service and a 'last chance' close of rolls media release;- A direct mail campaign including a 'how to vote' package was distributed to Indigenous community organisations, councils and media outlets; and- A section of the AEC website was developed for Indigenous electors with information on how to enrol and vote, including DVD segments, recorded radio interviews and other materials.The AEC in NSW undertook a range of activities to enrol Indigenous Australians for the 2007 Federal Election. In late 2006, staff from the Division of Chifley conducted a community visit and enrolment drive at the Western Sydney Community Aboriginal Corporation at Minchinbury.The 2007 Community Electoral Information Officer (CEIO) program was delivered across NSW. CEIOs visited a number of communities (including in the Division of Chifley) in the lead up to the 2007 election. The CEIOs made contact with community councils, Indigenous organisations, schools, resource centres, Indigenous sporting and other organisations. They also provided targeted AEC publications and pamphlets, enrolment forms, and postal vote applications. The field visits raised awareness of the electoral process, generated and confirmed the enrolment status of Indigenous electors and encouraged greater participation in the 2007 election.A CEIO officer attended community meetings to promote enrolment and voting, including:- A meeting of the South Western Sydney Indigenous Network where a presentation was conducted and enrolment packs distributed; and- The Indigenous Employment Expo at the University of Western Sydney, Blacktown campus. Footage from this event was used on the segment recorded for Living Black on SBS television.Local Indigenous communities in Doonside, Hebersham, Dharruk and Tregear in the Division of Chifley were included in the targeted enrolment stimulation program prior to the 2007 election.The electoral roll does not identify Aboriginality or any other ethnicity. From enrolment records the AEC cannot estimate the number of Indigenous people enrolled or not. The impact of enrolment initiatives targeted at Indigenous Australians cannot be measured in terms of enrolment numbers.At the close of rolls for the 2007 Federal Election, the Division of Chifley had 92,506 enrolled electors. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2006 Census (figures applied to the new Chifley divisional boundaries of 2007) estimate that approximately 2,500 Indigenous people of voting age reside in the Division of Chifley.Participation in the electoral process by Indigenous Australians is one of the AEC's business priorities. The AEC is committed to further develop and implement strategies aimed at increasing the level of enrolment and participation for Indigenous Australians throughout Australia.The AEC cannot estimate the number or percentage of Indigenous Australians not enrolled to vote in the Division of Chifley, for the reasons stated above.To increase the number of Indigenous Australians enrolled, the AEC will continue to establish relationships with Indigenous organisations and maintain contact with these organisations between electoral events through visits and attendance at Indigenous events.In the AEC's 2008-2009 National Business Plan, Indigenous Australians are identified as a business priority. The NSW State Office 2008-2009 Business Plan includes the following activities:- Participation in National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee (NAIDOC) Week activities (to be held from 5 to 12 July 2009); and- Working with divisions to implement relevant local strategies for their communities.The 2008-2009 Business Plan for the Division of Chifley includes local public awareness strategies, aimed at Indigenous electors. As part of the plan contact has been established with Blacktown Aboriginal Corporation in Doonside, Butucarbin Aboriginal Corporation and Aboriginal Youth Services in Hebersham and Stepup Employment in Minchinbury.AEC staff in the Chifley divisional office will attend the Indigenous Jobs Market 2009. This event is an opportunity for the AEC to further expand networks into the local Indigenous community.</DOC>

From 1 July 2008 until 11 March 2009 Wheat Exports Australia accredited twenty three companies to export bulk wheat.Accredited companies are: ABB Grain Ltd; AWB (Australia) Limited; AWB Harvest Finance Limited; Bunge Agribusiness Australia Pty Ltd; Cargill Australia Limited; Concordia Agritrading (Australia) Pty Ltd; Elders Toepfer Grain Pty Ltd; Emerald Group Australia Pty Ltd; Glencore Grain Pty Ltd; Goodman Fielder Consumer Foods Pty Ltd; GrainCorp Limited; GrainCorp Operations Limited, Grain Pool Pty Ltd; J.K. International Pty Ltd; Lempriere Grain Pty Ltd; Louis Dreyfus Australia Pty Ltd; Marubeni Australia Limited; Noble Resources Australia Pty Ltd; OzEpulse Pty Ltd; Pentag Commodities Pty Limited; Queensland Cotton Corporation Pty Ltd; Riverina (Australia) Pty Limited and Sumitomo Australia Pty Ltd. (b) All exporters who want to export bulk wheat from Australia must be accredited by Wheat Exports Australia under the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme.WEA cannot impose tonnage limitations unless a company seeks to limit its bulk exports as part of its application for accreditation. Tonnage limits apply to: Goodman Fielder Consumer Foods Pty Ltd, J.K. International Pty Ltd, Lempriere Grain Pty Ltd; OzEpulse Pty Ltd and Pentag Commodities Pty Limited. Details are available on the WEA website www.wea.gov.au. All other accredited exporters have no tonnage limitations.Since October 2008 bulk wheat has been exported to the following 29 countries: Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, New Zealand, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Yemen.Accreditations by WEA to export bulk wheat do not specify the port terminal to be used for export. Accreditations allow bulk wheat exporters to export from any port of their choosing. However, the legislation imposes specific requirements on accredited exporters or associated entities who also operate port terminal facilities to make sure they allow access to other exporters on fair and reasonable commercial terms.The Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme applies to bulk wheat exports only. Accreditation is not required for non-bulk wheat exports.</DOC>

The relationship between staffing in aged care facilities and the quality of the care delivered is complex.Â  Currently there is considerable diversity in staffing arrangements across accredited facilities.Â  This suggests that it is not clear that there is a single optimum staffing level and mix, and that rather, there may be many sets of arrangements that, in response to their particular circumstances, provide quality aged care.Under the Aged Care Act 1997 aged care providers are responsible for maintaining an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff and having in place a skills mix appropriate to the care needs of the residents.Â  Staff mixes will vary in individual facilities according to the nature of the care and service needs of residents, the mix of high and low care, the proportion of residents with dementia, etc.Â  These factors vary widely across aged care facilities.Â  Thus the number of staff that is appropriate for a given number of residents will vary from facility to facility and from time to time as changes in the mix of residents' needs within a facility occur.The Government has indicated that the issue of minimum staffing levels will be considered after the impact of the new Aged Care Funding Instrument on aged care financing is understood.Â  Since this will affect residents and their families, people who work in aged care, and care providers, the views of all of these groups will be sought.</DOC>

Fluorocarbon refrigerants, such as the type mentioned in the honourable member's question, are regulated in Australia under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Regulations 1995 (the Regulations). Only those businesses which hold a Refrigerant Trading Authorisation are allowed to acquire, possess or dispose of these refrigerants and only those technicians holding the appropriate qualifications and the associated Refrigerant Handling Licence are permitted to handle these refrigerants.Under the Regulations, technicians must ensure that all refrigerant is recovered from refrigeration or air conditioning equipment when it is decommissioning and must give the used refrigerant to a Refrigerant Trading Authorisation holder or a refrigerant destruction facility. Refrigerant Trading Authorisation holders must accept all surrendered refrigerant and must ensure that such refrigerant is destroyed by the operator of an approved refrigerant destruction facility.The regulatory controls are supported by an industry product stewardship scheme. The product stewardship scheme pays technicians for each kilogram of waste refrigerant that is returned for destruction, collects waste refrigerant from Refrigerant Trading Authorisation holders and organises disposal.There are offence provisions in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 and the Regulations relating to any act that causes refrigerant to be emitted to the atmosphere, other than in a manner prescribed by the Regulations.</DOC>

A pensioner's principal home and up to two hectares of private land on the same title is exempt from the social security assets test.Subject to certain qualification criteria, Age Pensioners and Carer Payment recipients of age pension age may have the maximum amount of land on the same title as their long-term principal home that can be exempt from the assets test, increased from two hectares to encompass all land on the same title. To qualify for the concessional treatment, the pensioner must have a long-term (20 year) continuous attachment to their principal home and land on the same title, and they must be making effective use of productive land to generate an income, given their capacity.The value of land in excess of that allowable in their circumstances (up to two hectares or all land on one title) is included in the pensioner's assessable assets when determining their rate of payment. The assets test has set thresholds below which a person's rate of payment is not affected. Currently the threshold is $171,750 for a single home owner and $243,500 for home owner couples. Where a person's rate of pension is worked out under the assets test, the value of their assets above the assets test threshold reduces their pension by $39 a year for each extra $1,000 in assets. Pensions currently cease to be payable when assets exceed $555,750 for a single home owner and $882,500 for home owner couples.</DOC>

The Government recognises the valuable role played by the not-for-profit sector and the importance of tax concessions to this sector.Fringe benefits tax (FBT) plays an important role in maintaining the fairness and integrity of Australia's taxation system. It places employees with access to fringe benefits on a more even footing with employees whose remuneration consists entirely of salary or wages. The introduction of FBT was designed to remove a serious gap in the income tax law and ensure that all forms of remuneration paid to employees bear a fair measure of tax. The FBT system also facilitates including fringe benefits in an employee's income for means testing benefits such as family tax benefit, ensuring that families are treated equally.The Government provides FBT concessions to assist not-for-profit organisations to undertake their work. Public benevolent institutions, public hospitals, ambulance services and health promotion charities are provided with a capped exemption from FBT in recognition of the special nature of those organisations.A number of other non-government, not-for-profit organisations that are eligible for a capped rebate of 48Â percent of the amount of FBT that would otherwise be payable. The rebate is available to not - for-profit employers who are unable to claim FBT as a tax deduction. Organisations that qualify for this rebate include certain religious, educational, scientific or public educational institutions.The concessional fringe benefits tax valuation of some motor vehicles benefits is not directed at assisting not - for - profit organisations undertake their activities. The valuation methodology was introduced as part of the original FBT legislation with the aim of minimising compliance costs for all businesses.I note that the tax treatment of the not-for-profit sector falls within the scope of Australia's Future Tax System Review. The review's consultation paper, issued in December 2008, discusses, amongst other matters, the FBT concessions available to the not-for-profit sector and the valuation of motor vehicle benefits.</DOC>

In respect of the Old Bar Beach Sand Replenishment Group Inc:Yes. (b) Yes, I am aware of the group's concerns regarding the erosion of the Old Bar foreshore and the resulting loss of houses in this location. I have received correspondence from the group in November 2008 and February 2009.Planning and management of coastal areas primarily rests with State Governments, which in turn, have devolved many aspects of day to day planning decisions to Local Government bodies.This particular matter is the responsibility of the local Council for Old Bar Beach, the Greater Taree City Council.Under the NSW Government's NSW Coastline Management Manual, 1990,Â the Greater Taree City Council has established a Coastline Management Committee to develop a Coastal Zone Management Plan for the Greater Taree City Council area, including Old Bar Beach.Development of the Coastal Zone Management Plan has commenced.Until the Coastal Zone Management Plan has been completed, caution should be taken to ensure that any interim works follow the NSW Coastline Management Manual and advice is sought from the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change's Coastal Engineers.My Department has advised the Old Bar Beach Sand Replenishment Group to liaise with the Greater Taree City Council and to engage a coastal engineer to identify the most appropriate method of approaching the sand erosion problem in this specific area.While the Australian Government has a limited involvement in coastal planning processes, we acknowledge the challenges facing coastal communities through unprecedented levels of population growth and the potential risks from a changing climate. To better prepare for these challenges the Rudd Government's recent Caring for our Country initiative directs resources to provide necessary information and stimulate action in coastal communities.Further information on this initiative can be found on the Caring for our Country website at www.nrm.gov.au.The Department of Climate Change through the Local Adaptation Pathways Program is providing funding to help local councils undertake climate change risk assessments and develop action plans to prepare for the likely local impacts of climate change.Further information on this program can be found on the Department of Climate Change website at www.climatechange.gov.au/impacts/settlements.htmlThe Department of Climate Change, in consultation with State and Territory Governments, is also conducting a 'first pass' National Coastal Vulnerability Assessment. This assessment will identify:the risks to Australia's coastal zone from climate change (including the implications of sea-level rise);national priorities for Australia's adaptation response, including priority areas for research; andthe final report on the 'first pass' National Coastal Vulnerability Assessment is due for completion in 2009. This will be followed by extensive consultation on the results of the work and on directions for the future.Additionally, on 20 March 2008, Senator the Hon Penny Wong, Minister for Climate Change and Water and I requested the House of Representative Standing Committee on the Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts undertake an Inquiry into climate change and environmental impacts on coastal communities (the Inquiry).The Inquiry is to report on issues related to climate change and environmental pressures experienced by the Australian coastal areas and give regard to policies and programs, population growth, sustainable use of resources, climate change impacts including projected seas level rise, promotion of sustainable communities and governance and institutional arrangements.To date there have been 103 submissions and 22 public hearings to the Inquiry. Public hearings have been scheduled through to the end of MayÂ 2009.See answer to (1) (b).It would be more appropriate for the OBBSRI and the individual mentioned to meet with the State and local government representatives who have the primary responsibility for planning and management of coastal areas.</DOC>

Eligibility for the Gold Card is assessed on an individual basis and is determined by specific criteria set out in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA).Under the VEA, a veteran who served in the Australian Defence Force is entitled to the Gold Card if the veteran:has qualifying service and has reached the age of 70 years; oris severely disabled due to war or defence service; oris receiving a service pension and satisfies the income and assets tests for treatment; oris receiving a disability pension at 50 per cent of the general rate and also a service pension; oris an Australian former prisoner of war.Qualifying service attributable to service during World War II is different from 'operational service' in that there are two elements to the concept of qualifying service. Firstly, a person must have been engaged in operations against the enemy and secondly, the person must have incurred danger from the enemy at that time. A veteran incurs danger from hostile forces when he or she is at risk or in peril of actual bodily harm from hostile forces.Those who served in certain locations of Northern Australia above latitude 14.5 degrees south for at least three months between 19Â February 1942 and 12 November 1943 (inclusive) have both operational and qualifying service. Operational service provides access to the disability pension and treatment for accepted disabilities.The origin of the 14.5 degree south latitude and period 19 February 1942 til 12 November 1943 goes back to 1943 when the Repatriation Act 1920 was amended to include service 'within Australia' as service in a 'theatre of war'. The Repatriation Commission, which determined what areas were to be 'theatres of war' for the purpose of the Repatriation Act 1920, defined 'theatre of war' as including the Northern Territory north of the parallel 14.5 degree south latitude between 19 February 1942 and 12Â November 1943. The latitude 14.5 degree south was selected as the furthermost limit of the range of Japanese bombers operating against Australia, while the dates 19 February 1942 and 12 November 1943 were the dates of the first and last Japanese bombing raids on the Northern Territory. In 1986 the Repatriation Act 1920 was replaced by the VEA.Veterans who served north of 14.5 degrees south and the islands contiguous to that part of the Northern Territory for less than three months during the specified period may also qualify if they 'incurred danger'. As the test for 'incurred danger' is objective, not subjective, qualifying service in such circumstances is determined on a case - by - case basis. This interpretation of 'incurred danger' accords with that made by the Full Federal Court in the case of the Repatriation Commission v Thompson and is consistent with the intent of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and its predecessor legislation.Personnel in convoys travelling from Alice Springs to Darwin may have been apprehensive and aware of the possibility of being bombed (or strafed), but a person does not incur actual danger by merely perceiving or fearing that they are in danger. To be at risk or in peril from hostile forces of the enemy and therefore have qualifying service, a member of the convoys would have to have been in the general area of a bombing.</DOC>

The Commonwealth has agreed to provide $970 million over 5 years for the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education (NP ECE), which has been signed by members of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and is available on the COAG website. This includes $955 million to be distributed to states and territories to support the implementation of Universal Access, $14 million for data development and evaluation and $1Â million for completing previous projects funded under initial Universal Access payments in 2007 - 08.Yes.The 2009 Report on Government Services (RoGS) states that the preschool participation rate in New South Wales was 60.4 per cent in 2007 - 08, compared to 64.6 per cent in 2006 - 07. NSW Officials have estimated the actual participation rate at 87 per cent if preschool provided through Department of Education and Training and private Long Day Care Centres is included.The distribution of Universal Access funding to states and territories through the NP ECE is based on the population of 4 year olds in each jurisdiction. For the first 4 years of the NP ECE loadings apply based on the 'gap' in early childhood education participation and hours, and the 'cost' in terms of remoteness and the Socio-Economic Index for Areas. In the final year, funds will be distributed based solely on the projected population of 4 year olds in each jurisdiction. The proportion of the $955 million to be allocated to NSW has been calculated on a weighted distribution that included an estimated participation rate of 87 per cent for NSW. This is reflected in the NP ECE as endorsed by all first ministers. The proportion of funding to each state and territory is noted in the NP ECE. NSW will receive a total of $278.6 million over 5 years.The Commonwealth is negotiating a Bilateral Agreement with the NSW Government that will detail how Commonwealth funding toward the achievement of Universal Access, by 2013, will be utilised in that State.The delivery and regulation of preschool is a state government responsibility. The NPÂ ECE requires all states and territories to maintain their current roles and level of effort in the delivery of preschool programs.The Bilateral Agreement, currently being finalised, will contain a series of agreed deliverables and timeframes for actions in the first two calendar years. The National Partnership and the Bilateral Agreement will be reviewed after 18 months to assess progress towards the Universal Access to early childhood education commitment.Payment to the NSW Government will be made once the Bilateral Agreement is approved by the relevant Ministers. Payments will be made in accordance with the payment cycle notified in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. Funding will be provided on a 6 monthly cycle, based on progress reporting, including annual progress against agreed performance indicators.</DOC>

On 9 February 2009, Japanese authorities referred a number of incidents between the Marine Vessel (MV) Steve Irwin and Japanese whaling vessels to the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. As a result of the referral and in accordance with Australia's domestic obligations under the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation 1988, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) commenced preliminary enquiries regarding alleged violations of Australian domestic law.As a result of these enquiries, the AFP boarded and executed a search warrant on the MV Steve Irwin, following its arrival in Hobart on 20 February 2009. The decision to execute a search warrant was an operational decision of the AFP.Further information on this matter is available in the Hansard record of the AFP's appearance before Additional Estimates on 23 February 2009.</DOC>

Eligibility for the Government's Economic Security Strategy payments made in December 2008 was dependent on a person receiving a qualifying payment, like the Age Pension, on 14 October 2008. That was the day the Strategy was announced.People whose pension was suspended due to employment or were on a zero rate of pension due to the application of the income test on 14 October 2008, could not be regarded as 'receiving' their pension. It is possible for Age Pensioners to be suspended or have a zero rate for up to 13 weeks during temporary employment.The income test threshold applying as at 14 October 2008 for pensioner couples to receive a part pension cut out at $2,602 per fortnight. Therefore a pensioner couple with no other income who earned $564 in the week ending 17 October 2008 would not have missed out on the Economic Security Strategy payment. It is possible that the additional earned income of $564 from casual work together with income from other sources increased the couples overall income for that fortnight above this threshold resulting in the suspension of their pension for the period that included the 14 October 2008.</DOC>

FaHCSIA is unable to identify the number of investors with non-bank funds currently unable to access their investments. However, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has information on the number of people in those frozen mortgage funds that have received the benefit of ASIC's hardship relief.Generally investments are exempted from the deeming rules when the investment has fundamentally failed. Where a company is placed in liquidation and the administrator or liquidator confirms the estimated returns for investors, the reduced value of a customer's investment with the failed company may be re-assessed and back-dated to the date a company administrator was first appointed.Â Arrears of income support payments may be payable in these circumstances.Funds that are frozen continue to be treated as financial investments for deeming purposes because, although the fund may be temporarily frozen, it has not failed.In some circumstances, an income support recipient may be eligible for payments under hardship provisions if their investment is considered unrealisable in circumstances where their pension is reduced or cancelled under the assets test, and they are in severe financial hardship.</DOC>

The Government has made it clear that it expects all lending institutions to pass on reductions in interest rates to Australian households and businesses as quickly as possible.The Government's investment in up to $8 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) is helping smaller lenders to raise new funds and add competitive pressure to the mortgage market.The Government's wholesale funding and deposit guarantees have ensured that second tier ADIs have access to funding, which has allowed them to continue to lend to households and businesses, and at lower interest rates than otherwise would have been possible. This has helped maintain competition in the Australian lending markets.</DOC>

Yes, Australian wool insulation will be eligible. All ceiling insulation products and technologies are eligible provided that they meet the minimum material and installation requirements in terms of safety, quality and performance set out in the relevant Australian Standards and the Building Code of Australia. These are outlined in the Early Installation Guidelines for the insulation components of the Energy Efficient Homes Package.One industry association, the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand (ICANZ) estimates that when ceiling insulation is correctly installed into a typical home, 'the energy and greenhouse gas emissions produced during its manufacture would be recovered in around four to five weeks'. ICANZ further estimates 'that when R3.5 glasswool insulation batts are installed into a typical home with a remaining lifespan of say, 40 years, it will save over 340 times the energy made to use them.' Refer to Attachment A for full media release.It's important that the broadest range of insulation products and technologies that meet the minimum standards outlined in the guidelines are eligible for installation under the program. This will promote economic activity and job creation across the broader insulation industry supply and distribution chain. It will also allow the full capacity of the Australian insulation industry to be deployed in meeting the demand necessary to insulate 2.7 million homes in 2.5 years.
ATTACHMENT A
Research by the international consulting firm McKinsey and Company  - A cost curve for greenhouse gas reduction found that 'Almost a quarter of possible emissions reductions would result from measures (such as better insulation in buildings that carry no net lifecycle cost, in fact they come free of charge)'.Stern Review  - Economics of Climate Change found that 'energy efficiency has the potential to be the biggest single source of emissions savings in the energy sector. This would have both environmental and economic benefits: energy-efficiency measures cut waste and often save money'.United Nations Environmental Project  - Buildings and climate change, Status Challenges and Opportunities highlights that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the building sector accounts for 30-40 per cent of global energy use. Substantial benefits can be gained at low cost by improving the energy efficiency of buildings.International Energy Agency  - World Energy Outlook 2006 found that `Meeting the world's growing hunger for energy requires massive investment in energy supply infrastructure_ Policies that encourage the more efficient production and use of energy contribute 80 per cent of the avoided CO2 emissions_'.'As a one-off investment, insulation provides substantial and ongoing benefits in energy and greenhouse gas savings. It also improves the comfort, health and well-being benefits that flow on to extra money in the household budget, improved productivity, and less incidents of illness,' Mr D'Arcy said.Mr D'Arcy also reported that some Australians are seeking more comfort by buying air-conditioners instead of insulating or improving the energy efficiency of their homes first. The number of air conditioners installed in Australia rose from 33 per cent of homes in 1994 to over 60 per cent of homes in 2005 (ABS 4602.0 2005).'This trend has continued and is one of the main reasons for increasing home energy demand.'Importantly, the Federal Government's insulation measures are a key to addressing burgeoning household energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.They will also assist many less fortunate Australians to achieve the comfort levels they desire and reduce their energy bills, leaving more money for rent, mortgage or other household budget items,' Mr D'Arcy said.Media inquiries: Glenn Schaube GRS Communications: 03 9478 5224, 0439 320 151</DOC>

The Report of the Review of the delivery by the federal courts of family law services, Future Governance Options for Federal Family Law Courts in Australia: Striking the Right Balance, recommended that there be a single family court, with two separate judicial divisions  -  a Superior and Appellate Division, and, a General Division  -  with existing Family Court of Australia judges constituting the former, and Federal Magistrates with family law expertise being offered appointment to the latter division (paragraphs 111-112).A submission to the Review made by Chief Federal Magistrate Pascoe on 5 June 2008 outlined the overall view of the Federal Magistrates Court at that time, that any structural changes to the Court might affect its 'collegiality, culture and work practices'. The submission is available on my Department's website, www.ag.gov.au.On 20 November 2008, the report of the Review and a consultation paper were released for public comment. On 6 February 2009, Chief Federal Magistrate Pascoe, on behalf of the Federal Magistrates Court, made a submission noting that it was 'pleasing that the report recognises the culture of the Court and places significant emphasis on the preservation of this culture and work ethic within a new structure' (submission, pÂ 3) and that a 'large number of Federal Magistrates expressed support for the recommendations of the Semple Report' (submission, p 7). The submission is available on my Department's website, www.ag.gov.au. The Government is considering the recommendations made by the Report of the Review.Having regard to the Chief Federal Magistrate's submission of 6 February 2009 on behalf the Federal Magistrates Court, these questions do not arise.</DOC>

The United Nations Human Rights Council considered Bangladesh's human rights record under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process during its session from 2-13 February 2009. The Council will review the human rights records of all 192 United Nations Member States once every four years. During the session Australia recommended that the Government of Bangladesh take steps to implement the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord and encouraged the Government of Bangladesh to take steps to protect the social, economic, and cultural rights of minorities, refugees and displaced people.The Australian High Commission in Dhaka maintains an ongoing relationship with the Chittagong Hill Tracts International Commission. It attended the Commission's briefing sessions on 16 and 22 February 2009 to seek an update on the political and human rights situation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Australian High Commissioner to Bangladesh takes every appropriate opportunity to encourage the Government of Bangladesh to fully implement the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord.The Australian Government explores options to assist the people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), subject to funding availability.Over the period 2006-2010, 100 scholarships to study in Australia will be provided in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support the indigenous people of the CHT. The scholarship program aims to enhance the human resources of the CHT people.The people of the CHT are also assisted as part of Australia's broader Bangladesh country assistance program. In May 2008, AusAID signed a four year agreement with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to provide $20 million in assistance to an Integrated Maternal and Child Health Project, targeting mothers, new-borns and children under five. The project has been implemented in two sub-districts of Bandarban, a district of the CHT. It will be expanded to cover all seven sub-districts over the next three years.</DOC>

and (2) The department publishes details of the discretionary grants issued by programs which it administers or manages on the discretionary grants page of the department's website (http://www.dfat.gov.au/dept/grants/). Details published include recipient name, grant title, grant description, date of approval and amount. However, the department does not maintain nor publish information on the electorates in which funded organisations or activities are located.Identifying successful discretionary grants applications pertaining to the Electorate of Moncrieff fully would entail:checking the business address of each funded organisation at the time of grant approval against the electoral boundaries for Moncrieff; andchecking separately whether any funded activity occurred within the Electorate of Moncrieff.It is difficult to estimate costs and resources required to carry out such an exercise, but it would entail a significant diversion of resources. In these circumstances, and given the information publicly available on the discretionary grants page of the department's website, I do not consider the work can be justified.No.In response to queries from Parliamentarians, Portfolio Ministers and the department have in the past provided advice about successful discretionary grant applications. The Government's decision that from 6 December 2007 details of all discretionary grants must be published on agency websites now provides the means by which the department makes public details of successful discretionary grant applications.No.</DOC>

The Terms of Reference for the Review of the delivery by the federal courts of family law services required consideration of governance options for a more integrated family law system, structures and management processes necessary to achieve this, and impact of any such changes on administrative or judicial structures. The issue of legal costs for litigants was beyond the scope of the Terms of Reference for the Review. However, the Report of the Review, Future Governance Options for Federal Family Law Courts in Australia: Striking the Right Balance, does note the improvements for litigants, such as less forum confusion, which could result from the proposed merger (paragraphs 100 and 124).I have not requested my Department to model savings in legal costs for family law litigants before any implementation of the restructure of the federal courts recommended by the Report of the Review. At this stage my Department is focussed on improvements in the corporate governance, judicial case management and structure for the family court system. These improvements will enable a greater number of disputes to be resolved as efficiently as possible without the cost and trauma of protracted litigation, including through simpler procedures, front end support for users and better integration of courts with other dispute resolution services.</DOC>

It is not meant to have a specific monetary value.The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be closely monitoring the submission of applications under the BER and will be working with states/territories and Block Grant Authorities to ensure an equitable distribution of funds. In circumstances where a school's funding is lower than their notional allocation, the project will not be approved unless it can be demonstrated that consultation with the schools' principal and community has occurred.</DOC>

The Community Level Initiative (CLI) is one of the components of the National Binge Drinking Strategy, which provides an avenue to establish and develop local solutions to address youth binge drinking within communities.Over 300 applications for CLI funding were received. The large number of applications meant that the selection process was very competitive. Proposals were rigorously assessed against the agreed criteria by an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) which was established to oversee the selection process. Membership of the EAG comprised representatives from the Australian National Council on Drugs including indigenous representation, the Australian Local Government Association, representatives from the Australian Youth Forum, and the Department of Health and Ageing. After the assessment process was completed, the EAG recommended 19 projects for funding. Some $3.6 million was available for this round of funding. The 19 successful projects account for this full amount. The 'Rethinking Drinking in WA Sport Project' was found to be less suitable for funding than the successful projects.While no sporting organisations were successful in the first CLI round, many of the successful projects incorporate activities in the sporting field. For example, some of the successful projects are targeting youth through sporting clubs and licensed premises by providing alcohol-free venues and events and engaging youth in sporting activities, so that sport becomes a healthy alternative to alcohol consumption.In addition, $5.2 million was provided under the National Binge Drinking Strategy for the significant expansion of the Good Sports initiative of the Australian Drug Foundation. The Good Sports initiative aims to develop safer and healthier communities by supporting local sporting clubs to build a culture of responsible drinking. The program helps sporting clubs manage alcohol responsibly and reduce alcohol related problems such as binge and underage drinking.The Australian Government is also working closely with sporting organisations to develop solutions to binge drinking, particularly by younger Australians, again as part of the National Binge Drinking Strategy. The Minister for Sport, the Hon Kate Ellis MP, announced on 18 January 2009 that six major sporting organisations, representing football, cricket, netball, rugby union, rugby league and AFL, have signed up to a National Alcohol Code of Conduct (the Code). The Code includes principles for the responsible service and consumption of alcohol and outlines responsibilities for organisations and for individuals when representing their sport. These six sporting organisations are also working with the Government to develop and implement the Club Champions Program. It will provide education and support within sporting clubs to encourage the safe and responsible consumption of alcohol.</DOC>

The Australian Government is not privy to any contract Visionstream may have to install communication infrastructure for pre-wired offices in the Port Hedland and Broome regions of Western Australia.There are a number of businesses supplying telecommunications services and Visionstream may have a contract with one of these businesses.The Government would encourage individuals and businesses considering purchasing telecommunications services to investigate the range of services and providers that may be available to them. If any particular small business or individual consumer experiences difficulty in obtaining a telecommunications service promptly they may wish to discuss the matter with their telephone company, including whether they are entitled to compensation under the Customer Service Guarantee, and/or the provision of an interim service. If individuals or small businesses are unable to resolve the matter they should seek the assistance of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.Part 2 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 requires the Primary Universal Service Provider, Telstra to take all reasonable steps to ensure that standard telephone services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra's Standard marketing Plan (SMP) sets out how Telstra will meet its obligations under the USO. The SMP provides that where a site is not readily accessible to telephone network infrastructure that Telstra can use, or where Telstra does not have access to sufficient capacity on existing infrastructure, Telstra will aim to supply the standard telephone service within 20 working days from the date of the customer's request, or on a later date if requested or agreed to by the customer. The SMP also provides that where Telstra expects extensive delays it will offer the customer an interim service.The Australian Communications and Media Authority has broad powers to penalise Telstra if it breaches the USO. If Telstra has not satisfactorily met its SMP, ACMA can be contacted by phone on 03Â 9963Â 6800, via email to payphones@acma.gov.au or by writing to:Industry Monitoring TeamPO Box 13112Law CourtsMELBOURNE VIC 8010Individual consumers and small business in the Port Hedland and Broome areas may be entitled to financial compensation under the Telecommunications (Customer Service Guarantee) Standard 2000 (CSG). The CSG provides that telephone companies must pay financial compensation to customers where certain minimum performance requirements are not met. Minimum standards under the CSG include the time within which new services must be connected; faults must be rectified; and appointments must be kept.The CSG only applies to consumers with five phone lines or less. If a carriage service provider supplies a customer with more than five eligible telephone services at one time, the carriage service provider is exempt from complying with a performance standard in relation to the supply of each of the services.</DOC>

The AFP undertook preliminary inquiries in relation to incidents which were alleged to have occurred at sea between the Japanese whaling fleet and the Steve Irwin in response to a formal request from Japanese authorities on 17 February 2009 for Australia to investigate the alleged incidents. As a result of the referral and in accordance with Australia's domestic obligations under the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (1993) (SUA Convention) the AFP commenced enquiries in relation to alleged violations of Australian domestic law.I was briefed on 20 February 2009, the day the AFP executed its search warrant on the vessel, by a ministerial submission from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That submission was for my information only and did not seek any decision by me. I noted the submission.</DOC>

Yes. Based on the latest Local Government Area (LGA) population figures available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website (Population by Age and Sex, Regions of Australia, 2007 - Catalogue Number 3235.0), the Blacktown LGA (285,564) contains more people than the Darwin LGA (72,859) and the Hobart LGA (49,593).However, Canberra is not part of an LGA, but is included in the 'Unincorporated ACT' LGA region reported by the ABS. Blacktown does not contain more people than the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region (339,761), and is the fourth largest LGA region behind Brisbane (1,006,976), Gold Coast (524,654) and the ACT (339,761)Queries regarding the administration of the Mt Druitt and Blacktown hospitals would be more appropriately directed to New South Wales (NSW) Health.Queries regarding the service volumes and reasons for presentation at emergency departments for Blacktown Mount-Druitt Hospital (BMDH) or any other NSW public hospital are more appropriately directed to NSW Health.Queries related to hospital forecast activity for BMDH are more appropriately directed to NSW Health.Queries regarding Blacktown LGA trends are best directed to the ABS.</DOC>

According to the 2006 Census Indigenous Profiles Blacktown Local Government Area (LGA) has the biggest urban population in NSW, and ranks 4th among all Australian LGAs.The Australian Government is working towards improved health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through whole-of-government arrangements for policy development and service delivery, and improved access to, and responsiveness of, the mainstream health system.On 29 November 2008, the Commonwealth announced $805.5 million over four years from 2009-10 as its contribution to COAGs' $1.6 billion National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes. This investment will make a significant contribution towards closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non Indigenous Australians within a generation.In addition to mainstream services, the Government funds a number of specific initiatives in Blacktown to provide improved health in key areas such as primary health, maternal health, mental health and drug and alcohol services.The Aboriginal Medical Service in Mt Druitt receives $2.1 million to provide primary health care and bringing them home services to Indigenous people in the Sydney West Region, including $281,000 under the New Directions: Mothers and Babies Services.The Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation in Blackett receives $434,000 in Commonwealth funds to provide drug and alcohol services including counselling, advocacy and referral services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients and their families.WentWest Limited receives $1.546 million in Commonwealth funds to provide general practice support and health services to the Blacktown LGA, including health checks for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.The Men's Health Information and Resource Centre known as 'The Shed' in Blacktown is an initiative under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy that provides emotional and practical support for men. This service has a special focus on Indigenous men (approximately 80% of clients) and men aged 25  -  45. In 2008/09 'the Shed' will receive $235,541 of Commonwealth funding.Under the National Illicit Drug Strategy Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grant Program (NIDS NGOTGP) Bridges Incorporated will receive $188,000 in 2008/09 to provide outreach counselling to the Aboriginal Medical Service Western Sydney and Mt Druitt Indigenous Church, this funding was recently extended.Due to the limitations in data quality and the variation year to year due to the small size of the Indigenous population in Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes Indigenous life expectancy estimates at the state and national levels only. Therefore, it is not possible to determine Indigenous life expectancy estimates for small geographic areas.</DOC>

No. Australian Wheat Board (AWB) was responsible for dealings with individual wheat growers and AWB then entered into insurance contracts with Export Finance Insurance Corporation for the sale of wheat to Iraq.No. The government paid up to 80 per cent (on average) under the insurance contracts, thus discharging its financial obligation. Receipt of the balance owed to growers will be dependent on Iraq meeting its commitments under the terms of the repayment agreement.The money owed will be paid directly to AWB as it was the counterparty on the insurance contracts.No.Yes.The government is committed to helping farmers and rural communities still experiencing one of the worst droughts in Australian history. Since 2001 the government has provided more than $3.4 billion in exceptional circumstances assistance to farmers and small business operators. Farmers have also been offered immediate financial assistance under the government's $42 billion Nation Building and Job plan. The $950 Farmer's Hardship Payment will be paid automatically by Centrelink from 24 March 2009 and will benefit around 21 000 farmers who receive exceptional circumstances drought relief or income support payments.Â Â </DOC>

I approved 34 entities to budget for an operating loss in 2007-08 compared to 15 entities in 2006-07. The reasons for the approvals in 2007-08 were (see explanations of reasons* below):Department/AgencyReason for LossCotton Research and Development CorporationOtherAustralian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines AuthorityOtherExport Wheat CommissionOtherLand and Water AustraliaTimingAustralian Commission for Law Enforcement IntegrityHigher net expenditure, AccountingFederal Court of AustraliaOne-off costs, AccountingAustralian Crime CommissionTimingAustralian Federal PoliceAccounting, TimingAttorney-General's DepartmentTimingAustralian Fisheries Management AuthorityOne-off costsAustralian War MemorialAccountingDepartment of Veterans' AffairsOne-off costsFilm AustraliaAccountingSydney Harbour Federation TrustHigher net expenditureDirector of National ParksTimingAustralian Film CommissionTiming, OtherAustralia CouncilTimingIndigenous Land CorporationTimingOffice of Commonwealth OmbudsmanTimingAged Care Standards and Accreditation AgencyTimingAustralian Sports Anti-Doping AuthorityTimingCancer AustraliaHigher net expenditureAustralian Sports CommissionOne-off costsPrivate Health Insurance Administration CouncilTimingDepartment of Health and AgeingHigher net expenditureCentrelinkOtherCommonwealth Rehabilitation Services AustraliaOtherDepartment of Human ServicesTimingMedicare AustraliaOtherAustralian National Audit OfficeTimingAustralian Public Service CommissionAccountingAustralian Taxation OfficeOne-off costsAustralian Competition and Consumer CommissionAccountingAustralian Bureau of StatisticsHigher net expenditure* Explanation of reasons:Timing - Losses usually resulting from differences in timing between revenue and expenses - for example, an agency may have been asked to perform additional duties to be funded in another financial year.Accounting - Adjustments to non-cash expenses due to accounting treatments such as revaluations, write-downs or recalculation of accrued employee entitlements or depreciation are classified under this category.One-Off Costs  -  These are losses resulting from one-off factors, such as the spending of cash reserves to fund new systems or office relocation costs.Higher net expenditure (financial health)  -  These losses may be due to a number of factors and are likely to be an indicator that the erosion of equity will continue in the future.Other  -  Losses that do not fit into the above four categories. This may include reasons such as lower than budgeted income (eg a reduction in the total amount of levies collected from industry as a result of the drought), or higher than expected costs.Yes. The following departments and agencies incurred operating losses in 2007-08 without my prior approval for the following reasons:Department/AgencyReason for LossAustralian Communications and Media AuthorityHigher net expenditureAustradeHigher net expenditureDepartment of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous AffairsOtherChild Support AgencyHigher net expenditureGeneral Practice Education and Training LimitedOtherYes. As at 18 March 2008, I had approved the following departments and agencies to budget for operating losses in the 2008-09 financial year for the following reasons:Department/AgencyReason for LossCotton Research and Development CorporationOtherAustralian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines AuthorityOtherAustralian Fisheries Management AuthorityOne-off costsAustralian Transactions Report and Analysis CentreOne-off costsFederal Court of AustraliaOne-off costs, AccountingHuman Rights and Equal Opportunity CommissionTimingAustralian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander StudiesTiming, accountingGeoscience AustraliaTimingDepartment of Transport and Regional ServicesOtherAustralian Maritime Safety AuthorityAccountingAustralia CouncilTimingNational Museum of AustraliaTimingAustralian Public Service CommissionAccountingAdministrative Appeals TribunalOtherYes. I did not approve requests from two agencies to budget for operating losses for the following reasons:AgencyReasonOffice of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC)As approval would have locked in higher than sustainable expenses, it was suggested that a more appropriate funding structure be sought.Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)As a large percentage of AIHW's revenue comes from the provision of services to predominantly government agencies, it was suggested that a reassessment of cost of services and levels of services provided be undertaken.For the 2007-08 financial year, I have adjusted the appropriations available to agencies pursuant to section 8 (1) of the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 2007-08 and have withheld the issuing of a total amount of $3.2 billion, spread among various agencies. This amount represents annual administered appropriations which remained unexpensed at the end of the 2007-08 financial year and has effectively been returned to the budget.It is generally not possible for a department or agency to use depreciation funding to increase other operating expenses above budgeted levels without incurring an operating loss. One of the key controls in the budget framework is the limits on the capacity of agencies to budget for, and incur, operating losses. The framework does not allow an agency to budget for a loss without seeking the approval of the Finance Minister. This process is one of the ways that the Department and the Finance Minister are able to examine an agency's financial situation, including any indication that agencies are not overspending on the amount of recurrent funding they have received.In terms of expenditure, agencies are currently funded for depreciation as well as other operating costs and such funding is appropriated as a single amount for each entity. Each dollar of funding is not, however, separately tracked to determine the specific accounting line to which it relates. Nevertheless, as part of the accountability and transparency of their operations, agencies are required to prepare financial statements on an annual basis and include detailed data such as cash flow by item as well as a breakdown of depreciation expenses.Neither the number of policy proposals costed by Budget Group nor the average length of time spent by relevant officers on costing each policy proposal for the 2008-09 Budget are statistics that are recorded by my Department.Budget Group staff accrued a total of 5,056 hours of formal Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) from 1 January to 30 June 2008. Formal TOIL reflects those additional hours of work which are formally approved by managers and entered into a central Finance records system. Managers may also provide informal TOIL but Finance holds no central records of informal TOIL hours.The amount of revenue spent by agencies pursuant to section 31 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 is not collected centrally. However, this information is available for each agency in their financial statements.The Contingency Reserve (CR) includes Government decisions if they occur late in the process, and are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Such estimates are included in the CR but are not published separately. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-in-confidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR.The CR includes economic parameter revisions if they occur late in the process, and are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Such estimates are included in the CR but are not published separately. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-in-confidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR.The provisions in the CR for Official Development Assistance (ODA) are consistent with the Government target of achieving its target of ODA being 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income by 2015-16. The proportions relating to each of the forward estimates were published on pages 6-7 and 6-8 of Budget Paper No. 1 2008-09. Relevant amounts will be transferred from the CR into agency estimates following Government decisions to provide new funding to implement ODA eligible measures.The CR makes provision for events that are reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates but cannot be reliably allocated to individual programs. Amounts allocated to those items in the CR are not typically published individually. This reflects the fact that disclosure of specific amounts could jeopardise the integrity of commercial-in-confidence or national security-in-confidence items included in the CR.As indicated on page 68 of MYEFO 2008-09, an example of an event reasonably expected to affect the budget estimates is the continuation of the Government's support for the Northern Territory Emergency Response beyond 2008-09.No. As at 1 December 2008, there was no provision in the CR for any expenditure relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.</DOC>

I am aware of increased salinity levels in Lake Bonney.No.The South Australian Government is responsible for management of LakeÂ Bonney, including the volumes and timing of water to prevent critical environmental deterioration of this site. Across the Basin, states are working cooperatively in determining which icon sites will receive water recovered from the Living Murray process. The Basin states, including South Australia, are responsible for identifying priorities in their jurisdiction. Water held by the Australian Government for environmental use is managed by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder selects sites for watering after receiving advice from the Environmental Water Scientific Advisory Committee and from Basin states.</DOC>

The Government's estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a stimulus of 1 per cent of GDP can be expected to increase GDP growth by between Â½ and 1 percentage point. This is based on the assumption of a fiscal multiplier of between 0.5 and 1 (that is, each additional dollar of fiscal stimulus results in additional GDP of between fifty cents and one dollar).Accordingly, the Government has estimated that the Economic Security Strategy would support the employment of up to 75,000 people, based on an employment elasticity of 0.75 (that is, each 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth is associated, on average, with a 0.75 percentage point increase in employment). The bulk of the impact occurs in the year immediately following the implementation of the ESS measures.The Budget provided more detail on the combined impacts of the stimulus packages, including the ESS, on a quarterly basis. The quarterly impact of the packages in supporting jobs builds up to a peak of 210,000 by the June quarter 2010.</DOC>

The Government's estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a dollar of fiscal stimulus increases GDP by a multiplier of between 0.5 and 1, as outlined in my answer to House of Representatives Question No. 523. Infrastructure spending is generally expected to have a multiplier at the higher end of this range. Each additional 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to support up to 75,000 jobs.The employment effects of spending over several years are based on the same assumptions, but the number of jobs supported at any point in time will vary depending on the profile of the spending over time, so it is a more complex calculation. A succession of overlapping temporary spending measures will each add to employment for a period until the particular stimulus ceases and the employment associated with it returns after a time to pre-stimulus levels. As these spending measures progressively come on stream over time (and some of the employment created by the earlier measures finishes) the number of jobs supported by the spending increases to a peak and then declines.The Budget provided more detail on the combined impacts of all the stimulus packages, including the COAG measures, on a quarterly basis. The quarterly impact of the packages in supporting jobs builds up to a peak of 210,000 by the June quarter 2010.</DOC>

and (2) The Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAAWR), used by the Air Force continuously since 1946, is an essential resource for the development of fighter pilot air combat skills. The range enables F/A-18A/B Hornet, Hawk 127 and Pilatus P/C-9 pilots to hone air to surface gunnery and inert practice bombing skills.Between January 2008 to January 2009, the Air Force's Hawk 127s and F/A-18A/B Hornets flew a total of 176 missions that utilised the range.and (b) No.The Air Force currently uses 36 Defence practice areas and test ranges spread geographically around Australia.Studies in the late 1980s and 2000 concluded that there were no suitable or viable alternative sites for an air weapons range for aircraft based at RAAF Williamtown. These studies also stated that the nearby Singleton range was assessed as unsuitable for the Air Force's requirements. Analysis of alternative basing structures indicates that the RAAF Williamtown/Salt Ash Air Weapons Range construct is the most cost effective means of achieving air combat training for Defence.4.9 per cent.Defence has no current plans to acquire noise affected properties around the range.Defence representatives from the Air Force and the Defence Support Group regularly meet with local, state and Federal representatives as part of the Williamtown Consultative Forum to discuss issues of local concern, including the weapons range.No.Yes.Studies regarding the requirement for the use of SAAWR by the Joint Strike Fighter are currently underway, and are not expected to be completed until next year. However, initial indications are that the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter will lead to reduced Range usage.Defence funded extensive noise testing of the Joint Strike Fighter in late 2008 to better understand the noise characteristics and validate the early noise data. The tests indicate that, while not as noisy as originally expected, the JSF will be noisier than current F/A-18 A/B Hornet aircraft in some phases of flight but is less noisy in others. For example, the JSF will be quieter than the F/A-18 A/B in cruise and approach but will be noisier on take-off.Defence has no current plans to acquire noise affected properties around the range.Yes, the range was included in the Defence Strategic Training Area and Ranges Review, which was conducted in 2008. Defence will consider the review later this year.To align the capability, force disposition and sustainability requirements of the Australian Defence Force's training areas and test ranges for the longer term.It was conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff, with PS Management Consultants taking the management and technical lead. No consultation external to Defence was undertaken.The review has already been conducted.Further studies regarding the requirement for the use of SAAWR by the Joint Strike Fighter are currently underway.</DOC>

The departmental appropriations of agencies do not lapse and underspends are retained by the relevant agency. Administered appropriations lapse and underspends are returned to the Budget.The Attorney-General's Department had an underspend against its administered appropriation of $112.930 million. Of this amount, $36.893 million has been moved from the 2007-08 financial year to the 2008-09 financial year as part of the 2008-09 Budget process and Additional Estimates process. The Attorney-General's Department therefore returned $76.037 million as a result of underspends against administered appropriation in the 2007-08 financial year.The Federal Magistrates Court had an underspend against its administered appropriation of $0.3 million. The Federal Magistrates Court therefore returned $0.3 million as a result of underspends against administered appropriation in the 2007-08 financial year.The Australian Federal Police had an underspend against its administered appropriation of $9.5 million. The Australian Federal Police therefore returned $9.5 million as a result of underspends against administered appropriation in the 2007-08 financial year.The National Capital Authority had an underspend against its administered appropriation of $0.66 million.

There is little risk of Australian Government borrowing crowding out private sector investment. The Government's borrowing requirements are relatively small when compared with GDP and the overall size of credit markets.The Government can provide important support for economic activity by borrowing to fund public expenditure when growth in private domestic demand is slowing. Demand for funds by the private sector is typically lower during periods of weaker domestic demand.Prior to the financial crisis, banks sourced a significant portion of their funding from overseas borrowings. While overseas borrowing remains an important source of funding, its cost has increased following the crisis due to a repricing of risk.The Government's guarantee of wholesale funding assists Australian banks to raise funds both domestically and offshore so that they can continue to lend to Australian businesses and households. This is helping to support economic activity at a time when the economic outlook is uncertain.All Australian borrowers have been impacted by the dislocation in global and domestic capital markets and the resulting repricing of credit. While the banks maintain that, due to elevated funding costs, they have been unable to pass on the full official cash rate reductions to borrowers, including small businesses borrowers, the Government has strongly encouraged the banks to do so.Without the guarantee on bank wholesale funding, banks would not have been able to maintain lending to households and businesses and would have charged much higher interest rates on what lending they did undertake.</DOC>

The National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy will not evaluate programs prior to 2008. Evaluation of previous activities will be undertaken as part of the operation of those activities., (c) and (d) There has not been a public consultation process on the National Action Plan. The major elements of the National Action Plan have been progressed through individual negotiations on the National Partnership for Literacy and Numeracy (NP) and the Literacy and Numeracy Pilots in Low SES communities (the Pilots).and (g) The Pilots were agreed to by MCEETYA in June 2008, and progressed via negotiation with state, territory and non government education authorities as funding agreements. The NP was agreed to by COAG in November 2008 and is being progressed via negotiation with state and territory education departments. In addition, a Pilots forum was held in October 2008, involving state, territory and non government education authorities, school principals and academic partners, on the pilot guidelines and to agree an approach to capturing pilot outcomes.To date, the outcome of negotiation on the Pilots is the establishment of thirty funding agreements with state, territory and non government education authorities for the conduct of the literacy and numeracy pilots across Australia. The outcome of negotiation on the NP is that state and territory implementation plans for the NP are expected be finalised by October 2009.Funding for An Even Start: National Tuition Program, Summer Schools for Teachers Program and the Rewarding Schools for Improving Literacy and Numeracy Outcomes Program has been redirected into the National Action Plan for Literacy and Numeracy.The guidelines for the operation of the NP are set out in the National Partnership Agreement for Literacy and Numeracy.

The Nation Building and Jobs Plan is made up of a number of elements of which Building the Education Revolution is one.The Government's estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a stimulus of 1 per cent of GDP can be expected to increase GDP growth by between Â½ and 1 percentage point. This is based on the assumption of a fiscal multiplier of between 0.5 and 1 (that is, each additional dollar of fiscal stimulus results in additional GDP of between fifty cents and one dollar). Estimates of the number of jobs supported by stimulus measures are derived using an employment elasticity of 0.75 (that is, each 1Â percentage point increase in GDP growth is associated, on average, with a 0.75Â percentage point increase in employment).The Budget provided estimates of the combined impacts of the Government's stimulus packages. The stimulus packages are expected to raise GDP by 2Â¾ per cent in 2009-10 and 1Â½ per cent in 2010-11, supporting up to 210,000 jobs.The Building the Education Revolution program builds on the Government's commitment to deliver a world-class education to all Australian schools. The funding provided will help to stimulate national and local economies through the scale and pace of construction work undertaken.The Commonwealth has in place with each state and territory education authority a Bilateral Agreement on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This agreement includes a requirement for reporting and performance benchmarks. At the commencement of a project, state and territory education authorities are required to submit details of the estimated numbers of jobs to be supported by the project. This includes the numbers of Indigenous and non-Indigenous apprentices/trainees and other workers. The first monthly reporting is due to be submitted by education authorities to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations by 15Â JuneÂ 2009.The key performance indicator for the Building the Education Revolution is the number of new or refurbished facilities, including libraries and multipurpose halls in primary schools and science and language laboratories in secondary schools.The Commonwealth will measure this key performance indicator by measuring:funding application rounds undertaken;construction milestones met and milestone payments made;completion of projects on time;amount of funding spent; andnumber of jobs supported through Building the Education Revolution projects.</DOC>

For the purpose of funding under the Building the Education Revolution (BER), schools with multiple campuses will be treated as a single school. For non-government schools, this is defined by whether the school is recognised separately under the Schools Assistance Act 2008
(i.e. with a separate Socio Economic Status (SES) score and entitlement to General Recurrent Grants).Sunrise Christian School (covering the five campuses) has a single SES score and receives only one payment in relation to the General Recurrent Grants and is, therefore, classified as a single school for the purposes of BER. The notional allocation of funding for the school has been based on the combined full time equivalent (FTE) enrolments for all its campuses.On 3 April 2009, I wrote to Sunrise Christian School advising them of the BER Guidelines as they relate to multi-purpose schools. I am advised that my Department wrote to the school in a similar fashion on 23 March 2009.The treatment of multi-campus schools under the BER is consistent with other Federal Government funding programs, such as the National Secondary School Computer Fund and Local Schools Working Together program.According to my Department's records, there are 274 multi-campus schools in Australia.</DOC>

&amp; (2) I was not previously aware of the details of the proposal in question.Officers from my Department have confirmed with the New South Wales Crown Lands Department that the threatened species Acacia terminalis subsp terminalis occurs on the North Manly site.The New South Wales Crown Lands Department also indicated that the land will be withdrawn from sale and reserved under the CrownÂ LandsÂ ActÂ 1989Â (NSW) for an appropriate conservation purpose and ongoing management of the site will be assigned to Warringah Council.The Australian Government can assist private conservation organisations and state conservation agencies to purchase priority land for conservation, by providing up to two-thirds of the land purchase price. To take advantage of this initiative, a buyer who is interested in purchasing the land to manage it for conservation as part of the National Reserve System would need to come forward. Provided the prospective purchaser has one-third of the money to support the purchase, they would be able to seek funding to purchase the land under the Australian Government's Caring for our Country initiative.In reference to the parcel of land at 13A Amourin Street, North Manly, an initial assessment of the conservation values of this parcel of land against national priorities reveals that while there may be local or regional values on the parcel, other parcels of land may have a higher priority for inclusion in the NRS.</DOC>

The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) commissioned the University of Wollongong in MarchÂ 2007 to independently review the Veterans' Home Care (VHC) program with the aim of identifying what changes may be necessary to ensure that the program continues to meet the needs of the veteran community. The review was finalised in March 2008 and the report is available to the public via the DVA website at www.dva.gov.au/health/homecare/mainvhc.htm. Overall, the review found that the VHC program is well targeted and accepted by the veteran community but there are some opportunities for improvement.The Government is currently considering the findings of the independent review. These considerations may result in changes to the VHC program. The Government has ruled out reducing services or scrapping the VHC program.The Government has already addressed one of the key findings of the review by deciding to revise the VHC assessment instrument to improve the way veterans and war widow/widowers are assessed for VHC services. This instrument is being validated by an independent expert and is expected to be implemented in late 2009.The Government also announced an initiative in the recent Budget to improve and better coordinate the assessment processes for the HomeFront, Rehabilitation Appliances Program (RAP) and VHC programs. The aim of these programs is to help veterans and war widow/widowers maintain their independence, stay in their own homes for longer and delay entry into residential aged care. This initiative will further strengthen the assessment process for VHC services and ensure more targeted referrals from VHC to programs such as RAP and HomeFront.DVA sets the fees paid to VHC service providers under its contractual arrangement with them to deliver VHC services to veterans and war widow/widowers. These fees are indexed annually on 1 January of each year in line with government indexation arrangements. Fees were indexed on 1 January 2009 and will be indexed again on 1 January 2010.No.</DOC>

The Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) has an approved Transport Security Program (TSP).Virgin Blue and Rex have their own approved TSPs.Â  Jetstar is included under the QANTAS Group approved TSP.No.None put in place by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government.TSP does not require the provision of secure car parking at Sydney Airport for employees of Virgin Blue, Rex Airlines and Jetstar.Â  The provision of such parking for QANTAS staff is not a requirement under their approved TSP.Â  The provision of parking is not a feature of the TSP as it is not required under the Aviation Transport Security Act (ATSA) or Aviation Transport Security Regulations (ATSR).Secure staff car parking is a commercial matter between airports and airlines.Â  I understand that the situation in Australia's capital city airports varies both in terms of whether secure parking is provided, and whether any secure parking is available to staff generally or is limited to pilots, engineers and cabin crew.I am not aware of any such standard or practice.Â  From an international perspective it does not feature in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention.</DOC>

State and Territory Governments outlined to the Commonwealth the proposed repair and maintenance work that could be undertaken and these were approved by the Minister for Housing. Working with the States and Territories, the Commonwealth's objective is to maximise the economic stimulatory impact of the funding and to maximise the improvements to social housing stock in Australia.Details of projects approved were tabled by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 27 May 2009.The average cost of repair and maintenance work for all projects is $7,515.00 per dwelling, there is no separate breakdown of costs available for repair or maintenance work.A total of 10,702 dwellings are either vacant now or will become uninhabitable within two years, without the approved repair and maintenance work.The nature of repairs and maintenance vary significantly. Minor repairs are being completed promptly and all repairs and maintenance are scheduled to be completed by 30 June 2010.No, there is an agreed implementation plan with each jurisdiction, and all repairs and maintenance work are scheduled to be completed by 30 June 2010.State and Territory Governments are contracting directly with the building industry to complete these repairs.</DOC>

Legislation and policy exists to address the situation where listed securities become frozen. 
Â 
Centrelink has applied these rules and has not required further guidance.
Social security legislation defines listed securities as financial investments. This means for income test purposes the deeming rules are applied to the gross market value of the investment regardless of whether dividends are paid. The actual returns from the customer's investments, whether in the form of capital growth, dividends or interest, are not used for income assessment, rather the current deeming rates are used to calculate assessable income.
For assets test purposes, the net market value (gross value less any encumbrance secured against the asset) is assessed.
To determine the asset value for shares, the last selling price for shares on the Australian Stock Exchange is used. Updated prices are applied to assessments at automatic bulk updates on 20Â March and 20Â September every year and when a customer asks for a re-assessment.
If a financial investment fundamentally fails the Minister is able to provide an exemption from the deeming rules in certain circumstances. Customers wanting to request a deeming exemption should contact their local Centrelink Financial Information officer to discuss the appropriateness of the request in their circumstances and the documentation required to progress a request.
Â 
 Where a deeming exemption is granted, the actual returns, if any, are assessed under the income test.</DOC>

Labor's national plan to tackle the water crisis included a commitment to provide 'Up to $124 million further investment in the Wimmera Mallee pipeline project to ensure the project is completed and water savings delivered as soon as possible'.The Government has approved funding of $99Â million to fast-track completion of the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline and consistent with the Government's commitment, a further $25 million is potentially available to complete this project, should it be required.Whilst the pipeline will provide a reliable and pressurised water supply that will enhance fire fighting capacity, the purpose of this investment is to improve water supply security for a large part of the north-west region of Victoria and to provide water to enhance environmental outcomes. Â These objectives are consistent with those of the Government's $12.9 billion Water for the Future framework, from which this project is being funded.Regarding funding for fire services requirements, States and Territories have primary responsibility for preparing and responding to emergencies within their jurisdictions.Â  However, as part of the budget, the Government announced a 'Disaster Resiliance Australia Package' valued at $79.3 million, aimed at strengthening efforts to prepare for and combat major natural disasters, including fires.Â  The Commonwealth also provides funding of $14 million per year under the National Aerial Firefighting Arrangements to assist the States and Territories lease specialised fire fighting aircraft.Regarding the rehabilitation of the Horsham Irrigation District (Wimmera Irrigation Area), Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water was successful in obtaining $80,000 in funding under Round 1 of the Australian Government Irrigation Modernisation Planning Assistance program.Â  I understand Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water has publicly announced that, in close consultation with the Wimmera Irrigators and Diverters Consultative Committee, it will develop a business case to facilitate the permanent closure of the Wimmera irrigation system.</DOC>

I cannot divulge the precise details requested in the question, for the following reasons:Many of the formal arrangements between governments are confidential.Â  In such cases, it is inappropriate to disclose the contents without the consent of the other signatory.Release of information and inability to maintain confidentiality can potentially disadvantage Australia in future negotiations with other countries and would be contrary to Australia's national interest.However, publicly available information about some Intergovernmental Agreements can be obtained from the COAG website http://www.coag.gov.au. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also maintains a website: http://www.dfat.gov.au/ treaties/that lists all treaties (agreements. conventions and protocols that create binding obligations under international law) to which Australia is a signatory.</DOC>

http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/ (which can also be found on the DFAT website: http://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/.)Accordingly my answers are as follows:On 30 June 2009, the number of treaties maintained by DFAT with the Australian Treaties Library was 2659. I am responsible for all Australian treaties (although other ministers may also have auxiliary responsibility for given treaties owing to their subject matter). Accordingly, I consider that, for the purposes of answering the question, all 2659 treaties maintained by DFAT within the Australian Treaties Library exist in my portfolio, rather than the portfolio of the Minister for Trade.

To provide the detailed information sought would entail a significant diversion of resources and, when the names and texts of these treaties are freely available from the Australian Treaties Library, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.The objectives and purposes of these treaties are usually set out in the preamble of each treaty. Where there is no preamble to the treaty then the object and purpose of the treaty should be clear from the text of the treaty.

I refer to the Honourable Member to the COAG and DFAT websites, which list the intergovernmental agreements signed at COAG meetings and the treaties to which Australia is a signatory respectively.Details of additional agreements are provided in the table below and copies attached as appropriate:Notes:Intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia and other governments and multilateral intergovernmental institutions, in which ANSTO has an interest are part of the Department of Foreign Affairs' Treaties Database and the science and technology agreements facilitated by the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.ANSTO as an entity is also a party to various agreements with international multi-lateral agencies including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia and the Nuclear Energy Agency. In addition, ANSTO has bi-lateral arrangements including but not limited to government agencies in the Republic of Korea, Germany, Argentina and France. However, the precise detail requested in the question is not readily available and would be resource intensive to provide.Pursuant to CSIRO's enabling legislation (Science and Industry Research Act 1949 (SIR Act) (Cth)), CSIRO is established as a body corporate and is legally separate from the Commonwealth. As a Commonwealth Authority governed by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, CSIRO is also financially separate from the Commonwealth. In this regard, CSIRO differs from government departments and agencies governed by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and has separate powers and obligations from FMA Act bodies. CSIRO is not empowered under the SIR Act to enter into 'intergovernmental agreements' and is unable to bind the Commonwealth legally or financially by entering into international agreements on behalf of the Commonwealth.

Seven States and Territories submitted draft or final proposals for the 2008-09 financial year on or before 2 March 2009.The Northern Territory submitted its proposal on 5 March 2009. Final proposals were received from New South Wales on 20 March 2009, Western Australia on 10 March 2009 and South Australia on 12 March 2009.The combined monetary value of the proposals received was $303,197,099. This is an estimate as some States and Territories provided the total cost of projects that will be undertaken over the two years and for these the costs were evenly divided over the two years.The Australian Government has entered into bilateral agreements with all States and Territories in respect of their 2008-09 proposals.As at 7 June 2009 the Australian Government had paid the following amounts:New South Wales - $65.201 million;Victoria - $49.576 million;Queensland - $40.048 million.Western Australia - $20.244 million;South Australia - $14.990 million;Tasmania - $4.662 million;The Australian Capital Territory - $3.221 million; andThe Northern Territory - $2.058 million.</DOC>

Plastics 4 (Low Density Polyethylene) and 5 (Polypropylene) are collected for recycling by local government kerbside systems in most metropolitan and some regional areas across Australia. They are also accepted by some recycling depots and transfer stations. Their inclusion in kerbside recycling is a matter for local government who will generally consider the costs, benefits and practicalities of collecting these plastics in their region. Plastics 4 and 5 are processed at facilities across Australia.Where plastic with a Plastics Identification Code of 6 (polystyrene) are available in commercially viable quantities, services are available for their collection and recycling. Polystyrene is also collected for recycling by some local government kerbside systems. While the majority of polystyrene collected for recycling is exported for processing, there is a plant in Mildura in Victoria which utilises recycled polystyrene to produce products including posts, bollards and stakes.Plastics with a Plastics Identification Code of 1, 2 and 3 are collected for recycling by most local government kerbside systems, recycling depots and transfer stations. Processing facilities for these plastics are located across Australia.Plastics with a Plastics Identification Code of 4, 5 and 6 can be recycled.</DOC>

The Government supports the effective management of flying fox populations and their impact through contributions to research.Fruit growing levypayers may wish to propose that Horticulture Australia Limited (HAL) sponsor research into flying foxes and non-lethal control measures. HAL makes an annual industry call for proposals around September each year that address specific industry priorities.HAL funds priority research on behalf of 26 statutory levy-paying horticultural industries and other industries and organisations that make voluntary contributions (including the stonefruit and apple/pear bodies). The government matches, on a dollar for dollar basis, industry contributions (both statutory and voluntary) paid to HAL for research up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry.The on-farm agricultural production and native animal management aspects relating to flying foxes are state and territory responsibilities and associated mainly with state/territory legislation. Agencies in those jurisdictions are working with affected fruit growers to manage the extent of damage on their orchards and crops.Funding assistance through state governments is available to growers for non-lethal methods to control flying fox damage to their orchards, such as netting.In Queensland the Primary Industry Productivity Enhancement Scheme makes available low interest loads of up to $500,000, which can be repaid over a 20 year period, to establish control methods.In NSW the Special Conservation Scheme makes available loans for exclusion netting. These loans are for up to fifteen years and for 90% of the net cost of the netting up to a maximum of $150,000.</DOC>

Yes.No.There are no protocols, processes or legal requirements that must be fulfilled to have the WLS of the ATST-EM publicly recognised.No decision has been made to publicly announce recognition of WLS for ATST-EM veterans who served on active service in East Timor.and (6) There is no requirement for public recognition to qualify for the award of the War Service Pension. Personnel wishing to access veterans' entitlements associated with their service in ATST-EM can do so once Department of Veterans' Affairs has confirmed their service with Defence.I am advised that the Army understands that in 2001 an investigation was commissioned by the then Commander of the Australian Contingent  -  East Timor into how the Australian Training Support Team  -  East Timor received the UNTAET medal, as they were not assigned to the United Nations. In 2003, it is further understood that a direction was issued that the medals had been issued in error and that they be withdrawn. Action was initiated by the Army to comply with this direction.The UNTAET Medal can only be authorised for issue by the Security Council of the United Nations.In July 2008, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force wrote to the United Nations Headquarters Military Adviser, Lieutenant General Chikadibia Obiakor, requesting that he, as the delegate for the award of the United Nations medals, agree to the retrospective award of the UNTAET Medal to the 205 members of the ATST-EM who served during the period 1 March 2001 to 25 July 2005.Defence was passed a response from the United Nations dated 23 December 2008 advising that the United Nations Secretariat has not approved retrospective award of the medal to ATST-EM members.There are no further avenues available to Defence to influence the award of the UNTAET Medal to ATST-EM members, although individuals may apply to the United Nations for reconsideration of their specific circumstance.</DOC>

The time taken to finalise a labour agreement can vary considerably depending on the complexity of the agreement; the number and type of concessions sought, the quality of the information provided and the response times of the employer. It generally takes around four months to prepare a labour agreement, and they can be finalised in about four weeks following provision of the required documentation. In exceptional circumstances, it can take up to two years to finalise an agreement.The standard Subclass 457 sponsorship arrangement allows sponsors to nominate only people with occupations that are on an occupation list approved for this program. Labour agreements provide flexibility by allowing employers experiencing skills shortages in other occupations or approved occupations who cannot meet the full requirements for the standard Subclass 457 sponsorship arrangement, to negotiate with the Commonwealth approval to nominate skilled overseas workers.There were 2,950 primary visa holders in South Australia at 30 April 2009. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship does not collect data that would indicate whether a visa holder is willing to relocate to more remote areas in pursuit of training and employment.</DOC>

The changes are being rolled out when the legislation and systems changes can be made. This change required minor alterations and could be implemented earlier than some other changes.No. (ii) No. The changed arrangements require all applications not finalised on 15 May 2009 to pursue a labour agreement. Applicants who have an existing application not finalised under standard business sponsorship provisions are invited to withdraw their applications and seek a refund of the fee. The government introduced the changes to ensure that employers using the Subclass 457 visa program to access ASCO 5-7 occupations satisfy obligations on local training and employment.</DOC>

The Australian pipeline network includes high pressure transmission and low pressure distribution components. The National Inventory Team, part of the Department of Climate Change, compiles emissions data for the purposes of producing the National Greenhouse Accounts. As part of this, it estimates emissions and fuel use separately for high pressure gas transmission and low pressure gas distribution networks. It advised that in 2006-07, the energy use in high pressure natural gas transmission totalled 17 PJ (resulting in 858 kilotonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions). The additional energy use in national gas production and low pressure distribution totalled 6 PJ (resulting in 320 kilotonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions). While the latter figure is not disaggregated, approximately two-thirds (4 PJ) is used in gas distribution.The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism has not provided any advice to Minister Ferguson on how these emissions might be reduced.</DOC>

What evidence is there to justify claims that there are poor literacy levels among Australian school children?In 2008, the National Assessment Program  -  Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) commenced in Australian schools. The NAPLAN identifies student achievement of essential literacy and numeracy skills. A key part of this process is the identification of those students who have not achieved the minimum national standard for their year level and, who need further help to achieve the skills they require to continue in schooling.The data from the NAPLAN test results gives schools and systems the ability to compare their students' achievements against national standards and with student achievement in other states and territories. It also allows the monitoring of progress over time.Results from the 2008 NAPLAN tests indicate that at the national level, across the literacy domains and year levels, on average about 80 per cent of students are above the national minimum standard, about 13 per cent are achieving at the national minimum standard and about 7 cent are below the national minimum standard.For Indigenous students at the national level, across the literacy domains and year levels, on average about 44 per cent of Indigenous students are above the national minimum standard, about 23 per cent are achieving at the national minimum standard and about 33 per cent are below the national minimum standard.The results for all year levels and domains can be found in the 2008 National Report at http://www.naplan.edu.au/.Where is Australia placed on the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparison on national literacy levels?57 countries participated in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2006 and the results were released in December 2007.Australia's mean score for reading literacy in PISA 2006 was 513 points, above the OECD average of 492 points. This represented a statistically significant decline from Australia's mean score in PISA 2003 of 525 points.Australia was significantly outperformed by five countries in PISA 2006: Korea (556), Finland (547), Hong Kong-China (536), Canada (527) and New Zealand (521). Australia performed at a level with no statistically significant difference or not significantly different to Ireland, Liechtenstein, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands and outperformed all other participating countries.Australia was outperformed by only two countries, Finland and Korea, in PISA 2003.

Funding under the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program is allocated based on full time enrolments at schools. As the students at schools with transient student populations are enrolled at other schools, funding has been provided to those other schools for those students, who are expected to return to their local school and so benefit from the funding. As such, no BER funding is available for schools with transient student populations.The Local Schools Working Together Program is aimed at partnerships to build shared educational facilities. The preferred partnership is between a government and non-government school but it may include a partnership within the educational sector along with a third party. Under this arrangement a school with a transient student population could be a partner with another school eligible to receive recurrent funding under the Schools Assistance Act 2008.</DOC>

The Australian Government believes that every parent has the right to choose an education that best suits the needs of their child, irrespective of their religious beliefs. I acknowledge that regular schools are not available or may not be suitable for all children and therefore distance education fulfils a need.The Government provides funding for distance education students that are using registered distance education facilities which are part of a registered non-government school.The Australian Government provides funding for students educated at government schools under the National Education Agreement. It is each state and territory's responsibility to determine its priorities in the provision of education, including distance education.</DOC>

Mr Pyne's question is specific to 'school leavers'. There is not a national administrative data collection of school leaver numbers, and hence percentages can not be derived as requested.However the Australian Bureau of Statistics' annual 'Survey of Education and Work' publishes estimates of school leavers aged 15 to 24 years, and their study destinations. The survey estimates that there were 302 100 school leavers in 2006, 303 100 in 2007, and 313 600 in 2008.Enrolments at bachelor degree level or above were estimated at 82 600 in 2006, or 27.3 per cent of school leavers, at 83 600 in 2007 (27.6 per cent), and 83 900 in 2008 (26.8 per cent). Enrolments in vocational studies were estimated at 79 200 in 2006, or 26.2 per cent of school leavers, at 82 300 in 2007 (27.2 per cent), and 89 000 in 2008 (28.4 per cent).In the 2009-10 Budget $2 657 482 000 was allocated for funding for training to VET Providers, including TAFE's. This includes funding provided to states and territories to fund their VET training systems through the Inter Government Agreement on Federal Financial Relations and the VET infrastructure component of the Education Infrastructure Fund.In prior years, under the Skilling Australia's Workforce Act 2005 and the 2005-2008 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia's Workforce, States and Territories were required to contribute base recurrent funding on a 2:1 ratio to Commonwealth government funding, plus match the Commonwealth on additional recurrent funding. All States and Territories met or exceeded this requirement during the period of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Agreement.Under the new Inter Government Agreement there is no specific requirement in terms of the amount to be contributed by States and Territories.In the 2009-10 Budget $6 350 955 000 was allocated for 2009-10 for the higher education sector (including universities and other eligible bodies) through the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio. This excludes funding to universities through the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio.This also excludes funding allocated for Commonwealth Scholarships administered by higher education providers, Higher Education Loan Program assistance for students and Education Investment Fund VET projects.</DOC>

Yes. At the White Ribbon Foundation's White Tie Dinner held in September 2008, the Prime Minister publicly announced $2 million would be invested to benchmark community attitudes on domestic violence and sexual assault. The household phone survey was a key component of this project.A total of 12,900 people nationally - comprising a general national community survey of 10,000 people; 2,500 persons from selected Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds; and 400 Indigenous Australians.None. The survey is being conducted by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation in association with the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Social Research Centre.As at 20 June 2009, $1.8million of the allocated $2million had been paid. The balance is payable on completion of the survey later this year.The survey includes modules that assess community attitudes of what constitutes domestic violence, sexual violence and sexual harassment; understanding of the consequences or harm caused by violence; whether violence is ever excusable; myths and beliefs about victims and perpetrators; and impacts of previous awareness campaigns.To gauge contemporary Australian attitudes on domestic violence and sexual assault to provide a baseline from which to measure the outcomes of future national anti-violence initiatives and improve the Government's understanding of strategies that are effective in reducing violence.Because the 2009 survey is intended to provide a benchmark, it will be necessary to repeat it at subsequent intervals to measure attitudinal change to violence against women and their children. At this stage no date has been set for the next survey.The current survey asks no questions about domestic meals and it is not anticipated that such a question would be asked in any future survey.</DOC>

In November 2008, COAG endorsed 3 Smarter Schools National Partnerships (NP) designed to drive educational reforms in Australian schools. The NPs are available at www.coag.gov.au.The systems have worked together to develop arrangements for implementation of the NPs in each state and territory, and have agreed a methodology for the distribution of funds. This has been a process of negotiation between the Government and non-government sectors and the Commonwealth welcomes the collaborative approach taken by all school systems.The states and territories have developed Preliminary Implementation Plans and Bilateral Agreements triggering the initial flow of funding to each sector to facilitate reforms.The Commonwealth will continue to work with states and territories to further refine the Preliminary Implementation Plans with Final Implementation Plans expected to be in place in October 2009The Final Implementation Plans will be publically released after they have been finalised in late 2009.States and territories will match the level of investment for the funds paid under the facilitation component across the three NPs. The proportion of each sector's contribution to this co-investment will be negotiated between the sectors.School sectors within each State and Territory will negotiate the share and source of each sector's contribution to the co-investment. The sectors will need to determine an appropriate approach to this, taking into consideration the effects at the school level including for small independent schools.The methodology for the indicative distribution of facilitation funding differs across the three Smarter Schools NPs. For the Improving Teacher Quality NP this has been determined on the basis of state shares of the national Full-Time Equivalent teaching staff; for the Low SES School Communities NP this has been determined by student enrolments in disadvantaged schools and the school-aged population who reside in the most disadvantaged Census Collection Districts; and for the Literacy and Numeracy NP it has been determined by the total number of students at or below minimum standards (NAPLAN 2008) in reading and numeracy for Years 3, 5 and 7.The states and territories will provide reports to the Commonwealth against the implementation milestones, achievement of reform targets and timelines, for both the Government and non-government sector, as detailed in Bilateral Agreements.</DOC>

In the last six months more than 1,100 Renewable Remote Power Generation Program (RRPGP) extension pre-purchase applications have been submitted. This compares with around 6,000 applications over the previous seven years. Industry had been given notice that the program was approaching full commitment.The RRPGP extension funding became fully committed. Giving a notice period would have resulted in a rush of applications that would have exceeded the funds available.In the period between 22 June and 10 July 2009, 194 RRPGP extension pre - purchase applications were received requesting approval for a total of $4.268 million in funding.Where it was clear that the pre-purchase application had been posted before 8:30am on 22 June 2009, the pre-purchase application was assessed for eligibility under the relevant sub-program guidelines.In other cases, a letter was sent to the applicant and copied to the supplier. This letter indicated that the pre-purchase application was not accepted for assessment and detailed the requirements for this decision to be reconsidered.</DOC>

The Australian Government is aware of the continuing threat to shark species domestically and internationally, especially trade in shark fin and is firmly committed to ensuring the best practise conservation and management of shark species.The practice of shark finning, where the fins are removed and the trunk of the shark is discarded at sea, is not permitted in fisheries managed by the Australian Government, nor does Australia condone the practice of shark finning.Australia takes a lead role internationally to ensure regional and global shark populations are managed sustainably and supports measures that encourage the full utilisation of sharks. The Australian Government has led efforts in regional fisheries management organisations, such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, to ensure the practice of shark finning is banned and has continued to strive for improved monitoring of shark catches and stronger compliance of management arrangements.The Australian Government has a compliance program, which incorporates the surveillance and apprehension of unlicensed foreign vessels fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone, including conducting deterrence and apprehension activities in tropical, temperate and cold water regions. This program has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of foreign vessels detected within the northern waters of the Australian Fishing Zone, where illegal shark fishing by foreign vessels has been most prevalent in the last few years.The Australian Government is also working to ensure that management arrangements in shark fisheries promote sustainable fishing practices and that shark species are not over-exploited.Â As part of its role in accrediting the export of products derived from Australia's fisheries, my Department works closely with fisheries management agencies from all jurisdictions to ensure fishing activities, including where shark are taken, are conducted on an ecologically sustainable basis.</DOC>

I have received responses from all State and Territories education ministers.All State and Territory governments recognise the importance of effective participation of small businesses in the implementation of the Building the Education Revolution program and have developed a range of measures to provide effective opportunities for small and local businesses.While tender processes vary between jurisdictions, all States and Territories have measures in place that will facilitate the use of local contractors or sub-contractors and provide information to local businesses on how to take up work opportunities. Some of these initiatives include on-line registration of interest, requiring contractors to engage local sub-contractors, and simplifying procurement processes.</DOC>

No external consultants were used to develop the Government's policy position on PPL. FaHCSIA led the policy work and the preparation of the booklet on PPL, with input from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the Department of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Treasury.$200,000 is allocated for evaluation activity. Any Baseline data needed for the evaluation should be collected prior to the PPL Scheme's commencement.$2.15 million is allocated for development of a communications and media campaign which will commence half-way through 2010. In order to have the communications and media campaign ready to commence half-way through 2010, expenditure is required in the financial year ending 30 June 2010. The purpose of the campaign is to ensure that parents, employers and the community are informed about how the scheme will operate.FaHCSIA has established a new branch to develop and implement the scheme from 1 July 2009.FaHCSIA was allocated resources for an Average Staffing Level (ASL) of 18 in the 2009 - 10 year, 18.33 in the 2010 - 11 year and 5 for the 2011-12 and subsequent years.FaHCSIA is leading the development and implementation of the scheme in close consultation with DEEWR and with input from other agencies.The scheme will be administered by the Family Assistance Office (Centrelink and Medicare Australia). The paymaster function will be administered and coordinated by Centrelink.The Government will be evaluating the Paid Parental Leave scheme and this will include monitoring the level of employer provided paid parental leave. The Government does not mandate the provision of paid parental leave by employers which is a matter for negotiation at the workplace levelThe costing of the scheme used Centrelink administrative data, ABS data and some of the assumptions used by the Productivity Commission in its final report.The modelling of the scheme was undertaken by the Productivity Commission and the results of this analysis are in Appendix L of its final report which has already been released.</DOC>

Dates, destinations, the purpose and costs of all official overseas travel are tabled in the Parliament every six months in a report titled 'Parliamentarians' Travel Paid by the Department of Finance and Deregulation'.Â The Minister and two advisers, Ben Pratt and Matt Levey, stayed at the location of the IWC meeting. Pestana Casino Park Hotel, Madeira. Staying at the location of the meeting was useful in enabling the Minister at attend the IWC meeting, and also to meet with many other attendees of the meeting who were staying at the meeting venue.In regard to the cost of accommodation please refer to answer 3 above.The Minister and all staff travelled within entitlement.The Minister held personal meetings with representatives from the following countries at the IWC meeting:ArgentinaBrazilChileFranceGermanyMexicoPortugalUnited KingdomUnited StatesIn his role as envoy, Mr Hollway undertakes strategic and ongoing diplomatic engagements on the Government's behalf, including travel as required, to an extent that Cabinet Ministers with broad portfolio responsibilities sometimes cannot. As Mr Garrett was able to attend the IWC meeting, it was not necessary for Mr Hollway to also attend, and therefore he did not. It is notable that the precedent of Ministers leading Australia's IWC delegation existed under the previous Government, however the previous Government did not appoint an envoy to engage in additional, strategic diplomacy outside of IWC annual meetings. It is also notable that Cabinet Ministers are the highest level of representation that has led Australia's IWC delegation to date.</DOC>

The Department has had a positive response from state and territory government authorities in relation to the National Solar Schools Program.The Department has recently entered into arrangements with education departments in five states (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia) to cooperatively deliver the program over 2008-09 and 2009-10. These cooperative delivery arrangements will provide $40 million to more than 1,100 government schools. The arrangements will obtain the best value for money for schools, maximise education outcomes and simplify and streamline participation by individual schools.The Department will work towards developing similar funding arrangements with the remaining jurisdictions in 2009-10.These cooperative delivery arrangements will provide $40 million to more than 1,100 government schools. The arrangements will obtain the best value for money for schools, maximise education outcomes and simplify and streamline participation by individual schools.The Department will work towards developing similar funding arrangements with the remaining jurisdictions in 2009-10.The only impediment we are aware of is the availability of installers given the extensive remaining installation demand created by the Solar Homes and Communities Plan.One hundred and six schools whose National Solar Schools funded projects include solar power systems have confirmed their solar panels have been installed at 23 July 2009. Many more schools are still awaiting installation or are in the process of having their solar power system installed.4Â Â Â Â Â  (a) to (e).

Final decisions had not been made at the time of the advice to preferred tenderers on 16 March 2009.Consistent with paragraph 4.14 of the Request for Tender (RFT), the period between 16 March 2009, when preferred tenderers received the without prejudice advice of their status, and 31 March 2009, when final decisions were made, gave preferred tenderers the opportunity to bring any issues, or other relevant matters, to the Department's attention. This was particularly critical where some organisations could have proposed to use the same subcontractor.Also, around that time the release of the new unemployment figures provided a more detailed picture of the extent of the impact of the Global Recession.A final review was undertaken to ensure that the level of service available in those locations was consistent with the demand for the service, and that job seekers, would be well serviced into the future by providing new services that would deliver better, more tailored assistance to job seekers, particular disadvantaged Australians, and place greater emphasis on assisting employers in addressing skills shortages.The department's final decision, made in accordance with the rules of the RFT, saw four organisations which were not initially identified as preferred tenderers that subsequently received an offer of Job Services Australia business and nine organisations which received business in additional Employment Service Areas.The Employment Service Areas where these changes were made were: Canterbury Bankstown NSW, Fairfield NSW, Inner Sydney NSW, Liverpool NSW, Macarthur NSW, Nepean NSW, Wollongong NSW, South Brisbane Qld, Northern Adelaide SA, Western Adelaide SA, Westgate Vic.

Following North Korea's nuclear test on 25 May 2009, the Government has had discussions with a range of countries at ministerial and officials level urging the imposition of further sanctions against North Korea. Following the adoption on 12 June 2009 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, the Government has made representations to a large number of other countries urging full enforcement of the sanctions mandated by that resolution and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 of 2006. Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, I do not intend to elaborate further as it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments.
As I announced in a media release issued on 12 July 2009, the Government has amended relevant regulations to implement in Australian law the sanctions mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, with effect from 11 July 2009. Australia has also implemented the non-mandatory provisions of Resolution 1874 calling on countries to restrict financial assistance to North Korea. The necessary frameworks are also being put in place to enable relevant Australian Government agencies to give effect, as required, to the other non-mandatory measures called for under Resolution 1874.These new measures are in addition to Australia's full implementation of the sanctions mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 of 2006, and the autonomous measures Australia has had in place against North Korea since 2006, including a general ban on visas for North Korean citizens, a ban on entry into Australian ports by North Korean-flagged vessels and financial restrictions against 12 North Korean entities and one individual. Australian bilateral development assistance to North Korea has been suspended since 2002.In addition to Australia's own implementation of sanctions against North Korea and our urging of other countries to fully enforce United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea, the Government has made direct representations to the Government of North Korea urging it to comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Most recently, on 9 June 2009 during a visit to North Korea, Australia's non-resident Ambassador to North Korea, H.E. Mr Sam Gerovich, made direct representations to H.E. Mr Kim Yong-nam, Head of State and President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, H.E. Mr Pak Ui-chun, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and senior North Korean officials, urging North Korea to comply fully with UN Resolutions.</DOC>

A final decision on the future use of the building has been postponed pending the outcome of a review into the ability of existing Defence and commercial aircraft painting facilities to meet the annual demand for Defence aircraft repainting. A decision is expected by late October 2009. In the interim, part of the aircraft painting facility is being used in support of overseas operations pending the refurbishment of permanent facilities elsewhere within RAAF Base Richmond.It is acknowledged that there is pressure for suitable maintenance accommodation at RAAFÂ Base Richmond. As such Defence is consideringÂ the adaptive re-use of the aircraft painting facility including the option to utilise it as a maintenance hanger.If not required for Defence aircraft repainting, upon its adaptive refit, the facility will be available for reallocation to other users based on the highest priority requirement.</DOC>

Additionally, customers can now claim FTB online. Online claims are generally processed within 14 days from the date they are received, provided all required information is available to assess the claim.From 1 July 2009 customers are no longer able to claim FTB through the ATO.Â  Prior to 1 July 2009, FTB claims lodged with the ATO were subject to timeframes as outlined in the Taxpayer's Charter.</DOC>

ATTACHMENT A
Realistic debate needed
 The Australian
CLIMATE change is a global problem, requiring a global solution. Key to this will be demonstrating the capacity to reconcile reductions in greenhouse gas emissions with sustained economic growth and rising living standards.
 the best way to define Australia's national emissions target and the treatment of trade-exposed emission-intensive sectors.In considering the merits of alternative proposals it is important to consider whether they contribute to an effective global response and help Australian businesses and households prepare for a low-carbon future. Australia is extraordinarily exposed to the adverse effects of global climate change and, given the structure of our economy, to poorly designed policy responses in other countries.As a result, our national interest is best served by achieving significant reductions in global greenhouse emissions, along with a smooth and rapid transition to a more carbon-efficient economy. Measures that delay this global transition will add to the extent and cost of climate change to which we will inevitably have to adapt. While they may also appear to deliver some short-term benefits - in terms of growth to some of our industries - this will come at a long-term cost.Australia, among developed countries, can ill-afford to forgo the benefits of more decisive global action.The first proposal is that Australia should base its national target on the consumption of emissions within the country. That is, we would be responsible for the emissions of all goods consumed within our borders. In contrast, the production-based approach that underpins existing international accounting practices, and the national targets under the Kyoto Protocol, counts all greenhouse gas emissions produced within our borders.Put simply, the consumption approach would make Australia responsible for all emissions released in the manufacturing process of any goods we import but absolve us from responsibility for the emissions released when we produce goods for export.The first act of the Rudd Government was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, where national emissions targets are defined in terms of the production-based approach.Short of abrogating Kyoto, any change in how we account for our total emissions would need to wait until after 2013, even if it could be included in future international arrangements. While it can be tempting to try to completely rewrite the rules of the game at each international negotiation, the reality is that getting agreement across all countries to serious global emissions reductions is already difficult.Unless there is a fundamental flaw in the architecture, it is generally better to make adjustments within the present framework rather than providing opportunities for others to hide their unwillingness to act.Moving to a consumption-based framework is unlikely to provide greater emissions reductions and could seriously deflect international attention from the main game: the need to deliver an effective global response. Shifting to a consumption basis would require the emissions embodied in all traded goods to be measured. This would require a huge global effort to develop and enforce credible, internationally consistent emissions accounts for all traded goods, regardless of their country of origin and the amount of emissions they embody.To illustrate, Australia would need to know the emissions produced, for example, during all Chinese manufacturing processes. If Chinese products also used inputs from a third country, say Germany, Australia would need this information to measure embodied emissions. This would be overwhelmingly complex. The alternative of ad hoc national approaches would invite a wave of protectionism under the guise of fighting climate change.Moving to a consumption-based approach without robust global accounting would involve significant risks for a small open economy such as Australia's.The green paper acknowledges that emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sectors require special treatment in the lead-up to a comprehensive global agreement being reached. That is why it proposes transitional assistance for this sector.The allocation of free permits proposed in the green paper delivers most of the advantages of implementing a consumption-based approach.This supports the competitiveness of emissions-intensive industries in a way that meets our international obligations without complicating and delaying efforts to get genuine global agreement.The second issue is whether the national cap should be adjusted to allow for emissions from new emissions-intensive trade-exposed projects. This approach is superficially appealing as it removes some of the difficult decisions associated with operating in a world where carbon pollution must be limited, by effectively removing the limit for a very important and pollution-intensive sector. Our priority in international negotiations is to encourage all countries to take on binding commitments to deliver a global solution.Exempting emissions from new investments would risk Australia being seen as self-serving. This would severely constrain our capacity to influence the global solution in ways that serve Australia's long-term national interests.Of course, it is not in Australia's interest for international greenhouse arrangements to perpetuate a two-zone approach to emissions reductions, where high-income nations face a carbon price and developing nations do not.But adopting a 'you first' or 'you pay' approach to emissions reductions would simply add our voice to those that wish to delay resolving this distortion. Instead, our best response is to make the case for encouraging more action on more fronts, drawing additional activities into the global low-carbon economy.In these circumstances, Australia's best approach is to proceed with a carefully calibrated domestic carbon pollution reduction scheme that balances the costs across different sectors. Australia has successfully carried out this type of reform in the past and I am confident it can do so again. But if the Australian public is to accept such an approach we need a realistic and constructive debate.Australia faces difficult choices. It is not helpful for contributors to public debate to overstate the potential effects of policy options while understating the capacity of the economy to adjust successfully to the necessary changes.
Martin Parkinson is Secretary of the federal Department of Climate Change.

The number of registered participants as at 31 August 2009 was 24,549. Â This number includes more than 13,500 randomly selected Vietnam veterans, Vietnam-era Army personnel who did not deploy to Vietnam, and their respective children.Â  These four categories of participants are the key groups required in sufficient numbers to make the study scientifically robust.The remaining numbers include partners, siblings, nieces, nephews and other family members of Vietnam veterans and Vietnam-era Army personnel who have registered to provide information to the study.The optimum number of volunteers is 5,000 each of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans and 3,000 each of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans' children.Â  The minimum numbers required to ensure valid study conclusions are 3,000 veterans and 1,800 children.The number of Vietnam veterans' children has exceeded the optimum number.Â  The number of veterans in both groups is currently over 4,000.Â  The number of Vietnam-era veterans' children is in excess of the minimum required.Â  Registrations will remain open until at least mid 2010.Work has already commenced on some projects and we can now be confident the overall study can be successfully conducted.</DOC>

Interim arrangements are in place for conducting non-statutory independent merits review of unfavourable refugee status assessments, in the form of a contract between the Commonwealth and a labour hire firm to provide independent reviewers for the immediate caseload.Under the current interim arrangements, the reviews are conducted by independent people well qualified in refugee status determination processes.The role of the Independent reviewer is to consider afresh all claims for protection as they relate to the Refugees Convention. As the independent review process is non-statutory, the role of the Independent reviewer is advisory and not determinative. I draw on the Independent reviewer's assessment when considering whether to exercise my public interest powers under section 46A of the Migration Act 1958
.
 Mr Steve Karas AO, Mr Christopher Keher, and Ms Sue Zelinka.Under the interim arrangements, the remuneration and related conditions of independent reviewers is consistent with the rates set by the Remuneration Tribunal for 'public offices' performing similar work (ie. part time members of the RRT).The current contract in place to provide independent merits review under these interim arrangements was recently extended up to 31 December 2009.Under the interim arrangements, the selection of the independent reviewers was based on the criteria that they were people who had sound experience in administrative decision-making and a background in refugee law.The Government decision to introduce independent merits review of unfavourable refugee status assessments has been announced.Under the interim arrangements, three review assessments have been completed.Taking into account the relatively small number of review assessments and privacy and confidentiality considerations, it is not yet practicable to publish the review assessments.and (m) Independent reviewers are accountable through the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to Parliament. Only the Minister has power under section 46A to allow an offshore entry person to apply for a Protection visa.Assessments may be subject to judicial review in the original jurisdiction of the High Court or in the Federal Court on procedural fairness grounds (but not beyond that).</DOC>

Yes.Yes.The Government is concerned about the arrest and detention of Mr Liu Xiaobo and has called for his release.The Government first raised Mr Liu's detention with the Chinese authorities during the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Canberra on 9-10 February 2009.Â 
 We subsequently followed up with representations through the Australian Embassy in Beijing to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Â 
 The Government 
will continue to make representations to China on the detention of Charter 08 signatories and others who were exercising internationally recognised liberties, including freedom of speech.

A central message in representations to the Burmese regime has consistently been the Government's call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.Â  The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is repeatedly protested by the Government directly to the Burmese regime.Â Yes. The situation in Burma is a foreign policy priority for the Government.Â  It has been, and continues to be, the subject of numerous diplomatic discussions and representations between Australian officials and those of other governments including by Australian Ambassadors, embassy staff, and visiting officials, as well as with members of the diplomatic corps in Canberra.Â  Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, I do not intend to elaborate further as it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments.Yes.Â  The Government, through the Australian Embassy in Rangoon, has made a number of representations on Aung San Suu Kyi's treatment in detention, including pressing the authorities to ensure she has access to medical care and legal advice.Yes.Â  I have raised Aung San Suu Kyi's situation with the ASEAN Secretary-General.Â  I have also discussed Burma with my ASEAN counterparts.Â  Australia's Ambassador to ASEAN meets regularly with representatives from the ASEAN Secretariat and member countries.Â  She discusses a range of issues including relevant human rights matters and the situation in Burma.</DOC>

On 12 May 2009 the Australian Government announced the Debt-to-Health Swap with the Indonesian Government whereby Australia will forgive $75 million of debt and the Indonesian Government will contribute $37.5 million to the Global Fund to support HIV and tuberculosis projects in Indonesia.The Debt-to-Health swap will be implemented in conjunction with AusAID and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). A tripartite agreement between Australia, Indonesia and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria will be signed once agreement has been reached on the swap mechanism. EFIC will then seek to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indonesian Ministry of Finance detailing debt relief arrangements and the conditions that must be met. Resourcing of $75 million allocated as administered equity in the 2009-10 budget will be drawn on and transferred to EFIC once the MoU with Indonesia is finalised.The Australian Government, through its Embassy in Jakarta, has had several contacts with the Indonesian Government on this matter since late 2008. Contacts were made at Deputy Minister level in December 2008, January 2009 and July 2009 and at Director level in June 2009.The Indonesian Government has expressed strong support for the debt swap.</DOC>

Medicare eligibility was provided to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit at Blacktown Hospital on 29 June 2007. The Australian Government did not provide the actual MRI unit to Blacktown Hospital.Under the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations 2008 the MRI unit at the Blacktown Hospital must be available for use at a minimum from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays) for routine services, except for periods reasonably required for necessary maintenance, repairs and upgrades.The unit must also be available for use at all times for emergency services, except for periods reasonably required for necessary maintenance, repairs and upgrades.The Australian Government does not have data on the total number of scans performed which would include scans which did not attract a Medicare rebate.As with the previous answer, the Australian Government does not have data on the total number of scans performed on individual MRI units.Unlike X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, MRI does not use ionising radiation. Medical practitioners determine the most appropriate and clinically relevant diagnostic imaging service for each patient.Under the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations 2008 all Medicare-eligible scans performed on the Blacktown Hospital MRI unit must be bulk - billed.The Government does not have information about MRI scans which do not attract a Medicare rebate. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the cost implications for patients.The Government does not collect this information.The MRI unit at Blacktown Hospital has met both my Department's and my own expectations as we believe it is meeting the requirements set out in the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations 2008 for its Medicare eligibility.</DOC>

For the Gold Coast to be used as a point of entry into Australia from overseas, it would need to be designated as a boarding station for the purposes of section 60 of the Customs Act 1901. Potential boarding stations are assessed on a case by case basis. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) would require the provision of facilities to carry out their regulatory and enforcement functions, such as 24 hour, seven days a week access, security, accommodation and other services. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has separate requirements relating to the management of quarantine risks which much also be met for a point of entry to be designated for quarantine purposes. While the authority to designate boarding stations lies with the Chief Executive Officer of Customs and Border Protection, approval is contingent on all border agencies' requirements being met.Customs and Border Protection and AQIS are not currently considering the establishment of port services based at the Gold Coast. Customs and Border Protection officers based in Brisbane do provide inwards clearance service on the request of owners or agents of arriving vessels at nominated points in the Gold Coast area. This also requires approval from the AQIS. Customs and Border Protection can, and does, provide outward clearance services for overseas departing vessels from the Gold Coast area. This does not require AQIS approval.AQIS is not currently considering the establishment of port services based at the Gold Coast.The Customs Act 1901 section 58 states, 'The master of a ship or the pilot of any aircraft shall not bring his or her ship or aircraft to a place other than a port or airport unless from stress of weather or other reasonable cause'. This section provides for a vessel to arrive at any port 'safe haven' should the need arise due to weather or other emergency situation.Applications can be made under section 20AA of the Quarantine Act 1908 for vessels to arrive at ports other than a 'first port' subject to any specified conditions.</DOC>

Yes. The monies collected under the measure form part of consolidated revenue. A significant portion of this revenue will help support the government's preventative health agenda (see Question 3 below).The Government does not intend to provide funding to the alcohol industry body Drinkwise.The Government is making significant investments to help reduce the incidence of risky drinking, particularly among young and Indigenous Australians. These include:$872 million for the Council of Australian Governments Preventive Health National Partnership Agreement  -  the single largest investment ever by an Australian Government in preventative health;$53.5 million for the National Binge Drinking Strategy announced by the Government in March 2008 comprising:$14.4 million for community-level initiatives to confront the culture of binge drinking, particularly in sporting organisations;$19.1 million for the Early Intervention Pilot Program, to intervene earlier to assist young people and ensure that they assume personal responsibility for their binge drinking; and$20 million for advertising that confronts young people with the costs and consequences of binge drinking;an additional $50 million to tackle binge drinking agreed between the Government, the Australian Greens, and Senator Xenophon comprising:$25 million for a fund to provide sponsorship for sporting and cultural organisations and other community activities, as an alternative to sponsorship from alcohol companies;$20 million for community level initiatives to tackle binge drinking; and$5 million to enhance telephone counselling services and alcohol referrals with an expansion of existing social marketing campaigns;$29.6 million in 2009-10, through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Substance Use Program, to support 119 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander substance use services across Australia;$29.1 million in 2009-10 for drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation services for Indigenous communities, particularly in remote areas, through two Council of Australian Governments measures;in the Northern Territory, an additional $2.6 million in 2009-10 for the continuation of existing alcohol and other drug workforce and services through the 2009 Closing the Gap - Indigenous Health and Related Services measure, and the Expanding Health Service Delivery Initiative; andapproximately $1 million per annum under the Capacity Building in Indigenous Communities Initiative to improve the capacity of Indigenous communities to address problems relating to the misuse of alcohol and other drugs.The Government is considering the recommendations of the National Preventative Health Taskforce in relation to these matters. In addition, the Council of Australian Governments will be considering a report from the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy on options to address binge drinking, which includes key proposals in relation to alcohol advertising.This question should be directed to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education, and Minister for Social Inclusion, the Hon. Julia Gillard MP.</DOC>

Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) records indicate that, Neqtar Australia Pty Ltd, SDS Beverages Pty Ltd and Neqtar Wines Pty Ltd were placed into voluntary liquidation on 24 July 2009. Receivers and managers have previously been appointed to all of the companies on 16 June 2009.It is the role of the liquidators appointed to the companies to investigate the affairs of the companies and to determine what actions might be taken to recover funds for the benefit of unsecured creditors. This necessarily involves an examination of the circumstances leading to the failure of company and an assessment of whether any breaches of duty by persons associated with the company contributed to its failure.External administrators  -  in this case both the liquidators and receivers - are required to report to ASIC any possible breaches of the law by officers and directors of companies to which they have been appointed. On the basis of the external administrator's reports, ASIC will determine what regulatory action, if any, is appropriate. Given their contents, external administrators' reports are not made publicly available. It is also not the practice of ASIC to comment on any current investigations that may be taking place in respect of matters raised in a report.While I have the greatest sympathy for those suffering loss as a result of the failure of these companies - or as a result of any business failure, it is not the role of the Government to provide compensation for commercial losses arising out of business failures.Exposure to counter-party risk is an inherent aspect of commerce in a free market economy. Vendors are primarily responsible for managing that risk; and for making their own arrangement for insuring against that risk, if they wish to do so.Australia has a modern and robust insolvency regime which seeks to minimise the impact of business failure upon shareholders, creditors, employees and other parties who have dealt with failed businesses. There is, of course, only so much that can be done to reduce the losses that members of these groups might suffer when a company is placed into liquidation.Corporate law aims to ensure that companies conduct their businesses honestly and responsibly and meet their commitments to their shareholders and creditors. Company directors are subject to statutory and common law duties in the performance of their functions, including the duty to exercise their powers in good faith, for a proper purpose and in the best interests of the company as a whole. If breaches of those duties result in a person suffering financial loss, the CorporationsÂ ActÂ 2001 provides that those committing the breaches may potentially be liable to pay compensation to those affected.Where a foreign bank has a branch that operates in Australia then, in the event of its failure, section 11F of the Banking Act 1959 provides that the assets of any authorised deposit taking institution in Australia must be made available to meet its liabilities in Australia in priority to all other liabilities of the institution. The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2008 explicitly excludes authorised deposit taking institutions from the operation of the Cross-Border Insolvency Act 2008, thereby preserving the effect of these rules in respect of any actions by a foreign insolvency representative.A foreign authorised deposit taking institution may also be subject to the Large Deposit Guarantee.However, a foreign bank that does not operate in Australia is not subject to Australian prudential regulation. The protections that may exist for the customers of such a bank would depend upon the applicable foreign law.ASIC records indicate that both Neqtar Australia and SDS Beverages are wholly owned subsidiaries of the United Kingdom company Neqtar Ltd. Neqtar Wines is a wholly owned subsidiary of Neqtar Australia. Neqtar Australia, SDS Beverages and Neqtar Wines all had the same directors.The investigation of any other possible legal arrangements between entities associated with the companies in liquidation is the responsibility of the liquidators appointed to the failed companies. Any creditors adversely affected by the collapse of these companies should direct any queries regarding such matters directly to the liquidators. While creditors may have a legitimate interest in otherwise private information obtained through the investigations of a liquidator; such information does not become publicly available merely due to the liquidation of the companies.HWCG Limited and Neqtar Ltd are companies registered in the United Kingdom and the information regarding their status is publically available via search of the UK register, www.companieshouse.gov.uk. A search conducted on 1 September 2009 indicated that HWCGÂ Limited was in Administration but that Neqtar Ltd remained Active.A director of a company may become personally liable for the debts incurred by the company at any time when the company was insolvent and there are reasonable grounds for the director to suspect that the company was insolvent. In addition to becoming liable for debts incurred by the company, a director may become subject to pecuniary penalties and disqualification. The director may, in certain cases, also become liable to criminal prosecution for failing to prevent the company from incurring debts while insolvent.It is primarily the role of a liquidator to determine whether a company has been engaged in insolvent trading. However, in certain circumstances, affected creditors may take direct action. Creditors should contact the liquidator in first instance to discuss the outcomes of any investigations regarding the possibility of insolvent trading having taken place and any proposed actions by the liquidator. If a creditor wishes to initiate their own direct action, they should seek their own legal advice.External administrators are required to refer any possible insolvent trading to ASIC.ASIC administers the Assetless Administration Fund which may, upon application by the liquidator, provide financial assistance to carry out investigations into insolvent trading. Not all administrations are funded. Funding is limited to matters in which ASIC is satisfied there is a genuine possibility of enforcement action arising from an investigation and report.Any dispute between the companies and any other party it has transacted with prior to liquidation is a matter for the liquidators, who have taken over control of the companies and who are obliged to act in the best interests of unsecured creditors. This would include any dispute between the company and its former financiers.</DOC>

No.No.The management arrangements for the North West Slope Trawl Fishery have been assessed against the Australian Government Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries  -  2nd Edition and accredited for the purposes of Part 10 (strategic assessment), Part 13 (protected species provisions) and Part 13A (wildlife export provisions) of the EPBC Act.The nature of demersal trawling means that the potential for significant impacts on benthic environments is generally high. For this reason the Government's assessments under the EPBC Act take into account the number of active operators, level of effort and extent of fishing grounds in determining the likely impact of a fishery on ecosystems, including benthic habitats.Yes.</DOC>

Figures on Overseas Trained Doctors (OTDs) are run at the end of each month. As at 31Â JulyÂ 2009 there were 1404 Specialist OTDs working in Districts of Workforce Shortage (DWS).Permanent entry to Australia for OTDs is available through the General Skilled Migration Program, the Employer Nomination Scheme and the Regional Sponsored Migration Program.For immigration purposes, doctors seeking permanent residency in Australia must hold full medical registration. The following is acceptable as evidence of full registration:full/unconditional/general medical registration;conditional specialist registration which allows the doctor to practice only in their particular speciality, with no other training or supervision requirements.The Government provides funding under the Specialist Training Program (STP) to support overseas trained specialists seeking to achieve fellowship to a specialist college in Australia and support their permanent entry and retention. Since 1 July 2007, the Government has provided funds to support 157 candidates seeking fellowship to a specialist medical college.The 2009 Budget Measure  -  Rural Health Workforce Strategy includes a number of initiatives to better target workforce incentives and retain medical practitioners in communities in greatest need. The Australian Standard Geographical Classification  -  Remoteness Areas (ASGC-RA) forms the basis of the whole rural health 2009-10 Budget measure. Under this measure, rural incentives will target ASGC-RA 2 (Inner Regional) to RA 5 (Very Remote) which will significantly increase the number of eligible rural doctors.Scaling of the 10 year moratoriumOTDs are subject to Medicare provider number restrictions that generally require the doctor to work in a DWS for a 10 year period. From 1 July 2010, the 10 year moratorium period will be scaled so that the greater benefits are targeted to the most remote areas. OTDs will be able to reduce their moratorium period depending on the location in which they choose to practice, from 10 years in ASGC-RA 1 (inner cities) to 5 years in ASGR-RA 5 (very remote).</DOC>

On 26 August 2009 the Australian Government announced transition arrangements for commencement of the proposed changes to the workforce independence criterion in January 2010. These arrangements will assist approximately 4,700 gap year youth, taking the number of young people affected by changes to the workforce participation criterion to around 26,000 in 2010. It should also be noted that many of the remaining 26,000 young people affected by this change will be automatically eligible for Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY as dependants under the changes to the Parental Income Test (PIT).Analysis of Centrelink administrative data based on the home addresses recorded for young people who established their independence under the workforce participation criterion and were granted Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY from the period April 2008 to April 2009 suggests that approximately 77 per cent come from families living in major cities. The remaining 23 per cent are estimated to come from families living outside the major cities. Of the non-metropolitan group, around 18 per cent come from families living in inner regional areas, about 5 per cent come from outer regional areas and less than 1 per cent from remote and very remote areas of Australia. These data take account of the impact of the transitional arrangements announced on 26 August 2009.The table below applies this geographic breakdown to the estimated number of young people in 2010 who will not qualify as independent for Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY under the proposed changes to the workforce participation independence criterion (as indicated above, many will qualify as dependent students instead under the PIT).Region*No. Students^(a) Major Cities of Australia19,900(b) Inner Regional of Australia4,640(c) Outer Regional of Australia1,340(d) and (e) Remote and Very Remote Australia#
 The home address provided by young people on Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY who gained independence through the current workforce participation criterion is classified according to the ABS Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) classification. The ARIA index measures the remoteness of a point based on the physical road distance to the nearest urban centre in each of five size classes - major city, inner regional, outer regional, remote and very remote. When interpreting the geographic breakdown it is necessary to consider that the home address provided by an independent Youth Allowance recipient may not indicate their parents' address in all cases.^ Some numbers are rounded.# Remote and very remote categories are presented together given the low number of people from very remote locations.</DOC>

Retirement of coal-fired power stations is a commercial decision to be undertaken by owners.The impact of the retirement of coal-fired power stations will depend on the timing of the retirement and the general supply/demand conditions existing in the electricity market.The report Powering Australia: The business of electricity supply (Focus Publishing, 2007, page 19) referred to work from the Energy Supply Association of Australia citing the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts.Â  The ABARE forecast was released prior to the announcement of the Government's climate change policies and other factors, such as the current global economic conditions, which would have impacts on the investment environment and demand for electricity.The Australian Government has not adopted a universal nominal indicator on the scale of demonstration projects that is needed to support the commercialisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Â A case by case approach will be taken in assessing the appropriate scale of proposals for industrial scale projects under the Government's $2 billion CCS Flagships program. There will be requirements that projects will be at a size that can be rapidly and effectively escalated to commercial deployment in Australia; and be of a scale that will result in original equipment manufacturers, engineering procurement construction contractors and storage service providers having sufficient confidence in their technologies to offer performance and process guarantees to industry customers for fully-commercial plants.The CCS Flagship program is expected to support at least two and possibly up to four industrial scale CCS projects to be commissioned from 2015.The Australian Government has announced that it will establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy.Â  The details of how ACRE will function will be developed in 2009-10.Questions about the status of the ZeroGen project should be referred to the ZeroGen partners.World aluminium prices averaged US$1360 per tonne in the March quarter of 2009, the lowest since September 2002.Â  Aluminium prices more than halved between September 2008 and February 2009 as the global economic downturn reduced consumption of consumer durables and motor vehicles, which are both significant drivers of aluminium demand.The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) expects there to be no major additions to aluminium smelting capacity in Australia in the medium term given continued low prices and the decline in the global demand for aluminium.ABARE forecasts Australia's aluminium production to decline by around 3 per cent to 1.90 million tonnes and exports to decline by 5 percent to 1.63 million tonnes in 2009-10.As part of the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Australian Treasury modelled a number of greenhouse emission target scenarios to help gauge the impact on emissions intensive trade exposed industries, including aluminium.Â  The results are detailed on page 166 and in Box 6.7 of The Treasury report, Australia's Low Pollution Future: the Economics of Climate Change Mitigation.</DOC>

Where employees in remote areas work even-time rostering arrangements which include annual leave, the Commission should facilitate the retention of these arrangements.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The 2 May 2009 variation further clarified that the intention of award modernisation is that where specific exemptions apply (i.e. relating to the National Employment Standards  -  redundancy), that these are permitted where the Commission considers appropriate. For this reason the Fair Work Bill 2008 was amended to allow a modern award to create an exemption to the redundancy NES.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In a submission to the Commission of 10 October 2008, the Government proposed that the Commission commence a process to determine transitional provisions for modern awards, immediately following publication of stage 2 awards to ensure that parties have sufficient time to become familiar with the content of modern awards and recognising that businesses require certainty regarding their costs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Government also made submissions on 10 October 2008 expressing its concern that all draft priority awards developed by the Commission include a model redundancy clause that provides redundancy entitlements for employees of small business employers. The inclusion of these clauses involves extending this benefit beyond those areas where it is currently provided for in awards and NAPSAs. In this regard, the Government was mindful of the particular needs of small business as it had consulted extensively with small business on the development of its substantive workplace relations reforms. The Government acknowledged that small business can face particular challenges when managing employee engagement and dismissal.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Government supported a case by case approach to the inclusion of redundancy pay entitlements in modern awards. Where this has previously been a common entitlement in a particular industry for small business employees, the Government supported its inclusion in the modern industry award.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In a submission to the Commission of 13 February 2009, the Government encouraged the Commission to make use of transitional provisions in developing final modern awards, noting they may be appropriate in relation to significant remuneration-related entitlements, such as wages, casual loadings or superannuation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Government also encouraged the Commission in its submission of 13 February 2009 to pay careful attention to previous longstanding arrangements and to the requirement of the award modernisation request that the making of a modern award should not increase costs for employers when determining the final shape of ordinary hours for each sector in the Pastoral Industry Award 2010.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Also in the 13 February 2009 submission, with respect to the Contract Cleaning Award 2010 and paragraph 61 of the Commission's Statement of 23 January 2009, the Government advised that it was giving consideration to the issues raised and will advise the Commission of the outcome of these considerations. Paragraph 61 states:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
 '[61] The major parties proposed that the award make provision for an
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
 outgoing contractor to be exempt from making severance payments provided for by the NES under certain circumstances. We are of the view that such a provision would be contrary to the terms of the consolidated request, in particular cl.30, and we have therefore not included it in the exposure draft.'

A number of countries have expressed strong support for the Prime Minister's Asia Pacific community initiative. Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments.The Asia Pacific community will not be modelled on the European Union.Mr Rudd's keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue on 29 May, attended by officials of many countries, outlined the Asia Pacific community initiative and was well received. Countries have expressed their support for the initiative in high level bilateral and multilateral meetings, including the EAS Foreign Ministers' Consultation and the ASEAN-Australia Post Ministerial Conference. Countries have also expressed their support in consultations with Australia's special envoy, Mr Richard Woolcott AO.Mr Richard Woolcott's regional consultations on the Asia Pacific community commenced on September 2008 and concluded in March 2009. The EAS Foreign Ministers' Consultation and ASEAN-Australia Post Ministerial Conference took place in Phuket on 22-23 July 2009.The Government spent around $407,000 on advancing the Asia Pacific community initiative to 11 August 2009. This figure includes travel costs and Mr Richard Woolcott's consultancy fees but does not include indirect costs, such as time spent on the initiative by departmental officers, as they are difficult to quantify.Mr Richard Woolcott's visits to 21 countries focused on the Asia Pacific community concept. Mr Woolcott represented Australia on the UN Security Council in 1985-86 and on several occasions the matter of Australia's bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council was raised in conversation. He offered the reasons why Australia's bid should be supported.No.</DOC>

The Government has responded to the humanitarian issues facing displaced persons in Sri Lanka through the provision of humanitarian assistance and by advocating action by the Sri Lankan Government to protect the welfare of civilians and to promote reconciliation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In 2008-09 Australia provided $24.5 million in humanitarian assistance to meet the critical needs of civilians adversely affected by the conflict (total assistance to Sri Lanka in 2008-09 amounted to $41 million). The humanitarian assistance included food aid, medical supplies, shelter, water and sanitation. It has been delivered through UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and a number of Australian NGOs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  On 14 September 2009, I (Mr Smith) announced a further $5 million contribution to support the resettlement of displaced people. This followed a $1.3 million contribution to NGOs for demining in June 2009 and a further $1 million through the International Organisation for Migration for demining efforts in August 2009. Demining of former conflict areas is a prerequisite for the revival of northern Sri Lanka. This financial year Australia will provide more than $35 million in assistance to Sri Lanka.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Australian Government has made repeated calls during the conflict and since the conclusion of military hostilities in May 2009 for the welfare and protection of civilians to be the absolute priority. The Government has done so directly to the Sri Lankan Government and publicly.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Since the beginning of 2009, I (Mr Smith) have delivered three statements to the House of Representatives on the situation in Sri Lanka. The latest statement, on 14 September 2009, called on the Sri Lankan Government to move quickly to create the conditions for civilians to rebuild their lives, including through voluntary resettlement. The statement noted that reconciliation would require sustained effort by Sri Lanka, its diaspora and the international community to overcome the grief, resentment and anger, and the lack of confidence and trust that was the inevitable consequence of decades of armed conflict. The statement also noted that the time is here for the Sri Lankan Government to win the peace and to forge an enduring political settlement for all Sri Lankans.I (Mr Smith) have spoken to Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister, the Hon Rohitha Bogollagama MP, about the need to ensure the protection of civilians and the need for reconciliation in Sri Lanka on six occasions in 2009, including over the phone and in the margins of multilateral meetings.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In addition, in the margins of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Egypt in July, I (Mr Smith) spoke to Sri Lanka's President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister about the need to ensure the protection of civilians and the need for reconciliation in Sri Lanka.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Australia's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka has raised at a high - level in the Sri Lankan Government Australia's concerns regarding the protection of the internally displaced persons in northern Sri Lanka, their freedom of movement and ultimate resettlement, and other matters of humanitarian and human rights concern, including with:the Minister of Human Rights and Disaster Managementthe Minister for Foreign Affairsthe Secretary of the Presidential Secretariatthe Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairsthe Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rightsthe Senior Adviser to the President and Chair of the Taskforce responsible for the resettlement of internally displaced personsthe Secretary of the Justice Ministry.Senior officials in Canberra have also made representations on these matters to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner on several occasions this year.(3)Â Â  Yes, the Australian Government has regularly raised the issue of access of humanitarian organisations to internally displaced persons' (IDP) camps. With a number of exceptions (in cases where negotiations between the organisation and the Sri Lankan Government are ongoing), the Sri Lankan Government is now allowing humanitarian organisations access to the camps for internally displaced persons.(4)Â Â  DFAT sought information from IMF staff on Sri Lanka's application for an IMF loan through the Department of Treasury and Australia's representatives at the Fund on 14 May and 1 July 2009. Advice was received on 16 May, 2 July and 23 July 2009. On 24 July 2009, the IMF Executive Board approved Sri Lanka's request for a stand-by arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 1.65 billion (around $US2.6 billion) to support the country's economic reform program. The decision was supported by the IMF Executive Director representing the constituency of countries of which Australia is a member.</DOC>

I have received and replied to Mr Price's letter of 1 June 2009 concerning Medicare eligibility for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit at Mr Druitt Hospital, but I have not received a request concerning the provision of an actual MRI unit. While the Government manages Medicare eligibility of MRI units, individual hospitals and other diagnostic imaging providers are responsible for the acquisition and operation of actual units.The Government is not in a position to assess under-utilisation of MRI units such as the one at Blacktown Hospital. The Government does not have details of all scans performed on this MRI unit, nor whether there are significant waiting times, etc.The Government appreciates that patients across Australia value access to affordable and convenient MRI services. The Government's objective is to improve health outcomes within a sustainable budget. As noted in (1), while the Government manages Medicare eligibility of MRI units, individual hospitals and other diagnostic imaging providers are responsible for the acquisition and operation of actual units.</DOC>

Since 24 November 2007 the Australian Government has provided assistance under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program (MTOP) to one (1) patient to travel overseas for assessment for, and if suitable to undergo, a small bowel transplant.As at 13 August 2009 the Commonwealth Government has expended $1,381,993.01 in relation to costs for the assessment of this patient prior to transplant.and (b) This information is not available to the Commonwealth Government, however I anticipate costs would be significant because of the level of training required to establish a transplant team, maintain relevant skills and the associated equipment costs.and (b) I am unable to provide this information as the Commonwealth Government has not costed the set up and annual running costs of a small bowel transplant facility.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Australia and New Zealand Organ Donation Registry (ANZODR) which is the authoritative source of data for organ donation and transplantation activity has advised that data on bowel transplantation waiting lists are not collected as this procedure has not yet been undertaken in Australia and there are no formal/reported waiting lists.The number of patients suitable for bowel transplantation in the wider region who may utilise an Australian facility is not known.</DOC>

Reliable data are not available to answer the honourable member's question.A person may become eligible for income support for a range of reasons, including loss or reduction of full-time, part-time or seasonal employment; as a result of a change in their personal circumstances, such as obtaining residency; or through meeting income and asset testing thresholds.Information on when recipients of Newstart Allowance, Parenting Payment or Youth Allowance were last in employment may be recorded in text on Centrelink's system where it is relevant to their payment (such as periods relating to paid leave entitlements or a redundancy payment); however, information on when an income support recipient was last in employment is not a reportable data item in the Centrelink system. Therefore, these data cannot be extracted to reliably assess the average duration of unemployment since the last full-time job for such recipients.Disability Support Pension falls within the responsibilities of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.</DOC>

This is because not all job seekers who find a job inform their provider or Centrelink.

Job seekers being serviced under Job Services Australia have an ongoing Mutual Obligation to participate in activities and look for work, in exchange for their income support. Under Job Services Australia, most job seekers who continue in employment services after 12 months will also have a requirement to undertake a Work Experience activity for every twelve months they remain unemployed. Significantly, job seekers can now start a Work Experience activity at any time, if their Job Services Australia provider agrees it is the most appropriate activity to assist a job seeker achieve their employment goals, so they don't need to wait 12 months to access these services.During the transition to Job Services Australia, job seekers who were already undertaking an activity, such as Work for the Dole, to meet their six-month Mutual Obligation activity requirement (under Job Network), were supported to continue in those activities. This enabled job seekers to see projects through to completion. Time spent on these activities by job seekers who transitioned immediately into the Work Experience Phase under Job Services Australia was recognised and counted toward their first Work Experience Activity Requirement.As at 1 July 2009The total number of job seekers participating in Work Experience activities to meet their Activity Test or participation requirements under Job Services Australia as at 1 July 2009, was 26 343, including 329 job seekers in activities commenced on the first day of Job Services Australia.The number of job seekers participating in Work Experience activities by activity type as at 1 July 2009 was:Activity TypeNumber of JobseekersAccredited Education and Training (Vocational)261Non-accredited Training (Vocational)2Other5Other Approved Programs1Other Non-vocational1Part Time/Casual Paid Employment48Training in Job Search Techniques1Voluntary Work in community/non profit sector10Subtotal (new activities under JSA)329Job seekers participating in activities commenced prior to 1 July under the previous employment services to meet their six monthly Mutual Obligation requirement (including Work for the Dole, Voluntary Work, Defence Force Reserve, education and training, part-time work, relocation or any combination of these activities).26 014Total26 343Â Note::A job seeker can undertake multiple placements i.e. that is a job seeker can undertake more than one activity type at the same time.(b)Â Â  As at 1 August 2009The total number of job seekers participating in Work Experience activities as at 1 August 2009, was 26 363, including 9708 job seekers in activities commenced under Job Services Australia.The number of job seekers participating in Work Experience activities by activity type as at 1 August 2009 was:Activity TypeNumber of JobseekersAccredited Education and Training (Vocational)6 111Addictions Intervention (Non-vocational)9Brokered Unpaid Work Experience29Cultural Services (Non-vocational)6Defence Force Reserves4Drought Force20Drought Force 60+26Interpersonal Skills (Non-vocational)2Medical/Health Related Services (Non-vocational)3Mental Health Interventions (Non-vocational)33Non-accredited Training (Vocational)72Other286Other Approved Programs224Other Non-vocational43Part Time/Casual Paid Employment1 965Skills Training (Non-vocational)76Training in Job Search Techniques117Voluntary Work in community/non profit sector281Work for the Dole401Subtotal (new activities under JSA)9 708#

Green Corps under Job Services Australia has been improved and expanded which will limit its comparison to the previous program. Under Job Services Australia:Participation in Green Corps activities is available to job seekers of all ages receiving income support payments.Green Corps activities have been significantly expanded from current arrangements with no limits on places available. Job Services Australia Providers are able to vary the length of activities, with flexible start and end dates, allowing activities to be better targeted to community needs. There is no longer a restriction on projects in urban areas.To 12 August 2009, there were 36 job seekers in Green Corps activities under Job Services Australia. There were also 528 job seekers completing Green Corps activities under the previous Employment Services Contract of 2006-2009. Under Job Services Australia, Green Corps is one of a number of options available to job seekers undertaking Work Experience activities. There is no forecasting for Work Experience activities such as Green Corps as access to all activities is demand driven dependant upon the needs of individual job seekers.Of the 36 job seekers in Green Corps activities, under Job Services Australia to 12 August 2009, the age breakdown was as follows:no job seekers were under 20 years of age11 job seekers were under 30 years of age13 job seekers were aged between 30 and 44 years of age, and12 job seekers were aged 45 years or over.</DOC>

As at 12 August 2009, there were (a) 132 176 enrolments*, (b) 110 770 commencements**, and (c) 55 383 completions. This data cannot be disaggregated by payment type.*Under the PPP 'enrolments' are participants that have applied, met the programs eligibility criteria and were expected to commence training within six weeks of their approval.** 'Commencements' are recorded when an approved training organisation has commenced delivery of formal training to the eligible participant for an eligible qualification  -  this milestone triggers the first of two PPP payments  -  the other being the completion milestone.As at 12 August 2009, 40 193 job seekers that were referred by an Employment Service Provider (ESP) had completed a PPP qualification and (a) 5 859 of these achieved an 'employment outcome'. The distribution of 'employment outcomes' across payment type is described in Table 1.No data exists on (b) average employment outcomes.As the states and territories are delivering job seeker places progressively through 2009, performance data is not yet available. Reports demonstrating progress against output targets are due 31 January 2010.

As at 12 August 2009, (a) 48.5 per cent of trainees from Phase 1 had achieved an employment outcome after the completion of their PPP qualification, (b) 30.1 per cent of trainees from Phase 2 had achieved an employment outcome after the completion of their PPP qualification, and (c) 7.1 per cent of trainees from Phase 3 had achieved an employment outcome after the completion of their PPP qualification.Employment outcomes are only recorded for trainees that were referred by an employment services provider.The reason why the percentage of employment outcome is significantly higher for Phase 1 as compared to the other phases is that trainees have had more time to achieve an employment outcome. Numbers of trainees that have achieved an employment outcome in Phases 1, 2 and 3 is at Table 2.No data has been provided in respect to a participants 'previous employment status' as all PPP participants are recorded as job seekers.Table 2: Trainees that have achieved an employment outcome as a percentage of completions for Phases 1, 2 and 3.

The Australian Government has administered funding appropriated for the following financial years: $27 875 000 in 2007 - 2008; $336 327 000 in 2008 - 2009; $487 252 000 in 2009 - 2010; $523 413 000 in 2010 - 2011; and $646 003 000 in 2011 - 2012.All states except the Government of Victoria are signatories to the National Partnership Agreement on the Productivity Places Program(NP PPP). Under the NP PPP the Australian Government provides 100 per cent of the funding for job seeker places and 50Â per cent of funding for existing worker places. States have committed to provide 40 per cent of the funding for existing worker places and put in place arrangements to ensure a collection of a minimum 10 per cent private contribution for existing worker places.The NP PPP will be in place from 2009 to 30 June 2012 covering financial years 2008 - 2009 through to 2011 - 2012.

Note: Data as at 14 August 2009 is not readily available. The closest readily available data for each question has been used in the answers below.The Compact with Young Australians includes a National Youth Participation Requirement under which young people will be required to complete Year 10 and then undertake full-time education, training, employment, or a combination of these until the age of 17.Â To support the Compact, young people aged under 21 seeking Youth Allowance who do not have Year 12 or equivalent (known as Early School Leavers), will be assessed against new participation requirements.At 14 September 2009, there were approximately 6100 recipients of Youth Allowance (other) who were granted payment on or after 1Â JulyÂ 2009, who did not have Year 12 or equivalent qualifications and were subject to the new participation requirements.As at 31 July 2009, the average duration on income support for Youth Allowance (other) recipients was 70 weeks.As at 31 July 2009, 31 per cent of Youth Allowance (other) recipients exited income support within 3 months of grant.As at 31 July 2009, 75 per cent of Youth Allowance (other) recipients exited income support within 12 months of grant.Number of 13 week employment outcomes and number of education outcomes for Youth Allowance (other) recipients for each quarter from March 2006.Employment outcome payments are made to employment service providers when a job seeker is placed and remains in employment or gains employment for 13 weeks.Â  A second payment is made if the job seeker remains in employment for a further 13 weeks (referred to as a 26 week outcome).Â  Education outcome payments are made when job seekers complete one or two semesters of an eligible education/training course. The table below shows the number of 13 week employment outcomes and the number of education outcomes.QuarterNumber of 13 week employment outcomes for YA (o) recipientsNumber of education outcomes for YA (o) recipientsTotal of 13 week employment outcomes and education outcomes for YA(o) recipientsMarch 20064 288Â  324 320June 20064 4912974 788September 20064 5712484 819December 20065 2021935 395March 20074 225Â  344 259June 20074 3054244 729September 20074 4322974 729December 20074 9331195 052March 20083 531Â  223 553June 20083 7693484 117September 20083 5402093 749December 20083 8471483 995March 20092 528Â  202 548June 20092 2021222 324It is not possible to accurately provide the percentage of Youth Allowance (other) recipients who attained an education or employment outcome for each quarter from March 2006. This is because the outcome data is cumulatively calculated for each quarter, whereas the Youth Allowance (other) population is 'point in time' and may have fluctuated over the same quarter reference period.Under the Compact with Young Australians:a National Youth Participation Requirement will apply under which young people will be required to complete Year 10 and then undertake full-time education, training, employment, or a combination of these until the age of 17;state and territory governments have guaranteed young people aged 15 to 24 years access to an education or training entitlement; andparticipation requirements will be strengthened for Youth Allowance and children attracting Family Tax Benefit Part A for their parents.The elements of the Compact are expected to contribute to strengthened participation levels in education and training, resulting in the achievement of the 90Â perÂ cent national YearÂ 12 or equivalent attainment rate target by 2015 (which was brought forward from 2020 under the Compact).(7)Â Â  (a)Â Â  There are no estimated employment outcomes under the Compact with Young Australians. The intention of the education and training entitlement is to enable young people - especially those vulnerable to the tightened labour market effect of the global recession - to be better prepared and qualified for a transition into the workforce particularly as the economy recovers.Â (b)Â Â  The Government estimates that the education and training entitlement under the Compact with Young Australians will result in up to 135,000 young people being encouraged to return to education and training or undertake further education and training to improve their skills and current qualifications.The Government expects that most early school leavers who take up a Compact place will seek VET training. Early modelling work undertaken by the Department suggested that up to 14,000 young people may take up a school place as a result of the Compact.(8)Â Â  See response to 7(a).(9)Â Â  See response to 7(a).(10) The States and Territories are responsible for the implementation of the Compact with Young Australians. Clause 58 (b) of the National Partnership Agreement on Youth Attainment and Transitions states that within the COAG framework, the Commonwealth, the States and Territories will develop an information exchange protocol between Centrelink and education and training authorities to assist with monitoring and implementation of the Compact's National Youth Participation Requirement.Clause 58 (i) states that the development of a formative evaluation of initiatives covered by the Agreement will be undertaken to support further policy development and continuous improvement. This evaluation has not yet been developed but will be done so in collaboration with the States and Territories, once their respective Implementation Plans and reform areas have been agreed by the end of November 2009.Clause 40 states the education and training entitlement will be reviewed in April 2011 by COAG Senior Officials who will report to COAG on the effectiveness of the education and training entitlement and make recommendations to COAG on whether the entitlement should be extended past 31 December 2011. The specific parameters surrounding the effectiveness of the entitlement have not yet been determined by COAG Senior Officials, but the economic conditions at the time will be considered.The National Partnership Agreement does not specify whether the reviews conducted will be made publicly available.</DOC>

Most states and territories (states) are in early stages of implementation of the existing worker element of the Productivity Places Program (PPP). The number of commencements is expected to rise from September to December with over 57,000 commencements anticipated to occur by 31 December 2009. Reports from seven states indicate that as of 1 August 2009 arrangements have been put in place for the delivery of over 30,000 places to existing workers.Preliminary data from five states indicates that over 12,000 existing workers have commenced training under the Productivity Places Program to 1 August 2009. This includes an estimated 1,250 commencements for existing workers through a series of national enterprise trials and 11,475 commencements for existing workers under state delivery arrangements. This figure is an underestimate as it excludes data for 2009 for Queensland and Western Australia as data on commencements have yet to be provided by these two states. This figure excludes existing workers at risk of retrenchment who have received training under the structural adjustment component of the job seeker element of the PPP (approximately 7,000 workers). Data on completions are not yet available for all states.The data also exclude additional training effort in Victoria during 2009. Victoria is not a signatory to the National Partnership Agreement on the PPP (NP PPP). Victoria has negotiated a separate arrangement with the Commonwealth Government. This arrangement will see PPP funding incorporated into Victoria's existing arrangements to support its reform process Securing Jobs for Your Future  -  Skills for Victoria. As part of this agreement the two governments agreed that a separate Productivity Places Program (PPP) will not operate in Victoria and ongoing PPP funding will instead be incorporated into existing skills funding arrangements on certain conditions, including that Victoria report on overall growth in delivery and higher level qualifications to both job seekers and existing workers.The table below shows preliminary data by qualification level on how many existing workers have commenced training through the PPP under state delivery arrangements. Data on existing workers participating in the national enterprise trials have not been collected at state level as projects were brokered by Industry Skills Councils at the national level and not individual jurisdictions. Data on additional training effort in during 2009 in Victoria, Queensland Western Australia are not included. A breakdown of unpublished data by state and territory should be obtained directly from each state government.

Qualitative data on progress has been collected but the qualitative information that would enable this question to be answered has not yet been collected. It is anticipated that qualitative information will be collected as part of the mid-term review of the funding and operational arrangements of the National Partnership Agreement which is due to occur no later than 30 June 2010.Over $74 million has been notionally provided by the Australian Government as of 13 August 2009 to support training for existing workers under the Productivity Places Program  -  $17 million through MoUs with all states, $3 million through national enterprise trials and $54 million as a notional payment under the National Partnership Agreement with seven states. In addition a further $15 million has been provided to the Victorian Government to support additional training for existing workers through existing skilling arrangements taking the total Australian Government contribution to date to over $89 million.The table below shows, by state, the Australian Government's notional contribution as of 18 August 2009 for state delivery of the PPP to existing workers under MoU arrangements and the National Partnership Agreement on the PPP. It also shows the funding contribution that the Australian Government has committed to provide each state for the full 2009 calendar year. These payments are notional only as under the new federal financial framework there are centralised payment arrangements and states do not receive a separate payment for existing workers and job seekers. This notional split of the payments does not reflect how the funds are transferred between governments.A state by state breakdown of funding provided under national enterprise trials is not available as funding was directed to projects brokered by Industry Skills Councils rather than into individual jurisdictions.

States are required to ensure that:Additional training is made available for job seekers and existing workers.Additional training is targeted in accordance with the agreed national qualification profile level.Additional training is targeted at industries, occupations and qualifications in skills shortage.The conditions of agreement, including the following are met:training funded under the Agreement is in addition in existing effort;enterprises and industry representatives are engaged in the program to identify skills needs and facilitate the delivery of training;there is a role for national Industry Skills Councils in the brokerage of training;there is a role for Employment Service Providers in the brokerage of training;a contestable environment for the delivery of training in which public and private providers can compete;40 per cent of funding for existing worker places is provided by state governments; anda minimum 10 per cent enterprise/individual contribution for existing worker places is collected in aggregate over the life of the Agreement.State progress will be measured through data and reporting arrangements as set out in (7).(9)Â Â  Under the terms and conditions of the NP PPP states are required to meet a calendar year target for the delivery of training to existing workers and contribute funding to support this commitment. Data to enable an assessment of the performance of states against 2009 targets will not be available until 31 January 2010. Preliminary data indicates that as result of the present economic climate there is a high demand for training at lower qualification levels and the demand for job seeker places exceeds supply.</DOC>

The National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2008, Regulation 16, requires that each approved rental dwelling, and the management of it, complies at all times with the landlord, tenancy, building and health and safety laws of the State or Territory and local government area in which the dwelling is located.As part of the application process, while applicants are not required to provide evidence that their proposals are compliant with local planning or building codes, or obtained planning approval, they are required to sign a declaration which states that they will be fully compliant. This allows for applicants to forward plan and to include projects that will deliver dwellings over the four years of NRAS 2008-2012. A reserved allocation of incentives may be offered without this evidence, however, no incentive will be provided, either as a payment or refundable tax offset, until the dwelling meets all requirements of the Scheme, including Regulation 16 above, and is available for rent.As mentioned above, dwellings must comply with the landlord, tenancy, building and health and safety laws of the relevant state or territory. An incentive would not be provided where the Department was aware that this requirement had not been met.All applicants are required to sign a declaration indicating that they will be fully compliant with the National Mandatory Requirements for NRAS, one of which is that 'dwellings will comply with State, Territory and Local Government planning and building codes and requirements'. In addition, applicants are also required to indicate the status of their projects (eg. land acquired, design stage, planning approval received, construction commenced/completed). While evidence to support these claims is not required as part of the application process, where there is some doubt during the assessment process about the claims being made, this information has been requested.For those applications which have been approved, incentives are issued in arrears following an annual reporting period.Â  Approved participants must indicate that they have complied with local regulations and provide a copy of the certificate of occupancy or equivalent for each dwelling.Reserved allocations may be offered to applicants prior to obtaining planning approval. Gaining approval under the Scheme may be a critical part of proceeding with the project and applicants may need or wish to secure this prior to applying for planning approval. Approval under the Scheme may be a way for applicants to secure finance to commence the development. Relevant laws must be complied with and no incentive will be provided, either through payment or refundable tax offset, until the dwelling has met the requirements of the Scheme.The Department has not made any representations for, and does not advocate on behalf of, applicants seeking planning approval or variations to building requirements. Planning approval would be made at the discretion of the relevant local council in line with their usual practices and with reference to their requirements and town plans.</DOC>

to (5) Under the Australian Constitution states and territories have primary responsibility for local government and their reform. The Australian Government is assisting in this process with the $25 million Local Government Reform Fund announced by the Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, at the June 2009 meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government. We are also establishing the Centre for Excellence for Local Government to enhance professionalism and showcase innovation and best practice in the local government sector.</DOC>

As part of the application process, each state and territory education authority was required to conduct a competitive process seeking applications from secondary schools within their sector.Funding for Science and Language Centres (SLC) under the Building the Education Revolution program was allocated on the basis of demonstrated disadvantage, demonstrated need for the specified building and the capacity to complete construction within the 2009 - 10 financial year. A National Assessment Panel of experts assessed the applications submitted to my Department on the strength of the information provided in response to each of the criteria.The National Assessment Panel provided me with a list of the projects deemed suitable in accordance with the assessment criteria and a recommendation for their funding for my consideration.
The National Assessment Panel found that Caritas College's case for disadvantage was not clearly demonstrated and rated a lower score than other applications from schools across Australia. Subsequently, the College was not recommended as suitable for SLC funding.

All funding for the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program has now been allocated and finalised. Under the BER Guidelines, funding is based on a school's full-time student enrolment (FTE). As Stewart House and Royal Far West Schools do not have a permanently enrolled student population, they are not eligible for BER funding. The FTE associated with the students that attend either Stewart House School or Royal Far West School has been used to calculate the notional BER funding of their home school.This is a matter for the NSW Government.In recognition of the valuable work carried out by these schools, on 12 August 2009 Minister Gillard wrote to the Hon Verity Firth MP, New South Wales Minister for Education and Training in support of Stewart House and Royal Far West Schools. It is understood that the NSW Government is currently modelling funding options for specialist schools, such as Stewart House School, that do not meet the funding eligibility requirements of the BER.</DOC>

Funding for Centrelink Customer Service Centres in the northern Gold Coast region (Biggera Waters, Nerang and Southport) is not appropriated to individual offices. As customers in this region use one or more of these offices regularly, resource management in the region is managed centrally to ensure maximum flexibility to meet fluctuating demand. Funds were not appropriated to the Southport office for the 2008-09 financial year. Customers in the northern Gold Coast region attend the office that is most convenient to their work, study, employer provider and/or home.As noted in question 1, funding for 2009-10 and the Southport office is not fixed. Funding for future financial years, including 2009-10 and over forward estimate years will be subject to customer demand and changes to service delivery. Funding will continue to be allocated to the Northern Gold Coast cluster of offices to ensure that the Biggera Waters, Southport and Nerang offices are able to respond effectively to changing customer demographics and demands.On 7 September 2009, 37 employees worked at Southport Customer Service Centre, of whom 29 were employed on a full time basis. The total budgeted funding for salaries and wages for staff for the 2009-10 financial year cannot be provided specific to Southport, as noted above.Centrelink is unable to answer this question completely as it does not currently capture the total number of customers who attend a Customer Service Centre. Centrelink is able to advise that there were approximately 382,000 instances where customers reported income or were recorded at a reception point in Southport in 2008-09. Of these, 87,345 were instances of customers reporting income at Southport and 294,065 were recorded reception contacts. Data on reception contacts does not include situations where a customer's record was not accessed and may not include situations where the customer was seen by a Customer Liaison Officer prior to reaching a reception point.</DOC>

The Medicare Family Assistance Office at Pacific Fair, Broadbeach, Queensland was established on 12 February 1998. The funding for this office is included at an aggregate level across Medicare Australia's programs and is not appropriated separately.A budget was allocated to each Medicare Australia office in the 2008 - 09 financial year. The estimated expenditure for Pacific Fair was $1,137,760.The expected expenditure for the Pacific Fair Medicare office in 2009 - 10 is $1,135,624.Medicare Australia is not anticipating any significant changes to the operations of the Pacific Fair Medicare office over the forward estimates period. Medicare Australia does not therefore expect any significant change to the cost profile for this office.As at 7 September 2009, 11 fulltime and one part time staff were employed at the Pacific Fair Medicare office (a further three fulltime staff and one part time staff were on maternity leave). An amount of $816,190 is budgeted for salaries and wages of staff in 2009 - 10.Between 1 July, 2008 and 30 June 2009, 176,665 customers received services in this office.

Parliament appropriates funding to the Department for overall delivery of outcomes-not to specific locations. The Department then allocates this revenue to various offices, having regard to expected workload at that office. In the 2008-09 financial year, the Department's Southport office spent $2,511,120 on staff salary and administrative expenses (infrastructure and overhead costs such as Information Technology and property are funded centrally).For the 2009-10 financial year, the Department's Southport office has been allocated $2,817,000 for staff salary and related administrative costs. This may need to be adjusted through the course of the year to reflect adjustments to activity levels or potential movement in casework within the Department's service delivery network.Allocations beyond 2009-10 have not yet been determined for the Department's Southport office.As at 7 September 2009, the Department's Southport office employed 33 staff, of which 24 staff were employed on a full time basis.

In November 2006, the Argentine court investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) centre in Buenos Aires issued an arrest warrant for Mr Vahidi in relation to his alleged involvement in the bombing.</DOC>

I commend the work of UNICEF, with which Australia works closely and which does vitally important work in Sri Lanka and around the world.The matter of Mr Elder's visa is one for the Sri Lankan Government, Mr Elder and the United Nations to resolve. Mr Elder and UN officials have indicated to Australian officials that representations by Australia to the Sri Lankan Government regarding the visa were not required. In numerous representations to Sri Lankan government ministers and officials, Australia has made clear its view that international organisations should be given the access and information they need to help meet the needs of displaced persons. Australia has also made clear its strong support for freedom of expression in Sri Lanka, and its view that freedom of expression will be important in encouraging reconciliation between communities and providing non-violent avenues for Sri Lankans to express their grievances.</DOC>

Membership of the Asia-Europe Meeting will advance Australia's national interests. It will strengthen Australia's ties with two regions of great importance to Australia's prosperity and security. It will allow Australia to make a contribution to efforts to promote dialogue and cooperation between Europe and Asia.The Asia-Europe Meeting comprises 43 countries from Asia and Europe, along with the European Commission and ASEAN. It fosters cooperation on a range of issues of importance to Australia. For example, the dialogue encourages effective regional and global approaches to international problems such as the global economic crisis, climate change and realisation of the Millennium Development Goals.Australia attempted to join ASEM in 1996 and 1998, without success. However, at the last meeting of ASEM Foreign Ministers in Hanoi (25-26 May, 2009), ASEM welcomed our membership and participation at the Brussels Summit (4-5 October, 2010). This was a collective recognition by the countries of ASEM of the strong contribution Australia can and will make to the ASEM process.Australia's participation in the Asia Europe Meeting process demonstrates the Government's commitment to working regionally and multilaterally to address economic, political and security challenges. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to the strongest possible relations with our Asian neighbours and it complements our engagement in other regional groupings such as the East Asia Summit and APEC. It reflects also our now strong and modern partnership with Europe.No.During the course of pre-planned travel, I (Mr Smith) raised Australia's interest in joining ASEM with relevant counterparts. A Deputy Secretary from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade undertook two overseas trips to promote Australia's interest in joining ASEM. The first was to Cambodia and India from 4-8 January, 2009. The total cost for this travel was $11, 909.76. The second was to Singapore, Vietnam and Jakarta from 11-16 May. The total cost for this travel was $8,657.87. My department managed the daily running of the campaign from within existing resources.</DOC>

Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Asia Pacific community will not be modelled on the European Union.The Government spent around $409,000 on advancing the Asia Pacific community initiative to 14 September 2009. This figure includes travel costs and Mr Richard Woolcott's consultancy fees but does not include indirect costs, such as time spent on the initiative by departmental officers, as they are difficult to quantify.</DOC>

Funding for Centrelink Customer Service Centres in the northern Gold Coast region (Biggera Waters, Nerang and Southport) is not appropriated to individual offices. As customers in this region use one or more of these offices regularly, resource management in the region is managed centrally to ensure maximum flexibility to meet fluctuating demand. Funds were not appropriated specifically to the Nerang office for the 2008-09 financial year and can not be disaggregated. Customers in the northern Gold Coast region attend the office most convenient to their work, study, employer provider and/or home.As noted in question 1, funding for 2009-10 and the future financial years, specific funding for Nerang is not fixed. Funding for future years, including 2009-10 and over forward estimate years, will be subject to customer demand and changes to service delivery. Funding will continue to be allocated to the northern Gold Coast cluster of offices, as a whole, to ensure that the Biggera Waters, Southport and Nerang Customer Service Offices are able to respond effectively to changing customer demographics and demands.On 7 September 2009, 31 employees worked at Nerang Customer Service Centre, of whom 22 were employed on a full time basis. The total budgeted funding for salaries and wages for staff for the 2009-10 financial year cannot be provided specific to Nerang, as noted above.Centrelink is unable to answer this question completely as it does not currently capture the total number of customers who attend a Customer Service Centre. Centrelink is able to advise that there were approximately 192,000 instances where customers reported income or were recorded at a reception point in Nerang in 2008-09. Of these, 66,999 were instances of customers reporting income at Nerang and 124,979 were recorded reception contacts. Data on reception contacts does not include situations where a customer's record was not accessed and may not include situations where the customer was seen by a Customer Liaison Officer prior to reaching a reception point.</DOC>

I have been advised that the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group has decided to terminate its proposal to become the majority shareholder of Lynas Corporation. Questions regarding foreign investment applications should be directed to the Treasurer.Treasury consults with my Department as part of its consultations with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies on foreign investment proposals. These consultations are to identify any potential national interest issues arising from foreign investment proposals allowing Treasury to provide whole of government advice to the Treasurer.The Government is aware that the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group has investments in Burma.The assessment of potential foreign investments, including from foreign government entities, involves consideration of any matters that are relevant to Australia's national interest, which can include corporate conduct and business standards.The Government has clearly stated that it welcomes foreign investment across all sectors, so long as it is not contrary to Australia's national interest. Australia's foreign investment regime is non-discriminatory and Chinese investors are treated the same way as other investors.</DOC>

Four reforms in the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy (NP) are directly relevant to reducing business costs and compliance burdens in the building and construction sector, including the housing sector. These are:development assessment, to deliver improved development assessment processes to provide greater certainty and efficiency in the development and construction sector;a National Construction Code, to enable a nationally-consistent approach to on-site building and plumbing regulation;a national electronic conveyancing system, to deliver a single electronic system for completing real property transactions and lodging land title dealings for registration in Australia; andlicences of tradespeople, to establish a national trade licensing system.The NP provides up to $550 million in Commonwealth funding to States and Territories over five years in order to facilitate and reward the delivery of 27 priority deregulation reforms. Available funding has not been allocated to the completion of individual reforms.All jurisdictions were required to provide their first progress report under the NP to the COAG Reform Council (the Council) by 30 September 2009.A decision is yet to be made on whether the Council's report will be made public.The Council has yet to complete its report to the Prime Minister in relation to progress against milestones as set out in the NP implementation plan.</DOC>

The project is to build a 154MW heliostat concentrator photovoltaic (HCPV) power station project in Victoria in three stages. The first stage involves the construction of a repeatable HCPV unit at Bridgewater with a 2 MW pre-production prototype to be constructed at Mildura; stage 2 involves the construction of a further 100MW at Mildura; and stage 3 involves the addition of a final 52MW at the Mildura site.On 7 September 2009, Solar Systems Pty Ltd placed itself into voluntary administration by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). PwC is assessing Solar Systems' financial situation and is seeking a buyer for the business. The Administrators have until 7 December 2009 to put forward recommendations to the creditors on the business going forward.The first part of stage one, the development of a repeatable HCPV unit at Bridgewater has commenced. Stages two and three have not commenced.The current status of government grants is:The previous Government committed $75 million under the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (LETDF) to Solar Systems Pty Ltd to construct stage two, the 100MW stage at Mildura. LETDF funding is strictly tied to achievement of project milestones, none of which have yet been met; therefore no money has been paid.The previous Government also committed $4.5 million under the Asia Pacific Partnerships Program (APP) for stage one. Of this, $2.62 million has been paid through the APP following the successful completion of project milestones for stage one.The Victorian Government also committed $50 million under its Energy Technology Innovation Strategy Large Scale Demonstration Program to the project. Of this, $0.375 million has been paid by the Victorian Government following the successful completion of project milestones for stage one.It is too early to make an assessment about the future of the Mildura Project at this stage and the Administrator must be given time to explore all options regarding Solar Systems.</DOC>

The Australian Government had no involvement in the granting by the Northern Territory Government of the exploration licence over the Angela-Pamela deposits.Any proposal to mine the Angela-Pamela deposits will need to be referred to me under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) if it is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. Following referral, if I determined a proposal to be a controlled action under the EPBC Act, it would then be subject to a rigorous environmental assessment process. This would include public consultation. I would take into account the outcomes of the assessment process and issues raised in public submissions in deciding whether or not to approve the proposal.A proposal to mine would also require approval from the Northern Territory Government.</DOC>

My Department has used information from its third Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA 3) to respond to this question. The LSIA 3 collected information from former international students on two occasions: in August 2005, six months after their permanent visa was granted, and then again in August 2006, 18 months after their transition to permanent residency.In August 2005, six months after the grant of permanent residency, 85 per cent of former international students were working, their participation rate was 93 per cent and their unemployment rate was 8 per cent. The national unemployment rate at this time was 4.9 per cent.Twelve months later, in August 2006, 92 per cent of former international students were working, their participation rate was 95 per cent and their unemployment rate had fallen to 3 per cent. The national unemployment rate at this time was 4.7 per cent.It is noted that former international students have more favourable labour market outcomes (with the exception of their initial unemployment rate) than the general Australian population. This may be due to their relatively younger median age and the two year waiting period which applies before they are entitled to social security benefits.My Department has established an ongoing survey for monitoring migrant outcomes (including former international students), the Continuous Survey of Australia's Migrants. The first wave of this survey is underway, with results expected in early 2010.</DOC>

Yes.No. This statement is incorrect.2008 - 09 was a transition year for Caring for our Country. In this first year a wide range of projects were funded under the national priorities to ensure continuity of natural resource management activity that was consistent with the high-level program objectives while the more detailed program architecture was being developed. Investments funded during the transition year included open grants, community coastcare, regional projects and election commitments. These transition year projects have since been analysed to establish their contribution to the specific outcomes and targets which were developed later and which sit beneath the national priorities. This mapping of investments to targets will facilitate consistent reporting on expenditure and progress each year.Final data on the actual success rate for proposals developed under the 2009-10 Caring for our Country business plan will not be available until I have announced all successful proposals. I am confident the success rate will be greater than 10%.The Government is committed to continuous improvement, and to this end the business plan and application process has been extensively reviewed and redesigned, taking into account stakeholder feedback. Revised targets, an on-line application form and clear supporting instructions and information are being developed for 2010 - 11.Â  Both achievements and implementation will be reviewed each year and any necessary adjustments made.All proponents who are funded under the 2009-10 Caring for our Country business plan declared in their applications that they took full responsibility for ensuring the necessary planning, approvals, permits and permissions were in place before commencing their projects. Non-compliance with this requirement would constitute a breach under the funding agreement. My department is not aware of any such breaches having occurred.</DOC>

I am advised by the department that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's (AFMA) management of the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) is consistent with government policies and environmental and ecological sustainability objectives. AFMA temporarily closed a part of the existing fishery until 13 October 2009 to prevent trawling by Commonwealth vessels adding additional fishing pressure to fish stocks targeted by WA trap and line fishers. AFMA extended this closure on 8 October 2009 until 31 December 2010 on the basis of continuing concerns over additional fishing pressure. Whilst the closure is in place AFMA will negotiate catch sharing arrangements with WA.In addition, AFMA has proposed new boundaries for the NWSTF to ensure consistency with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangements between the Commonwealth and Western Australian (WA) governments. The original intention of the OCS agreement was that the NWSTF takes place in waters seaward of the 200 metre depth contour. The boundaries of the fishery were gazetted in 1995. However, with improved mapping precision it has been discovered that the gazetted boundary does not track the 200 metre depth contour in a number of places. AFMA is therefore seeking to amend the boundary as described in the OCS agreement. This proposal is consistent with government policy agreed in an exchange of letters between the then Western Australian Fisheries Minister and the then Commonwealth Fisheries Minister in September 2007. Implementation of this proposed change will result in a net reduction in the area open to trawling and restrict overlap of State and Commonwealth fishing activities on tropical snapper stocks.I am advised by the department that the proposed trawl boundary amendments within the OCS are consistent with AFMA environmental and ecological sustainability policies. The fishery is managed by AFMA in accordance with Commonwealth Government policies, including the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy policy and Commonwealth Bycatch policy. An ecological risk assessment has also been completed for the fishery. The NWSTF is also assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) in accordance with the Australian Government Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries. The fishery is declared an approved Wildlife Trade Operation under the EPBC Act.I am advised by the department that the fishery boundary line is under review in order to more accurately reflect the Offshore Constitutional Settlement arrangements as described at answer 865, 1(a). When implemented, the new boundary will result in a net reduction in the area open to trawling. Management measures described at answer 865, 1(b) ensure that the new fishery boundaries will not have a significant impact on the marine ecological environment.See response at answer 865, 2 in relation to the NWSTF. I am unable to comment on the environmental impact from fishing in the adjacent WA-managed Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery.The proposed boundary change will result in a small increase in the area available to trawling in the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery, consistent with the intent of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement arrangements. No adverse effects from trawling have been detected in this large but lightly fished fishery to date. I am advised that AFMA will continue to manage the fishery in accordance with Commonwealth Government policies, including the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy policy and Commonwealth Bycatch policy. I am advised that AFMA will also put in place precautionary management measures to address any risks to the environment. I am advised that AFMA will liaise with the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and the Western Australian Department of Fisheries in developing any new management arrangements resulting from the proposed boundary change.I support the repositioning of fishery boundaries to align trawl boundaries with water depths as intended in the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangement and to restrict potential overlapping fishing activities.Previously answered in response to question 865, 1, 2 and 3. I am advised that AFMA will take the issues covered in (i), (ii) and (iii) into account in implementing management arrangements for the fishery. (iv) The purpose of the proposed repositioning of the trawl boundaries is to accurately reflect the intent of the OCS arrangement. I am advised that the access of WA fishers is unchanged, and they may continue to fish with non-trawl methods beyond 200 metre depths within the boundaries of the Commonwealth trawl fisheries.State and Commonwealth fisheries are separated by a boundary representing the 200m depth contour for trawling only, regardless of ocean floor type. The Commonwealth manages waters seaward of the 200 metre depth contour for trawling only, WA manages other fisheries from the coast out to the edge of the Australian Fishing Zone. AFMA has extended the closure in the NWSTF until 31 December 2010 while catch sharing arrangements are negotiated with WA. This closure will prevent trawling by Commonwealth vessels adding additional fishing pressure to fish stocks targeted by WA trap and line fishers.</DOC>

No additional areas have been opened to trawling. A temporary closure implemented in 2007 in the North West Slope Trawl Fishery has been extended by AFMA until 31 December 2010. Catch sharing arrangements will be developed with WA and a proposed amendment to the Offshore Constitutional Settlement would permanently remove this area from the Commonwealth trawl fishery.I have answered this question.

No. This is a matter for Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).No. This is a matter for AFMA.See response at 865 1b.AFMA advises that both fisheries have had Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) undertaken by CSIRO. Two ERAs assessed the effects of fishing upon target, by-product and threatened, endangered and protected (TEP) species and direct and indirect impacts of trawling on habitats and communities.</DOC>

The Government's position is that Israel needs to freeze all settlement activity.Â  This is one of Israel's obligations under the Roadmap for Middle East peace.Â  The Government believes it is important that the parties, with the support of the international community, honour the agreements they have entered into as part of the Roadmap.Â  This means the Palestinians must also honour their agreements, including continuing to dismantle terrorist infrastructure and to halt violence and incitement.The Government's position on settlements is guided by Australia's strong support for Israel's ongoing security, the Middle East peace process and a two-state solution, and the striving for a just and enduring peace.The Government position on settlements has been stated publicly and in discussions with the parties to the peace process.</DOC>

Australia has listed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist entity under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 for the purposes of Australian anti-terrorism financing measures pursuant to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001).Â  The LTTE is listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of Sri Lanka, India, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The LTTE is also listed by the European Union for the purposes of its anti-terrorism financing measures.Â The Australian Government has not proscribed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation under the Commonwealth Criminal Code.Â  The issue of terrorist groups and whether or not they should be proscribed is under constant review by Australia's security and intelligence agencies.Â  Consistent with longstanding practice, it would be inappropriate to comment on the status of any consideration being given to the listing of this or any other organisation under the Commonwealth Criminal Code.Before listing an organisation the Attorney-General must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act or advocates the doing of a terrorist act.Â  The legislation does not require that a terrorist organisation presents a direct threat to Australia's security interests before it can be listed.Â  The Attorney-General takes advice from the Australian intelligence and security agencies prior to listing an organisation.For an organisation to be listed, a majority of states and territories must not object to the listing.Â  As part of the standard process, the Attorney-General writes to the Premier and Chief Ministers of each state and territory to seek their agreement to the listing and provides them with a copy of the Statement of Reasons.Â  However, the decision to proceed or not proceed with the listing of an organisation remains the decision of the Attorney-General.The issue of terrorist groups and whether or not they should be proscribed is under constant review by Australia's security and intelligence agencies.Â  Consistent with longstanding practice, it would not be appropriate to comment on specific details of intelligence assessments.As indicated in answer to (2), it would be inappropriate to comment on the status of any consideration being given to this listing and whether any advice or recommendation has been provided by security or intelligence agencies.</DOC>

In 2009-10, $3.8 billion of assistance to developing countries will be provided under Australia's aid program and the Government has committed to increase the aid Budget further to 0.5% of gross national income by 2015-16. The objective of this funding is to assist developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia's national interest. The Australian Government is committed to the MDGs  -  which requires action on a number of fronts - and has brought them to the centre of Australia's aid program. This includes strong support to promote economic growth which is the most powerful long-term solution to poverty when translated into development that is accessible by all, fair and environmentally sustainable. Further, in 2009-10 the Government will be increasing its support to the key MDG areas of education, health, gender and environment.In relation to MDG 5, improving maternal health, the Government continues to make substantial commitments. It is estimated that in 2009-10, $595 million will be expended on health under Australia's aid program, an increase of 35% from 2008-09. Much of this funding will aim to enhance the performance of health systems which remains at the heart of improving maternal health. More specifically, at last year's High Level Event on the MDGs in New York, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd committed Australia to spend $250Â million over four years (2008-2011) to improve women's and children's health, with a focus on Asia-Pacific countries where maternal and child deaths remain high. This includes $42.5 to the United Nations Population Fund, the lead UN agency on MDG 5. Countries receiving the $250 million and providing programs include Indonesia, Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines and Nepal. This is on top of substantial funds provided for health in countries such as in Papua New Guinea. The Government is also providing $93.6 million over four years (2008-2011) to the United Nations Children's Fund and $64 million over four years (2009-2012) to the World Health Organization, both of which have a strong focus on maternal and child health. I recently announced further commitments of $250 million over 20 years to the expanded International Finance Facility for Immunisation, and $26 million (2010-2015) to Nepal to help the world's poorest countries deliver better health programs to their people. These commitments also aim to improve healthcare for women and children through strengthened health systems.The objective of the Australian aid program is to assist developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia's national interest. Central to this is helping developing countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Progress against the MDGs requires action across a number of fronts, including fair and sustainable economic growth. As such the Government does not earmark a percentage of aid program funds to a specific budget line for MDGs or population initiatives. Rather, the aid program as a whole contributes either directly or indirectly to meeting the MDGs and achieving sustainable population goals.The Government has committed significantly increased resources to two of the sectors most directly relevant to the MDGs, namely health and education. In 2009-10, $595 million will be committed for health initiatives representing around 16 per cent of the total aid program. Allocations support basic health care and infrastructure; governance and sector wide activities; medical services; education and training; infectious disease control including sexually transmitted infection and HIV, and reproductive health care. An example of work funded under health, is funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which supports key work on population dynamics, including growth rates, age structure, fertility and mortality, all central to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development.In 2009-10, education expenditure is estimated to be more than $690 million, approximately 18% of the total aid program. Increased engagement in the sector over the next few years will see education become the flagship of the Australian Government's aid program. Australia's education assistance is comprehensive, supporting national education plans and extending from basic through to tertiary education and skills training. It focuses on assisting countries to achieve universal primary education (MDG2) and ensuring girl's attendance. Hence this focus on education particularly girls, is also central to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development including sustainable population growth.</DOC>

The unfair contract terms provisions in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009 apply to consumer contracts in a standard form between a business and a consumer for a supply of goods or services or a sale or grant of an interest in land where the acquisition of the goods, services or interest is wholly or predominantly for personal, domestic or household use of consumption. The provisions exclude certain shipping contracts and contracts representing the constitution of a company, managed investment scheme or other kind of body. The unfair contract terms provisions would apply to particular body corporate management contracts to the extent that such contracts meet these criteria.</DOC>

As at 18 August 2009:3,025 Home Sustainability Assessments have been completed.No interest free Green Loans had been provided as of 18 August 2009. The Green Loans Program commenced on 1 July 2009 and participating households first had to have a Home Sustainability Assessment conducted before applying for a Green Loan. Now that households have begun receiving their assessment reports, partnering financial institutions will begin receiving applications for loans from householders.The Green Loans funding of $175 million will support up to 360,000 Home Sustainability Assessments and up to 75,000 Green Loans.No interest free Green Loans had been provided as of 18 August 2009.The Home Sustainability Assessments are derived from an Assessment Calculator developed by the Centre for Design atthe Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. The Home Sustainability Assessment report identifies estimated greenhouse gas emissions savings and estimated energy and water cost savings associated with the various energy and water efficiency measures recommended as a result of the assessment.Home Sustainability Assessments are undertaken by Assessors who have:Completed specific training (the Professional Household Assessment Course) and a police check;been accredited through the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors:obtained the appropriate insurances: andentered into a contract with the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.This information is not available.</DOC>

No. As announced in the 2009-10 Budget, the Government is amending the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fees for cataract surgery, which is now able to be performed more quickly and safely due to improvements in technology.Medicare is a universal scheme offering equality of access to all Australians, with the same level of rebate regardless of location. It is a matter for individual ophthalmologists to determine where they choose to provide their services.In recognition of the costs associated with providing specialist services in rural and remote Australia, assistance is provided to improve access to eye services through the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program (MSOAP) which complements any specialist outreach services provided by state and Northern Territory governments to improve the access to medical specialist services. MSOAP funds are accessed by ophthalmologists providing outreach to the Grey Electorate.Additionally, many ophthalmologists travelling to rural and remote areas receive further financial assistance from the state and territory governments which covers travel and accommodation costs, and loss of earnings at the practitioner's normal practice location.I recognise and commend the efforts of those dedicated ophthalmologists who provide a range of services, including cataract surgery, in rural and remote communities, where those services would otherwise not be available. It is noted that the majority of services are performed in the capital city and 9% of services are performed in rural and remote areas of South Australia.In reference to the potential impact on state-funded patient assistance transport schemes and metropolitan hospitals, it is not possible to predict the impact as we cannot predict the charging and practice behaviour of doctors.The amendments to the cataract surgery items were announced as part of a budget measure. Such measures are regarded as 'Budget-In-Confidence'.</DOC>

The Government does not comment on certain aspects of submarine availability for security reasons. However, the Navy continues to meet operational requirements.Three submarines are presently crewed and in various stages of their operating and maintenance cycles.The remaining three are in or awaiting longer term maintenance cycles.The Government has, for security reasons, a long standing policy of not commenting on the operational aspects or detailed capabilities of the Navy's Submarine Force. Submarine availability and maintenance are carefully managed to ensure operational availability.Due to security concerns, Defence does not comment on the specifics of submarine operational availability.The force structure of six submarines is designed to allow submarines to undergo maintenance; this is known as force rotation. In a 12 month period, all submarines will undergo maintenance for varying lengths of time.The minimum number of personnel required to safely take a Collins Class submarine to sea is 35, however this number does not enable sustained operations.The three crewed Collins Class submarines are sufficiently manned with 155 qualified submariners.</DOC>

In relation to those parts of the question that request information on the cost of my overseas travel and that of my personal staff, please refer to the report Parliamentarians' travel costs paid for by the Department of Finance and Deregulation (DoFD), which is tabled biannually giving details of dates, purpose of travel, countries of destination and costs of visits. The response to questions (5) and (6) covers those costs incurred by the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio.I attended the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in order to meet with a range of my Foreign Ministerial counterparts to discuss Australia's multilateral and foreign policy priorities and important global challenges, such as disarmament, food security, the global recession and climate change. The Non-Aligned Movement includes almost two-thirds of the members of the United Nations and over half of the world's population. Its Summit is the largest regular gathering of world leaders outside of the United Nations General Assembly.Six staff and officials attended the NAM Leaders summit with me. Although they did not attend the summit, another thirteen staff and officials were in Sharm El-Sheikh to provide support for my attendance at the summit. Of the thirteen, seven were from the Australian Embassy in Cairo, including five locally-engaged staff.Two staff members from the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled with me to Malta.Two staff members from the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled with me to Hungary.While in Sharm El-Sheikh I stayed at the Grand Rotana Resort and Spa. Accompanying staff and officials stayed in the Grand Rotana Resort and Spa, and the Coral Beach Rotana Resort.While in Malta, the accompanying staff and I stayed at the High Commissioner's residence.No hotel accommodation was required in Budapest as I transited only.The total cost to the portfolio associated with the attendance of all staff and officials at this summit was $117,765.00.The total cost to the portfolio associated with the trip, including my travel to Malta and Hungary, was $120,017.39.While on this trip I met formally or informally with the following people to discuss issues of mutual interest.

Yes as at 15 September 2009 $7.382 billion had been invested in RMBS.As at 15 September 2009, the amount invested in securities of issuers that are authorised deposit-taking institutions was $3.929 billion and the amount invested in securities of issuers that are non-authorised deposit-taking institutions was $3.453 billion.Yes.No, as far as the AOFM is aware all loans associated with its RMBS securities met the minimum requirements as at the time of issuance.Yes, all RMBS invested in have met the minimum requirements that apply at the time that the RMBS are issued. Importantly, all AOFM RMBS investments remain rated AAA. While the majority of the securities are expected to continue to meet AOFM minimum eligibility criteria, certain minimum requirements applicable at the time of issue may not be maintained. The key example of this is the requirement at the time the security is issued that a payment on any loan subject to the security must not be more than 30 days in arrears. Whereas this requirement is imposed at the issue date, loans subject to the security may go into arrears for more than 30 days at any subsequent date.No. The minimum requirements apply at the time that the RMBS are issued, and while the majority of the securities are expected to continue to meet AOFM minimum eligibility criteria, certain minimum requirements applicable at the time of issue may not be maintained. The key example of this is the requirement at the time the security is issued that a payment on any loan subject to the security must not be more than 30 days in arrears. Whereas this requirement is imposed at the issue date, loans subject to the security may go into arrears for more than 30 days at any subsequent date.On the 11 October 2009, I announced that an extension to the Government's investment in Australian RMBS to further support competition in Australia's mortgage market. The Government will direct the AOFM to provide up to a further $8 billion of support to new issuances of high - quality RMBS, depending on market conditions. This investment will provide a major boost to smaller lenders and promote competition in the mortgage market, helping to put downward pressure on borrowing rates over time. The RMBS market continues to be affected by the fallout from the global financial crisis so this temporary extension will help smaller lenders to continue to issue RMBS in the short term as the market recovers.The initiative has enabled 13 smaller mortgage lenders to raise an average of around $838 million each to fund new mortgage loans. As at 29 October 2009, the private sector had purchased $3.4 billion of the AOFM sponsored deals, or about 31 per cent of the funds raised through the program. The private sector has predominantly bought short-term securities, but in some recent transactions have purchased long-term securities. The AOFM has purchased about $7.5 billion and is expected to deploy the remaining funds by the end of October or early November 2009.This funding has enabled these lenders to maintain competitive interest rates, higher lending volumes and higher market shares than would otherwise be the case, and may have prevented some smaller lenders from withdrawing from mortgage lending. The initiative has maintained the operational infrastructure of the RMBS market, which will help to facilitate a faster recovery once conditions in financial markets normalise.There is more competition that would otherwise have been the case.</DOC>

All states and territories were delivering Productivity Places Program (PPP) places to existing workers under a Memorandum of Understanding during 2008 and 2009. This was a bridging arrangement to allow delivery from August 2008 and prior to the finalisation of the National Partnership Agreement on the Productivity Places Program.State and territory deliver of mainstream PPP places for both existing workers and job seekers have come on line progressively through 2009. States and territories have been set a calendar year target for delivery under the PPP. Within this calendar year period states and territories have the flexibility to determine the timing of the delivery of training. This flexibility enables states and territories to adjust the timing of delivery to match anticipated peaks and troughs in the pattern of local demand.The table below identifies the month in which the first payment was made to states and territories under the National Partnership Agreement on the Productivity Places Program thereby providing the capacity to deliver training to existing workers and job seekers. The trigger for payment was an implementation plan that was agreed between the Commonwealth and the state or territory. Implementation plans outline how the conditions of the National Partnership Agreement on the Productivity Places Program will be met.Â JurisdictionMonth of first paymentNSWMay 2009QLDApril 2009WAMay 2009SAApril 2009TASApril 2009ACTJuly 2009NTMay 2009Since the commencement of the PPPpreliminary data indicates that over 19 000 existing workers have commenced training under the PPP to 30 June 2009.

Treasury does not separately model the employment impacts of the individual measures. This would require complex modelling of all of the sectoral linkages. Spending in one sector does not affect that sector in isolation; it ripplesthrough the economy through a complex set of micro relationships that makes it difficult to reliably estimate the employment effects of any specific measure.Treasury have indicated in the 2009/10 budget papers that the $42 billion stimulus package is expected to support up to 210,000 jobs.</DOC>

The removal of the items reflects the Government's commitment to simplifying and enhancing Medicare billing practices, and promoting appropriate clinical practice.The removal of items 50124 and 50125 were announced in the 2009-10 Federal Budget. Such measures are regarded as 'Budget-In-Confidence' during development and until announced.Any practitioner that is currently administering joint injections may continue to perform the service under the relevant MBS attendance item for their particular medical specialty. There are many services carried out during an attendance with a doctor that do not attract a separately identified benefit.The joint injections will be performed as part of the standard consultation which will be eligible for a Medicare rebate. For example, General Practitioners (GPs) when performing the procedure would bill under a Level B consultation (item 23, schedule fee of $34.30) or a Level C consultation (item 36, schedule fee of $65.20). In addition, GPs are currently eligible for additional payments when they bulk bill Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 years of age. These payments are currently $5.70 in metropolitan areas and $8.55 in rural areas, Tasmania, and eligible metropolitan areas. A specialist or consultant physician would claim under the relevant attendance items, items 104/105 (schedule fee of $80.85/$40.60) or items 110/116 (schedule fee of $142.65/$71.35).In addition to the Medicare rebate for the consultation, all Australians including pensioners and health care cardholders will continue to have access to the extended Medicare safety net and the medical expenses tax offset.I do not have information on the affordability of bulk billing clinics providing these treatments.I do not have information about the out-of-pocket expenses of providers.</DOC>

The Department does not record the number of interviews conducted by officers in the course of processing Student visa applications.The Department does not record the number of face-to-face interviews conducted in the course of processing Student visa applications. Face-to-face interviews, however, are conducted regularly across the caseload. Interviews are also conducted by phone, depending on the client's location in relation to the issuing post.The Department does not specify the type of fraud in recording a fraudulent outcome on a visa application. In 2007-08 and 2008-09, 2273 and 3847 instances of fraud were respectively recorded in DIAC systems for Student visa applicants.The majority of fraud which is identified in the Student visa caseload relates to financial documentation provided in support of the applicant's claims to have the financial capacity to support themselves in Australia. This includes loan documentation, bank deposits, income tax returns and overdraft statements.The Department has a range of measures to check the authenticity of documents provided by Student visa applicants. These include contacting the relevant document issuing authorities, including educational and financial institutions, various government authorities and employers to verify a document's authenticity.All Student visa applicants must provide proof of identity and are subject to security, character and health checks.Student visa applications are processed according to levels of immigration risk. Each country by education sector is assigned an immigration risk level, known as an AL. These levels range from AL1 (low risk) to AL5 (extreme risk) and are calculated on the basis of objective data on the immigration compliance of Student visa holders in Australia.Assessment Levels allow the Department to align Student visa requirements and integrity checking with the calculated immigration risk associated with Students from each country across education sectors. The higher the AL, the more stringent the documentation requirements and levels of checking for Student visa grant.The Department regularly reviews the AL for each country and each education sector and changes are made where objective data indicates a change in immigration compliance. A list of current Student visa ALs can be found on the Department's website and is attached (Attachment A).While Assessment Levels form a broad framework for levels of integrity checking, the Department continually monitors the student visa caseload and, as a result of information obtained, may impose additional integrity measures on existing or emerging markets where it is warranted. As an example, in addition to ALs, the Department maintains more than 60 profiles for the student program that guide decision-makers on handling risk. These, and other measures, are part of the Government's ongoing response to any changes in risk within the student visa program and build on the Department's continual effort to combat fraud as it emerges.The Department makes visa cancellation decisions for breaches of Student visa conditions and other reasons under specified powers within the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) (for example, under sections 109, 116, 128 and 137J). Section 109 and section 116(1)(d) of the Act provide a specific power to cancel a visa where a holder has given the Department a bogus document (as defined in section 97 of the Act) in support of their visa application. Section 109 also allows for the cancellation of a current visa based on provision of a bogus document in relation to any previous visa held.In 2008-09, 55 Student visas were cancelled due to the provision of bogus documents in an initial or previous visa application. Some cancellations under other powers may have involved fraud of some type, but this level of detail is not recorded in departmental systems.There were over 302,000 student visa applications lodged in 2007-08. Of these over 84,000 (27.9 per cent) recorded the involvement of an agent, including over 55,000 where the agent was located offshore.There were over 360,000 Student visa applications lodged in 2008-09. Of these over 113,000 (31.2 per cent) recorded the involvement of an agent, including over 59,000 where the agent was located offshore.Please note that the data does not record agents used by clients who submit paper applications offshore and are recorded through the Department's Immigration Records Information System (IRIS). For this reason, the number of applications that would involve an agent would be higher than the figures recorded.During the period between 1 July 2008 and 9 September 2009, no agents have been charged under the Migration Act 1958 for lodging false or fraudulent information or documentation. The Department takes administrative action where there is evidence of agent collusion in detected fraud, which can include referring an agent for a possible breach of conduct to the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, formally warning an agent, or suspending access to lodge visa applications online.In line with the Commonwealth prosecution guidelines, cases would only proceed to possible prosecution where there is evidence of significant fraud or repeat offences.

The most recent available information on vocational education and training (VET) in general relate to 2008, and it is anticipated that 2009 calendar year statistics will be released in July next year. In 2008 there were 1 696 400 VET students, who had 12 950 900 subject enrolments. These 1.7 million VET students represented 11.7 per cent of the estimated resident population aged 15 to 64 years at 30 June 2008, according to ABS preliminary population estimates released on 11 August 2008.The most recent available information on school students' participation in vocational education and training as part of their Senior School Certificate studies relates to 2007. Since the publication of the VET in Schools data was taken over by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER), the delay in publishing these data has been considerably reduced. NCVER released the 2006 VET in Schools data on 16 June this year, followed by the 2007 release on 16 September. At this stage, NCVER anticipates release of the 2008 VET in Schools data in the first half of 2010.In 2007, there were 15 000 school-based apprentices and trainees, representing 3.3 per cent of school students enrolled in Years 11 and 12 at August 2007, according to the latest ABS schools statistics bulletin.A breakdown of this information by state, is set out in the table below:N.S.W.Vic.QldS.A.W.A.Tas.N.T.A.C.T.AustraliaVocational education and training students, publicly funded - 2008 ('000)547.6547.6547.6547.6547.6547.6547.6547.6547.6Publicly funded VET students as percentages of Estimated Resident Population aged 15 - 64 years11.713.610.011.710.014.214.210.011.7School-based apprentices and trainees - 2007 ('000)1.76.25.00.60.90.20.10.415.0School-based apprentices and trainees (percentage of all Year 11 - 12 students)1.35.45.21.51.81.82.04.33.3Sources: NCVER Students and Courses 2008; ABS Population by Age and Sex, Regions of Australia, 2008 (Cat.

The PBAC considers applications from companies for PBS-listing having regard to the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (value-for-money) of medicines for specific treatment purposes, in comparison with other available treatments.When a product is approved for listing on the PBS, certain restrictions or conditions may apply as recommended by the PBAC. A medicine may be considered for restricted benefit or authority-required PBS listing for a number of reasons: for example, to limit PBS usage to the medical uses, patient groups (such as Indigenous populations) or settings deemed appropriate in terms of clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness.In 2005 the Department of Health and Ageing convened an expert advisory panel  -  the Expert Advisory Panel on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicines  -  to assist with improving the capacity of the PBS to meet the particular health needs of Indigenous Australians. The Panel identified a number of medicines which have the potential to make a significant positive impact on the health of Indigenous Australians. These medicines (all of which are listed in the above table) were considered by the PBAC, with advice from the Panel, to be clinically beneficial and cost-effective only when restricted to this population.</DOC>

There is no evidence that the deregulation of the Australian wheat industry has threatened the viability of Australian wheat growers. In fact, partial deregulation has opened up opportunities for growers who are now able to determine the nature and timing of marketing arrangements best suited to their requirements.Under the new wheat marketing arrangements there are now 27 companies accredited to export bulk shipments of wheat, increasing the competition amongst buyers for the purchase of wheat from Australian farmers. In the first year of operation, 17 accredited entities exported more than 12 million tonnes of bulk wheat to 42 countries. Australian wheat is now being exported to more than double the number of countries that AWB exported to (17 countries) in its final year.Farm gate prices for Australian wheat are largely determined by international commodity markets. This was also the case under the previous single desk arrangements applying to bulk wheat exports. Growers have the same opportunities to spread risk by a combination of on-farm storage, partial sale for cash and partial sale to the pools. Partial deregulation of the wheat export market has resulted in the development of a greater range of risk management products tailored to the needs of individual farmers.Risk management was a focus of the 15 grower information sessions held across NSW in 2008 to coincide with the introduction of the new wheat marketing arrangements.Â  These were organised by the Australian Government in collaboration with the NSW Farmers Association. Information was provided on pool sales, cash contracts, hedging, basis, currency, futures, options, swaps and combinations of these tools. Feedback on the value of these sessions from participants was very positive.</DOC>

Baseline performance indicators for the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) have been agreed as set out in Section 16 of the Agreement.Indicator specifications for these indicators have been developed by the Housing and Homelessness Information Management Group and endorsed by the Housing Ministers' Advisory Committee. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare submitted the specifications to the COAG Reform Council (CRC).Data for the majority of the housing indicators are being sourced from ABS surveys, such as the Survey of Income and Housing (SIH), the National Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS), with supplementary program data. Homelessness data uses Counting the Homeless report Census and SAAP data.The baseline report will use the latest available data (2007-08), except for the proportion of homeless Australians, which will use the latest Census data (2006) and will be provided to the CRC in December 2009. It is anticipated that the report will be published by the CRC in the first half of 2010.It was acknowledged in the development of the NAHA that the two indicators for housing supply and efficiency would need to be developed. The indicators are being developed in consultation with the National Housing Supply Council for discussion and consideration by the CRC.No forward targets have been established. Activity and change over time is measured against the agreed indicators.</DOC>

On current planning, Defence may acquire the first JSF in 2014 and commence initial training and operational testing to achieve Initial Operational Capability by 2017 while Full Operational Capability is expected to be achieved around 2025.Sinclair Knight Merz has prepared a draft Public Environment Report for Defence which provides an assessment of the potential environmental impacts from the JSF introduction. As the JSF will be initially based at RAAF Base Williamtown, the Draft Report and an associated program of community consultations which commenced on 6 October 2009, is focussed primarily on the Port Stephens and Newcastle communities. The Public Environment Report process will help Defence provide the Environment Minister with enough information to make an informed decision about assessment and approval processes for the JSF introduction under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act Cwlth 1999. Defence anticipates a formal environmental referral to the Environment Minister by mid 2010 and will then most likely be directed to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement process.Please see table below.

A flight movement is normally defined as the arrival or departure of an aircraft from an airfield.Â  Additionally, for aircraft conducting 'touch and goes' at an airfield, each circuit flown is counted as an individual flight movement.Â  For Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAAWR), however, a flight movement is defined as the flight of a single aircraft conducting a single weapons delivery pass on a target at SAAWR as part of a training mission involving from one to four aircraft.Please refer to table below.

Â However, strafing activity is planned to be conducted at SAAWR. The F-35 uses a thrustÂ that is considered to be approximately 67 per centÂ of the maximum thrust available to the F-35 during these manoeuvres.Yes. Noise impact on Salt Ash residents from current F/A-18 operations was included in the draft Public Environment Report commissioned by Defence on the potential environmental impact from the introduction of the F-35 JSF Sections 6.4.1.2 to 6.4.3.3 of the Public Environment Report, which is available on www.nextairgeneration.com.au , refers to this information.Weapons are armed inside the Designated Danger Area. The Designated Danger Area has a Gazetted boundary to ensure that all weapon releases fall within the range, including ricochets.Between 11,000 feet and 500 feet.No material, fired, released or ricocheted travels beyond the gazetted SAAWR boundary.Yes. The duty of care ensures that aircraft operations are conducted in a safe manner, with appropriately qualified crews undertaking flying tasks. The safety and integrity of aircraft and their associated weapon systems is ensured through a rigorous airworthiness program, which includes annual audits of technical and operational airworthiness compliance. On the ground at SAAWR, a team of safety personnel, which includes a qualified range safety officer, ensure the range is clear of any obstructions which may inhibit safe aircraft operations, and also that the range is clear of any personnel or equipment (military or civilian) which may be inside the gazetted range boundary. The SAAWR is bounded by a fence and appropriate signs to warn members of the public of the dangers of incursions. Warning flags are hoisted at boundary entry points and gates as a further visual signal that weapon training is underway. A telephone is located at the entry point to the range, connecting to the range safety officer, for all visitors to seek clearance to enter the range. If required, personnel are positioned as range sentries to ensure no trespassing onto the range during range practices. These sentries have direct radio communication to the range safety officer who will call a halt to aircraft operations should a conflict arise. Pilot competency is assured through a thorough and rigorous training regime with suitably experienced and qualified instructors to undertake the training. Further, in the actual conduct of flying operations at SAAWR each formation of aircraft will have at least one experienced pilot (normally the flight leader of the formation) whose responsibility is to ensure all aircraft are flying the correct patterns and are undertaking weapons training in a safe manner. If required, the flight leader will call a halt to operations if he is not satisfied with any aspect of the training.</DOC>

and (b) The fuel used by the F/A-18 Hornet is Jet Propellant 8 (JP-8), also known by the NATO code F-34. When introduced, the Australian F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) plans to operate using this fuel.Within Australia, JP-8 is base commercial jet Fuel (Jet A-1 ) with additives. JP-8 is a Kerosene type turbine fuel that contains:Hydrocarbons greater than 99 per cent;Static dissipator additive also known as the commercial product (Octel Stadis 450);Corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver;Fuel system icing inhibitor - diethylene glycol monomethyl ether;Antioxidant; andMetal Deactivator  -  N, N-disalicylidene 1,2-propane diamine. However, this is very rarely added.Information regarding the health effects of JP-8 is available at the following website (http://ohsc.defence.gov.au/msds/).(2)Â Â  On average approximately 6,000 litres.(3)Â Â  A specific measure of unburnt fuel or ash can not be determinedÂ due to theÂ wide variety ofÂ conditions a Hornet operates in and its flight profile.(4)Â Â  Unburnt fuels contain hydrocarbons, aromatics and polyaromatics hydrocarbons (PAH)Â that have varying degrees of toxicity, and additives such asÂ antioxidants, fuel system icing inhibitor, lubricity improvers,Â metal deactivators and staticÂ dissipaters. Toxicity levels are set in the initial product Material Safety Data Sheet. Fuels are always changing and as a result the levels of certain compounds may decrease (especially with respect to sulfur based species due to refining processes) and hence their relative toxicity may be affected. The Material Safety Data Sheet for JP-8 can be accessed using the following link http://www.chevronglobalaviation.com/docs/jp8.doc(5)Â Â  The fuel usage for both the F/A-18A/B and F-35 JSF varies according to operational factors, such as configuration and internal fuel carried. The JSF is still in the early stages of flight testing so final fuel flow figures are yet to be verified.(6)Â Â  The New Air Combat Capability Public Environment Report was listed for public access on 6 October 2009 at the website http://www.nextairgeneration.com.au. Issues regarding unburnt and jettisoned fuel are discussed within that document. This document also references a 2002 study into the potential impacts of aircraft exhaust emissions and fuel deposition in proximity to RAAF Base Williamtown and Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. The 2002 study found no evidence of detectable contamination of rainwater tanks or collecting surfaces (typically roofs).</DOC>
