 - If I can start with the second part of the question: I cannot give that guarantee. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that I cannot give that guarantee. It is not possible for anybody in my position to give an absolute guarantee. I can only express the hope that there are no others. Also, I express my confidence in the arrangements that we have put in place, which do not involve an inquiry in precisely the terms requested by the Leader of the Opposition, but the inquiry will be conducted by somebody who is very experienced. I think it is fair to say that Mick Palmer enjoyed the confidence of both sides of politics in the roles that he carried out in the Australian Federal Police. He has ample terms of reference. The results of the inquiry will be made public. I can only repeat what I said on Sunday - that this is a very sad and regrettable situation - but until the full circumstances are known I do not want to say anything further.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. Not all members of the House know that she was an observer of the elections, based in Amman in Jordan. I got a note from her today saying that it was a great experience. Of course, the elections in Iraq on 30 January were an enormous event. The government congratulates the simply extraordinary courage and also the very great determination of the Iraqi people to go out and vote in the face of enormous intimidation from insurgents, al-Zarqawi terrorists and the followers of Saddam Hussein's regime, the Baathists.At this stage we are not entirely sure what the level of turnout was. Our ambassador told me a week or so ago that his estimate was that the turnout would have been around 65 per cent. That may or may not be a little high, but in any case I think we can satisfactorily judge that the turnout would have been somewhere in the vicinity of 60 per cent. The ambassador made the point to me that the turnout had been surprisingly high in Baghdad and I also understand that in Sunni areas in Mosul the turnout was much better than expected. Obviously the turnout of the Sunni community was substantially lower than other communities in Iraq because the Sunni community was subjected to the greatest intimidation. In spite of that, many of them did vote. Honourable members will be pleased to know, I am sure, that of the 12,000 or so Iraqis registered to vote in Australia, 95 per cent actually went and voted - and they were the first Iraqis in 50 years to vote in an Iraqi election. So that is a good sign.There is no question that this election makes a lie of the argument that Iraqis do not want democracy and the almost racist argument that you used to get from some commentators that Arabs do not really take to democracy. Some people have argued that Muslims do not take to democracy - Australia's next door neighbour is the world's third largest democracy. This makes a lie of those arguments. The enthusiasm that the people of Iraq showed, and the courage of those people to go out and vote, were simply extraordinary and demonstrated the fundamental love of democracy that you find all around the world. I thought it was impressive the way the Iraqi security forces - the police and the soldiers - provided security on that polling day, 30 January, in the teeth of suicide bombers, threats and intimidation. We look forward to the results of the election being released. We expect that the final results will be announced during the course of this week.In conclusion, let me say that I think Australia can be proud of the role it played in making that vote possible. Australia provided some direct support for the Iraqi Electoral Commission. The Iraqi interim government has expressed its appreciation through a letter from the Iraqi ambassador here in Canberra to officers in my department. We will continue to work with the international community - with the Americans and the British, the European Union, the Japanese and other countries in our region - to help the Iraqis secure the democracy that has now fallen within their grasp. I think that the great responsibilities that we have as a country are to make sure that democracy works, that the insurgents are defeated and not able to destroy democracy, and that the insurgents are not able successfully to foment civil war in Iraq. So we will play our part. We will do what we can to make sure that all of the millions of Iraqis who went out and voted are rewarded by the support of the international community.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I have not seen those remarks by Mr Jones. It will come as no surprise to the House if I say that Mr Jones and I do not always agree. But I will say that this is a profoundly distressing case for the reasons I outlined a few days ago. I do not intend at this stage to issue an apology. I want to know more about the circumstances, and that is why we have established the inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The National Australia Bank monthly business survey released today showed that current business conditions moderated in January, although they were coming from very robust levels. It also showed that business confidence, in original terms, surged to the highest level since October 2003, and that was backed up by the Dun and Bradstreet business expectations survey also released, which expects the June quarter to be one of the best for 12 months.Why is business optimistic and confident at the moment? One of the reasons is that the economy is growing and profitability is strong. I can inform the House that, since the House last met, we have had the December labour force figures, which showed that in December 29,000 new jobs were created in Australia and unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.In this strong employment, low unemployment, strong confidence environment what we have to do is ensure that we can sustain the capacity. We have to lift the barriers and the speed limits on the Australian economy and ensure that we do not get a build-up of wage pressure or a build-up of cost pressure. This requires strong economic reform. This government believes that strong economic reform is the key to taking Australia further. In particular, I want to name industrial relations reform as the key area of reform for the Australian economy in the future.Those political parties that want to join in economic reform will be supporting the government's program in the Senate in relation to changes on unfair dismissal, in relation to bargaining, in relation to ballots and in relation to enhancing the productive capacity of this economy. Australia needs another round of vigorous, real industrial relations reform to take us into the future and to ensure that we lift the productive capacity of this country.</DOC>

 - As I said earlier, Australia has the lowest unemployment rate for 30 years. It is absolutely true to say that 10 years ago Australia did not have skill shortages. Why? Because we had mass unemployment. The fact of the matter is that, as you get more people to work and as unemployment falls, the position of people who are bargaining for wages in an economy rises. That is one of the good downsides of a strong employment economy. I can tell the House that the government certainly has no plan, in order to contain wage costs, to drive Australia back into mass unemployment. That will not be the approach that we take.What you can do with a 30-year low unemployment rate is you can keep the economy going if you base wage increases on enhancement in productive capacity. How do you get an increase in productive capacity? You get it by a better industrial relations system, which this side of the House stands for.Let me just pick up the Leader of the Opposition on one allegation he made - that the government has somehow cut money for training. That is false. This government is now putting record amounts into technical and further education and record amounts into trade training. This is the government that introduced the New Apprenticeships scheme. This is the government that introduced a modern apprenticeship and training scheme. This is the government which announced during the course of the election the introduction of new Australian technical colleges to enhance the productive capacity of Australia. And this is the government which, on the back of that policy and other policies, received a mandate at the election and will carry through on the delivery of the policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in infrastructure, particularly in his electorate in that south-east corner of Queensland. Australia needs a national transport plan and we need the resources to back it up. While the states are the primary providers of infrastructure in Australia, the Commonwealth has a very important role to play in terms of leadership to ensure we have the national connectivity that we need and, in particular, we have the capacity to manage exports, because they are so important for jobs across the economy.We have a national transport plan - it is called AusLink - and I want to say this: it is terribly important that the states now step up to the mark and match the planning process and the increase in resources that we are providing at a national level. We are indeed providing a lot of resources over the next five years - the equivalent in today's money of two Snowy Mountain schemes. It ought to be noted that every one per cent increase in the efficiency of transport delivers something like a $500 million increase in Australia's gross domestic product.As part of this investment, we are going spend $2 billion on rail. We need to. It is worth noting that in the hands of the states we have got to the point in eastern Australia - and remember rail is your main vehicle for export performance, and there has been some focus on that in recent times with bulk commodities - where the system is essentially clogged with rail having just 17 per cent of the freight task. It is operating at capacity at that level. We will invest in the order of $2 billion over the next five years, including, for example, $260 million just in the Hunter Valley, to lift very considerably the amount of coal and commodities that can be carried to and put through the port of Newcastle. There is $150 million for rail and port links in Melbourne - Port Dynon and so forth - $110 million for links to Port Botany and the northern rail line, and there are substantial investments in Fremantle.I want to emphasise again that, whilst it is acknowledged that for economic growth, for exports, for jobs, for environmental outcomes and, indeed, for people's amenity we need a comprehensive, carefully thought through national transport plan, it is important that we plan it wisely and that we fund it wisely. That is why we have been keen to engage the states. They found a bit of this challenging, because we want to do it objectively in the future. We also want to ensure that resourcing is done properly. So we have said that the states must sign up to the national construction code. I am delighted to be able to record in here that South Australia has agreed and that, this morning, Victoria agreed. They announced that they would be agreeing to the Australian government's industrial relations reforms in relation to the construction code as it applies to road and rail construction. Good on them. We look forward to the other states rapidly following suit.</DOC>

 - I know, according to the Chinese culture, that this is the Year of the Rooster, but methinks the Leader of the Opposition has been listening a little too closely to the member for Lilley. I saw the member for Lilley last night out there like a shot out of a gun when the Reserve Bank report came out. The opposition are saying the government promised there would be no upward movements in interest rates after the election. Let me nail that for the lie that it is immediately. I can do no better than to quote a question I received - it was a very succinct question - and the answer. The question was from Neil Mitchell in an interview I had on 3AW on 23 September 2004. It reads:Mitchell: So you wouldn't be embarrassed to win the election and then have an interest rate rise?Prime Minister: Well, I don't give guarantees judgments about individual movements.That is what I said on 23 September, which was before the election. My argument - and this is the basis on which the government was re-elected; and I have no doubt that the very adverse judgment made about the opposition in relation to interest rates was material in the government's return - is that they will always be lower under our policies. That argument is supported by the last time Labor was in government and the impact of its industrial relations policy. The Leader of the Opposition, having been a self-confessed senior and self-proclaimed influential member of the Hawke and Keating governments, will well remember, as the Australian community does, the stratospheric heights of 17 per cent for housing interest rates, 20 per cent for small business rates and 21 per cent for farm bill rates when he last had his hands on the treasury bench.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question and I acknowledge his lifetime spent in caring for people in the health system up until his entry into this parliament. I can assure the member for Bowman and all members of this House that the government is committed to a 12.5 per cent mandatory price cut for new generic drugs on the PBS. We are committed to this because we want better prices for patients and we want a better deal for the taxpayer. Yesterday the government decided that this price cut would take place once within any reference pricing group. This should avoid the repeated price cuts that were feared by some in the industry, and it should still deliver the savings that were forecast by the government as part of the Charter of Budget Honesty.Importantly, this measure means that nine common types of drugs, including antidepressants, cholesterol lowering drugs and blood pressure lowering drugs, will for the first time come below the copayment, and that should mean lower prices for consumers. Some 1,500 of the 2,600 items on the PBS are currently below copayment, and many of these drugs should have lower prices for patients as a result of this measure. This government believes in the PBS as one of the important pillars of Medicare, and this measure should ensure its sustainability in the long term.</DOC>

 - Can I say that this government is running a budget surplus - that is, it is adding to savings, whereas in 1995 the government was detracting from savings. I think people recall that in 1996 the budget was $10 billion in deficit. We recall that because we remember the finance minister at the time. But in 1995 I would venture a guess that it was larger than $10 billion; I think from memory it was around $12 or $13 billion. So not only was the government not contributing to savings but the government was dissaving by an additional $12 to $13 billion over the then current account - adding significantly, I would think, to the overall deficit. In addition to that, members will recall that back in 1995 inflation was higher than it is today. So the macro fundamental environment is far stronger today than it was in 1995.But, having said that - and I will say, as I have said over and over again - we do not think that Australia should get complacent in relation to its trading position. We believe that Australia should make all efforts to increase its exports and we do have an opportunity to do so at the moment, particularly when demand for mineral commodities is strong. It appears to the government that there is demand overseas which could be met by Australian companies but which is not being met by Australian companies because of bottlenecks in Australia's export industry - in particular, bottlenecks in coal-loading ports in northern New South Wales and in Queensland.Members of the House will have heard stories or seen pictures of ships offshore waiting to pick up loads which could be earning export dollars for Australia, but they cannot get into the ports because the facilities are not great. These ports are not owned by the Commonwealth; they are not regulated by the Commonwealth. But, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we want to remove obstacles - such as are within the Commonwealth's power to remove - that could be holding back Australia's export industries. We are looking very, very closely at the structure in relation to these ports, and we will be engaging in discussions with the regulatory authorities and state governments to see whether or not improvements can be put in place.We do not want to be complacent about Australia's export performance or in relation to its current account. This country has to make every post a winner in economic reform if we are to stay where we are now, as one of the leading economies in the developed world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. Of course, coming from Western Australia, he represents a state that does disproportionately more for the Australian economy in terms of exports than most other states. Members would be aware that, in the last couple of days, the Bush administration has announced a proposal to cut $587 million from farm subsidies annually in the United States. This is good news for Australian farmers - there is no question about that. This is a very positive indication that the Bush administration is going to deliver on the commitments already made in the Doha round of global trade talks.As the events of the recent tsunami highlighted, developed countries need to do more for the world's poorest nations. This can be done through the provision of aid, but it can also be done by helping them improve their economic circumstances. The best structural way to alleviate global poverty is to eliminate barriers to trade and allow greater access to the wealthier markets of the world. I might add that this is a point that the Prime Minister made on a number of occasions to different people, world leaders and NGOs at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. It is also an issue that has been commented upon by Nelson Mandela, a great advocate for the developing world, when he said:The steps that are needed from the developed nations are clear. The first is ensuring trade justice.Therefore, we welcome the news coming from the United States that the Bush administration is to impose greater disciplines on farm subsidies in the upcoming budget. We will obviously continue to urge them to get those passed through the congress and implemented. They will help deliver the US commitments in the Doha Round of negotiations; they will help deliver greater access to their markets for the developing world and for Australian farmers but they will also help deliver a better budgetary circumstance in the United States, which will be good for the global economy.I might add that in Australia we also lead by example. We have liberalised our markets over a number of years; we have given the 49 least developed countries of the world tariff-free and quota-free access into our market and we have continued to run budget surpluses over almost the life of our government to ensure a strong economy here in Australia. I finish by saying to the member for O'Connor that this is good news coming from the United States. We will support the Bush administration in implementing their commitments in the World Trade Organisation discussions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I can indicate that, because of the workplace relations reforms that this government has put in place, we have given Australia more jobs, higher wages and the lowest unemployment in a generation. We have also produced more productive and more harmonious workplaces in the country. Indeed, under the Howard government, the level of industrial disputation has fallen to the lowest level since records were kept, and that goes back to the time of Gallipoli.However, there are exceptions to this good news, most notably in Western Australia. The rate of working days lost to industrial disputes in Western Australia has trebled since 2001. The rate of disputes in 2001 was 32 days lost per 1,000 employees. By June 2004 that had almost trebled to 121 days lost per 1,000 employees. In Western Australia in 2003 one of the worst performing industries was the construction industry, at 567 working days lost per 1,000 employees. The national all industries average is just 53. So compared to 53 for all industries across the nation, in the construction industry in Western Australia we have a disastrous situation of 567 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This is more than double what it is nationally for the construction industry throughout Australia.In Western Australia the rate has increased year by year since 2001. In 2001 it was 226, which was bad enough, but by 2003 it had blown out to 567 working days lost. No wonder I found when I was in Perth last week meeting with major resource companies which are considering billions of dollars of investment in Western Australia which would lead to increased exports for Australia and more jobs for Australians, particularly those in Western Australia, that the companies remain concerned about the militancy, particularly in the building construction union in Western Australia. This has partly come about because of a weak state government that reversed the flexible workplace relations system that the Court government had previously put in place in Western Australia and that will not stand up to the likes of those who run the CFMEU in Western Australia. It is why this government will continue to reform workplace relations in Australia so that we can have more jobs and higher wages for all Australians.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I read with interest the press release the member for Hotham put out. As you would expect, you should not believe everything that is in it. One of the things that he said in his press release was that our exports last year were equal to the worst on record. In fact, the exports last year, in 2004, were $152.5 billion. When we took over office in 1996 that figure was $100 billion. Last year it was $152.5 billion. This is the second highest figure in recorded history in Australia, the highest being in 2000-01 which was $153.5 billion. During the course of the last couple of years Australia has confronted some challenging circumstances in terms of international trade. - There has been the drought that was one of the worst in 100 years of Australia's history. And we confronted the Asian economic recession and the outbreak of SARS in East Asia, all at the same time. There was an increasing exchange rate that challenged Australia's exporters and provided a basis for stronger imports. But if you look at the economic circumstances within Australia they are the strongest that they have been for a long time. Of course, a strong, growing economy is going to draw in imports. You are going to see businesses investing in capital items and in intermediate goods that are used in re-export, so of course you are going to see a change in these figures. The member for Hotham would be well advised to look at the figures over a full 12-month period, not just over a short period of time. But the most important figures that he should compare are the export figure from 2004 of $152.5 billion and the export figure from 1996, when we first came to office, of $100 billion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for the question. Hers is one of the areas in Australia where the drought has been particularly severe. For well over two years now the federal government has been providing assistance to thousands of Australian farm families by way of income support and business support payments. Well over $600 million has been paid out now in direct payments to Australian farmers as we face this perhaps worst drought in our history. In some areas the drought has eased over recent times, and that is welcome. But in other places the grip of drought has anything but eased, and prior to Christmas I announced that the federal government would be extending exceptional circumstances for a third year in 23 areas across Australia - an unprecedented level of government support for farmers facing difficult times. Last week that list was added to for New South Wales, with assistance being extended for a third year to farmers in the Wagga area, Narrandera and Nyngan. These are areas where the drought has simply not broken and there is a need for ongoing support and assistance.The federal government has also announced new exceptional circumstances declarations in the Gundagai region and to some farmers in South Australia's upper north and is in the process of assessing an application for rice growers in the Murray Valley in New South Wales and they are receiving interim support. So the federal government has paid out significant amounts of money. Close to half of that money is for New South Wales, where the drought is perhaps the most severe. Unfortunately, though, the states are not carrying their share of the load. Indeed, in many states the state governments have walked away from their responsibilities entirely. The Victorian government now offer no assistance to drought affected farmers in their state, and there is very little provided in quite a number of the other states. They spend all their time criticising the federal government, yet we are carrying the load and helping farmers through these difficult times. It is important that the state governments commit to drought reform and work constructively to developing seamlessly with the Commonwealth a system that will provide meaningful assistance, and on time.</DOC>

 - From recollection, I think there are within Iraq at the moment three Australian diplomats. There are others who are attached to the embassy but are not necessarily in Iraq. I think the figure at the moment is that there are three. Those three diplomats are for the time being in Camp Victory, and we are intending to transfer them into the green zone, into the international zone, where they will be safer - there is no question of that. This decision was made as a result of attacks that were made against the Australian Embassy, so we are keeping the security detachment in Iraq for the time being. - But the question of how long we will keep the security detachment there and questions about the location of the security detachment will be questions considered first and foremost by the defence minister and further by the government. But, as far as the embassy is concerned, our objective is to ensure that it is moved into the green zone. I had discussions last week in Britain about possible locations, and we hope that something can be sorted out pretty soon.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his commitment to the Australian technical colleges. Last Friday I was pleased to be in Hinkler, as part of my ongoing community consultations, and to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the people of the community of Gladstone. The community partnerships they have forged between business, training and education and local government put them in a very good position to take full advantage of the framework that is offered under the Australian technical college initiative. There are 24 of these being established around the country, which is a commitment of $289 million to this initiative. It is part of the government's multifaceted strategy to address skills shortages in regional and metropolitan areas of Australia and to help young people feel very well satisfied that a genuine career path can be made by choosing the traditional trades.Last November we launched an expression of interest process that matures on the 18th of this month. Last month I launched a discussion paper to inform interested organisations and individuals. The response from local communities around Australia shows that what the government are saying - that is, that we can trust local communities to understand their local skills shortage needs best of all - is the right way to go. What we are seeing from the community meetings I have attended in Townsville, Ulverstone, Launceston, Darwin, the Gold Coast, Gladstone and Queanbeyan - and there are more to come - is the enthusiasm of local industry and community representatives to work together in ways they have never done before, to take on the commitment of up to 300 school based new apprentices in each of those areas and to make a difference.Members on both sides of this House are also assisting their local communities to generate that influence and enthusiasm, and I want to thank those members who see an Australian technical college, not only in their area but also in the broad around their particular part of Australia, as being a worthwhile initiative. I say to local communities and local businesses: 'Maintain the enthusiasm. Don't let the only two groups of people in the entire world who are against the Australian technical colleges stop you.' There are a few of them in the leadership of the Australian Labor Party here in this place and in the Australian Education Union - although I note the latest edition of Vanguard newspaper says the communists are also against it.</DOC>

 - The security detachment obviously makes assessments on a day-by-day basis in Baghdad and also in consultation with the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of the Army on the best security arrangements that they can and should make. I think we should take this opportunity of saying that the security detachment has shown great professionalism and great courage in the undertaking of their duties. There have been occasions when they have been attacked and, mercifully, whilst there have been injuries there have so far been no casualties. We very much hope and pray that that will continue to be the case. All of the decisions about the location of the security detachment and the movements of the security detachment must be made by the people on the ground in consultation with the Chief of the Defence Force. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to even endeavour to give instructions to the security detachment on what is the best location for them to be in. I do think it is appropriate that those judgments be made on the ground in the context of the environment within which they are operating. That is by far the best way to approach this question.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Moore for his question and for being prepared to stand up for the 126,000 small businesses that he has in his home state of Western Australia. I would like to reassure him that this government is providing every encouragement for small business to employ more people by, firstly, maintaining very strong economic management and, secondly and most importantly, tackling the issues that small business are concerned with. These include reducing tax - and the 25 per cent entrepreneur's tax discount will be introduced soon. They include making the tax system more flexible and reducing red tape and tackling that area of government, being local government, that most people go to first if they want to start or expand a business. There is $50 million in a fund to provide incentives for local government to reduce that amount of red tape. Importantly, it will provide a much more flexible workplace.Critically, it is only this government that is really serious about listening to the concerns of small business about unfair dismissals. The Sensis survey last year showed that 28 per cent of small businesses would not put on any more people because of their concerns about unfair dismissal. A lot of the people on the opposition front bench are laughing; they obviously are not concerned about small business. The time has come for those opposite who are laughing to stop talking about their support for small business and actually do something. Once again I invite them to join the government in supporting the legislation on unfair dismissal to actually encourage small businesses to employ more people.</DOC>

I made it quite clear in the statement I made last year that when I spoke with Mr Crooke about the position I required him to dispense with all potential conflicts of interest including A2 Milk. So I had to have known about A2 Milk. I knew about A2 Milk because they, like many others - scores and scores and scores of potential proponents for projects - often made representations through my office. - We would advise them to contact the appropriate departmental official and, if they wished, to go forward and put in an application, which would be assessed thoroughly by the department on its merits. - The reality is that you would seek departmental advice. Whenever we met with proponents, we would ask the department to join in the meeting either in my office here or, if it was at another location, by phone - as we did that day. A2 Milk, like scores of other proponents, were seeking advice on whether they should apply through the department of agriculture, through Regional Partnerships or through some other program, and the department gave them the appropriate advice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. I am pleased to inform the House that some $244 million has been paid to Australians who have made a contribution to their own superannuation this year. That has been extended to some 450,000 Australians who have incomes under $40,000 and who have made a direct contribution on their own behalf into their superannuation fund. The Howard government co-contribution is incentivising these people to go out and make these contributions and in doing so -  -  - Easily excitable, aren't we? The really good news is that 63 per cent of those who have received the incentive payment - the co-contribution of, on average, $570 - have been women. That is a very positive thing for Australian women because the more females who make a contribution for their superannuation, their retirement income, and who are supported by this government, the stronger incomes they are going to have into the future and the less likely there is going to be a drag on the budget in the years to come - as the Treasurer's demographic papers in the past have shown how we are an ageing population. So there will be less of a drag in the future. This is happening because the federal coalition government has given people an incentive to go out there and save for their own retirements, and some 450,000 Australians are doing just that - that is, 450,000 payments that have already been made by the Taxation Office.To put this into context, it means a 35-year-old woman today on a $25,000 annual income who continues to contribute $570 towards her savings in superannuation will increase her real income in retirement by $60,000 - a 48 per cent real increase. This is good news for Australian low-income earners. The better news is that this year lower to middle income earners will not get a dollar for dollar contribution; they will get $1.50 for every dollar that they contribute. The challenge for the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, is to repudiate the policy that the Labor Party took to the last campaign where they were going to remove this incentive and restate this as good government policy that should be supported by all parties.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those remarks. I am also aware of some other remarks made by the family, and I respect their feelings. This is a difficult case but the Leader of the Opposition must know that in a situation like this the government has to take a balanced approach and not automatically do what is requested of it by an individual family. The person who has been appointed has great experience, and he is widely respected on both sides of the House. I would have thought that, in a matter that involved an investigation into how somebody was taken into detention who it is claimed should not have been in detention, somebody with the police experience of Mick Palmer was quintessentially the right person to do the inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I know he was an observer at the Palestinian election. He did an excellent job, and we look forward to reading his report. The elections there were very positive.Australia welcomes the summit meeting that took place yesterday in Sharm El Sheikh, in Egypt, between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the new President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. We are encouraged by the announcement out of this summit of a cessation of violence, which of course is a fundamental prerequisite for peace. After four years of violent conflict and with some 4,700 people having been killed by both sides during the intifada, this clearly is a very important step forward. We would urge both sides to do what they can to try to take advantage of this agreement and maintain the momentum for peace.These are the best prospects we have seen for quite some time for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The two-state solution, which must be the solution to the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians, is now within reach. The road map to peace in the Middle East, as the peace process is called, is really the only path forward, and it is important that it be embraced by all.We continue to provide our practical support as best we can to the Palestinian people through our aid program. This financial year we budgeted for $12 million worth of aid for the Palestinian people, and we urge the Palestinians to do everything they can within their power to stop extremists committing acts of violence. We also urge the Israelis to fulfil their part of the road map. It is not a question of being rosy-eyed about this. We have to think clearly about it and understand the risks and dangers. This encouraging development has followed on from what I think were enormously important elections within the Palestinian territories. The government is enormously encouraged that we are increasingly seeing democracy in places where democracy was, at best, half-hearted. We have seen elections in the Palestinian territories. In the Ukraine there was finally a free and democratic election. In Afghanistan, there were democratic elections, which so many people said would not be possible. Above all, in Iraq, and despite the intimidation, we have seen a free election with a very substantial turnout. It is an enormous moment for the international community to see democracy spreading. The international community can rest assured that Australia will always be there to support it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Today Westpac released consumer sentiment for February which, although it showed a slight decline - falling by 0.6 per cent - is still the third highest level of consumer confidence in the 30-year history of the survey since the survey began in 1974. In fact, over the last year consumer sentiment has risen 3½ per cent to be 22 per cent above the long-term average, which is quite extraordinary.Why are Australian consumers recording such high levels of sentiment at the moment? Labour market conditions are the best they have been for 30 years, with unemployment down to 5.1 per cent. Household disposable income has been growing around nine per cent per annum, driven by strong employment and solid real wages growth. I do want to make this point: it is the government's view that we would like to see real wage increases, unlike Labor, which championed the cause of real wage decline during the 1980s, but we know that real wage increases can only be based on productivity. In addition, household wealth has grown quite significantly over the last two years.As people start filing their tax returns, those eligible families that are on family tax benefit part A will also be receiving, again, a $600 lump sum, notwithstanding the fact that Labor's new so-called economic spokesman maintains the money does not exist. I was doing a radio interview last week and the commentator pointed out to me that, with four children, he got $2,400 last year. I asked him what he did with it. He said he bought a greyhound and he called it `Lump Sum'. The money was not provided so that you could buy greyhounds but it was the first time I ever heard you could buy a greyhound without real money - a lot of people have lost real money on greyhounds. Families will be eligible for a second payment once they lodge their income tax return. That is real money which parents throughout Australia are able to spend on things that they need for their children and that they need to look after their families. As I said, this government believes that it is important that we continue to drive economic reform, that we continue to keep unemployment low and that we continue to keep productivity strong. That is what economic reform is all about. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and, indeed, his interest. Australia, as the House knows, along with the international community, warmly welcomed the elections that took place in Iraq on 30 January. As an international community, not just here in Australia, we recognise that those elections were a turning point and we now have to do everything we can to help the Iraqi people. We have an Army training team which is assisting the Iraqi army develop a sufficient logistic capability, and we have already trained up three Iraqi army battalions and the brigade headquarters staff. The Australian Federal Police are also contributing to a police training centre in Jordan.When I was in Europe last week I was very impressed by the strength of support there is now in Europe - if it had not always been the case - to do what the Europeans can to make a democratic and free Iraq work. The mood in the whole of Europe today is to get together with the United States and help the people of Iraq. The NATO Secretary-General, for example, has made it perfectly clear that NATO itself is going to try to assist with the overall training task. When I was in France the French foreign minister and also the defence minister told me that France itself was playing a role in training security forces and wanted to continue to do so in an upgraded way. The German foreign minister, who has been here over the last few days, has made it perfectly clear that Germany is committed to providing training. I make the point that there are 28 countries which have some troops on the ground in Iraq. The member for Barton in an interview the other day expressed great surprise that there were so many countries there. There are others that are making contributions in different ways, and it is delightful to see the international community coming together and supporting a new, emerging democracy in Iraq and supporting a free people.Last night the Leader of the Opposition did an interview on Lateline and was asked questions about Iraq. He is only new in the job, so I think all of us would agree that we should not be too hard on him. But I thought the House might be interested in just what the Leader of the Opposition said. He said:What I'm suggesting now is that the United States should indicate to the incoming government a belief that that government should now negotiate a compromise with the Sunni forces in the country, and that the United States did not want to be drawn into the vortex of that by being readily manipulated every now and then to give the Sunnis a swat while that government sought to put a bit of extra pressure on them, and that, really, the ball was now in their court, and the US wanted to get itself into a position where it was no longer the first responder in the area.I am exhausted; 106 words in one sentence, and I am not sure anybody had any idea what that sentence meant. But I believe a 106-word sentence is pretty close to a record for any member of this parliament.</DOC>

I am not surprised that the member for Dobell was out there advocating for this very important project, the dredging of Tumbi Creek, which was supported at the time by the Labor Party. Their candidate in Dobell was running around saying that this was an excellent project and that the Labor Party supported it. Yet now they are in this House saying that they do not agree with the project.The Regional Partnerships program, since it was established on 1 July 2003, has received 1,070 applications. As of 31 December 2004, a total of $113 million of Australian government funding has been approved for some 504 projects. Regional Partnerships is a good program. It deals with real issues, providing real benefits to the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and acknowledge his very great interest in infrastructure in Victoria. I have to say he is not the only one. We have quite a group of people who have been very keen to see Scoresby get up and to see the national highway through the north of Victoria upgraded. Indeed, under our transport plan for the nation, AusLink, we are proposing something in the order of a 120 per cent increase in funding for Victoria alone over the next five years compared to the last five years, reflecting the very real infrastructure needs up and down the east coast and in Victoria in particular.Australia does need better road and rail infrastructure, but we need to ensure that we get value for money. I recorded here yesterday that I was delighted that South Australia has signed up to our construction code, and I am delighted to see too that Victoria has agreed to important industrial relations reforms, by agreeing to our industrial relations construction code objectives. That code will deliver high-quality, efficient and economical construction of major road and rail projects. It will drive taxpayers' dollars further - and that is very important.In relation to Victoria, all we need to get the ball rolling is for Victoria to sign off on the bilateral which we have been negotiating for a long time. I do not think there should be any problem there at all. Once the Victorian and South Australian governments have signed the AusLink bilateral agreements, Australian government money will flow to those very important projects right across their states. And we trust that other states will follow shortly. We trust that they will get the buzz that this is too good an opportunity to miss out on.There has been a bit of background static about Scoresby in Victoria. Let me reiterate that they have always known in Victoria that we signed an agreement that we would fund Scoresby as a freeway, not a tollway. Our money remains on the table. I want to stress that, whilst it is our position that where there was a written promise it ought to be honoured, we will not hold up AusLink in Victoria on this matter. We simply make the point: sign the bilateral and get the projects going. If you will not build a freeway for the people in that part of Melbourne, that is okay. We will not put any money towards it, but that is no reason to hold the rest of it up. We want to get those projects going. They are important for exports, they are important for jobs, they are important for amenity and they are important environmentally. I urge all states, including Victoria, to sign up so that we can get those major projects going - the sooner, the better.</DOC>

The dredging of Tumbi Creek was an important project, remains an important project and is a project which was supported by the Labor candidate at the last election, who was running around all over the Central Coast saying, `We support this project.' It is an important project and it is part of a very important Australian government project - Regional Partnerships. I have nothing further to add to my previous answer. Thank you. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. The member for Grey represents an electorate that covers a large part of South Australia, an electorate that makes a significant contribution to the economic wellbeing of Australia. The simple answer is that our export performance last year - in the calendar year 2004 - was very good. Our exports rose, both in value terms and in volume terms. For the information of the House, in 2004 our exports rose by $11.7 billion, to finish the year at $152½ billion worth of goods and services exported out of Australia, earning much needed dollars for our economy.The growth was recorded in all sectors. Rural exports grew by 20 per cent - that is an important element of the member for Grey's constituency; resources exports increased by 13 per cent; services exports grew by 5 per cent; and manufacturing exports grew by 2 per cent. The House should recognise that, when analysing trade performance, you need to factor both merchandise and services into the equation. In volume terms exports rose by 7 per cent over the first three-quarters of last year - the figures are only available up until September. So in volume terms and value terms both merchandise and services achieved significant increases through the calendar year last year.Our export performance would be even better if our exporters did not have to deal with some industrial action taken by some of the trade unions in Australia like the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union. It is interesting to note that in January both Toyota and Holden were forced to import automotive quality steel into Australia to keep their production lines going, because of industrial action being taken by the CEPU at BlueScope Steel. Can you believe it? Holden and Toyota were flying steel into Australia in Antonov aircraft. Our nation is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, and we are buying steel offshore to keep our manufacturing industries going. Kirby Adams, the Managing Director of BlueScope Steel, had something very instructive to say about this:It is an unfortunate truth, and not widely stated, that the irresponsible actions of a few union leaders and officials are creating real hesitation about new and large scale manufacturing investment in this country.That is not the government saying that; that is the managing director of Bluescope Steel. The Australian Labor Party should be cognisant of what industry is saying in this regard.One of the reasons our government wants to reform the Australian workplace is so that our exporters of manufactured goods are not held to ransom by militant union leaders. If the opposition wants to make a contribution to this debate they should support the government's reforms in the Australian workplace to ensure that our exporters do not have to be confronted by this. But we do know that that is probably unlikely, given that since 1995 the Australian Labor Party has received something like $3.3 million in donations from the CEPU. So, if the Labor Party want to help the manufacturing industries and help Australia's export effort, they can get the unions off the back of the manufacturers. </DOC>

 - I welcome the question - the third question on this issue from the member opposite. I have been advised that a Wyong Shire Council engineer reported to Wyong council at their December meeting in 2004 that the November rain had not removed any of the sludge and that in fact the full funding and the removal of 15,000 cubic metres of sludge was necessary. - Whilst I am on my feet, I thought the House might be interested in a brochure that was circulated in the last election campaign by the Labor candidate for Dobell, David Mehan. The brochure has a lovely photo of David and says:Labor's candidate for Dobell, David Mehan, says Labor will fund the dredging of Tumbi Creek with a commitment of $1.3 million to continue the project.I table the brochure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and particularly his interest in continuing investment in the state of Victoria. The government is committed to reforming the building and construction industry to see the end of unlawful, inefficient and unproductive practices. That is why we have implemented the national code and guidelines for this $46 billion industry - to ensure that lawful practices are put in place, especially where billions of dollars of Commonwealth funding are concerned. I was, therefore, pleased that the Victorian government announced yesterday that it had agreed to implement the national code of practice for AusLink funded projects. This is a crucial element in the government's reform program to see that laws are properly observed in the commercial building and construction industry.The decision of the Victorian government follows that of another Labor state government in South Australia. I look forward now to all of the other states and territories agreeing - as both South Australia and Victoria now have - to implement the code and the guidelines. I note that, for example, there is a certain political event occurring in Western Australia at the present time. This would be an excellent opportunity for Premier Gallop to announce that Western Australia will follow the lead of both Victoria and South Australia. I hope that the other state premiers will also come on board in the near future. I and my department will continue to work constructively, as we have done with both South Australia and Victoria, to bring about this important reform.</DOC>

I have been a member of this House long enough to know that I should check everything that the opposition says, and I will check with my department. I want to re-emphasise that this project was subject to the standard rigorous assessment process of my department. Initially Wyong Shire Council sought $748,000 from the Regional Partnerships program. This was based on the expectation that the New South Wales Labor government would also support the project. But, when the hopes of the local residents were dashed by the Carr government, despite our commitment, we ensured that this project would proceed - and I am very pleased that we were able to ensure that the project would proceed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I can tell the House that she is rapidly developing the reputation as the best member Greenway has ever had. - The Howard government, as the member for Greenway well knows, is fully committed to our Medicare system and is always looking for ways to improve further the world's best health system. On 1 January, the government implemented two important election commitments. The first, `100% Medicare', means a $4.60 increase in the standard GP rebate. The second, Round the Clock Medicare, means a $10 loading for after-hours GP services. These commitments mean more money for GPs who bulk-bill and they mean more money in the pockets of patients whose GPs do not bulk-bill. I can inform the House that in January some six million Australians visited their GPs and took advantage of these new Howard government initiatives. That meant that GPs and their patients benefited to the tune of an additional $30 million in one month alone. Australians know that they can trust the Howard government with the Medicare system. They know that they can trust the Howard government to make a good system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and I give my regards to the very high quality teachers at the Armadale school in his electorate. Apart from us, as parents, the single most important influence on the lives of our children is their teachers. They, apart from parents, most influence the educational and personal development of young Australians. This government believes that the No. 1 priority in school education in Australia is to raise the respect society has for teaching as a profession and also to ensure that the teaching profession is supported in setting and maintaining its own performance standards for both school leaders and teachers. To that end, the government has committed $10 million initially to the establishment of the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership at ANU, to both set and define nationally consistent standards for teacher education throughout Australia. In addition to that, there is a range of other initiatives, including the direct support of ongoing teacher training and $109 million, for example, for improving teacher undergraduate education and the higher education reforms.It was with a great sense of dismay and concern that I read the editorial of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English professional journal, which was published today in part on the front page of the Australian. The President of the New South Wales English Teachers Association, who is also the immediate past chairman of the New South Wales Board of Studies English Curriculum Committee, has written an editorial which seeks to demean and denigrate, firstly, his own colleagues in the teaching of English; secondly, the students of English throughout Australia; and, thirdly, the position of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister personally.I will not give dignity to what has been written by repeating it in the House, but Professor Sawyer, for example, believes that we have gone beyond what he describes as `critical' education. He said:We are the only area of the curriculum that has all the students. We should be making a difference.And this is in an editorial that expresses a strident criticism of Australians for choosing to re-elect the Howard government late last year, bemoaning that fact. I would suggest to Professor Sawyer's colleagues that they should review his capacity to serve in any professional capacity on behalf of any teacher organisation in Australia.This also confirms what many parents suspect, and that is that a minority of teachers use the classroom to impose their own partisan political views on their students. Whether they are pro coalition or pro another party, there is no place for political cheerleading in a classroom. I would say to Professor Sawyer that just maybe he underestimates his own colleagues. Just maybe those young people who have been taught English in Australia do recognise the need for an Australian government that will protect and defend Australia's borders, that will stop people paying to get their way into Australia, that recognises the need for short-term political cost to reform Australia's tax system, to stand up against terrorism and to stand up on the side of those who seek justice throughout the world. As far as I am concerned, Professor Sawyer's colleagues and his employers should seriously review his place in any position of leadership. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. I was most impressed with his interest in and his understanding of aged care issues in his electorate when I visited last year. Unlike Labor, the Howard government recognises that an increasing number of older Australians wish to remain at home as they age, and their families are looking for more options and more choices for their older Australians. That is why the government has increased the number of community aged care packages - that is, low-level care delivered at home - from some 4,400 packages when we first came to office to over 31,000 packages that are available for community care today. That is an increase of about 700 per cent, yet the age group over 70 has increased by only perhaps 20 per cent during that time. We have also introduced the innovative extended aged care at home packages, which are an extension of community care, to cover situations where people require high-level nursing home care but delivered at home. We will deliver on our election commitment to provide a further 2,000 extended aged care at home packages which are dementia specific - targeted for people who have specific needs because they are suffering from dementia.In relation to community care packages, in January I was delighted to announce that a further 2,818 community aged care and extended aged care at home packages were subsidised by the Australian government and allocated across Australia. In Tasmania, some 65 places were allocated, and I know the member for Bass was pleased to announce 20 places in his electorate. This government is concerned with the needs and interests of older Australians. By supporting and delivering more community aged care, we are realising our vision of a world-class system of aged care, a system that is high quality, affordable, accessible and provides choice and options for older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his interest in economic matters. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its labour force figures for the month of January, which showed that in the month of January just past there were 44,500 new jobs created in Australia. The unemployment rate remained steady at 28-year lows of 5.1 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that the participation rate increased to 64.1 per cent. That shows that more people started looking for work - and they were able to find it, with the 44,500 jobs that were created.More importantly, with the 44,500 jobs which were created in the month of January, the number of jobs created since March 1996, when the coalition was elected, has now for the first time passed 1.5 million new jobs. What are the factors that have allowed that to happen? A medium-term fiscal framework, the reduction of Commonwealth debt, the locking in of inflation targeting, a low-interest rate environment, a more productive taxation system, continuing tariff reductions - all of these things have contributed to bringing that unemployment rate down. The unemployment rate peaked in 1992, at 10.9 per cent. - Since the Labor Party interject, let me say that many members will not remember who the employment minister in Australia was in December 1992. He is studiously reading the Mackerras pendulum, Mr Speaker. But what can be done to increase employment in Australia? We need to continue the reform progress, and more important than any other reform is reform of Australia's labour markets. We cannot have a situation where we see unjustified wage increases which are not based on productivity, as we have seen in relation to some state governments recently. If we have a strong employment economy, we need to lift our productive capacity so that wages can grow in line with productivity, inflation can be kept low and Australia can strengthen its economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. Let me assure the House that the Australian government value our current and former members of the Defence Force. Their safety and wellbeing is absolutely paramount. Defence is taking this very seriously.In response to the member's question, I would firstly like to outline the steps that are being taken at present. We are establishing mechanisms through DVA for a beryllium information service for concerned ADF members and former members to receive factual information and also to register on a roll so that we have an opportunity to contact them individually and directly. There is a posting on the DVA web site of comprehensive information about beryllium related exposure. The information service will be operational in approximately seven days. Individuals will also be contacted in writing.But I do want to deal with the concerns that the member has quite rightly raised. Firstly, serious illness resulting in beryllium exposure is quite rare, fortunately - and I think that will be reassuring to those who are at the moment most anxious about this matter. The other thing is that a claims process has been in place - through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, not Defence, because DVA is the sister organisation that deals with claims - since DVA processed its first beryllium related claim in 1999. I will outline to the House the process for making a claim. I know that members of the House will want to share it with those who contact their electorate office. Any member of Defence or previous serving member or veteran who has a concern about their health can make a claim. The formal process involves a person making the claim with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is then an onus on DVA to search out, through service and medical records, any service related matter that could have impacted on that person's health. If necessary, the department also refers that person to a doctor and a medical specialist. In order to have the claim assessed they need to prove incapacity resulting from the disease and that there has been exposure related to service. Once all of those factors are checked through -  - I will get to that answer, if I may, in a moment. -  - I am surprised that the Labor Party finds this to be something they can taunt. This is a serious issue concerning people's health and we are addressing it with great speed. The question is: how can people make a claim when they do not know whether they have had exposure? The reality is that claims related to beryllium have already been processed. The fact that people are unaware of their exposure will not prevent them lodging a claim or it ultimately being successful if they have a health impact and if they have a service related exposure. The question is: why was the search of records not undertaken and people advised? As I said before, serious illness from beryllium exposure is quite rare, fortunately, and we should all be thankful for that. To needlessly cause anxiety to large groups of people by advising them of exposure when the likelihood of any illness is rare would simply be unreasonable. However, the matter has been raised. People are anxious and we are moving at great speed to give them accurate information about their records. Those are presently being checked by Navy. They will all be contacted individually from the roll that is being prepared. I want to assure our service men and women and our veterans, whom we value highly, that DVA, together with Defence, are there to process claims. If people are entitled to compensation care, income support, they will receive it as is appropriate. We place great importance on our service men and women.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I appreciate that he is one of the members who is very concerned about the safety and security of the Iraqi people and their passion for democracy. The counting from the elections that took place on 30 January is still proceeding and the Iraqi Electoral Commission said overnight that a recount would be needed in some 300 ballot boxes. As a result, that will push back the announcement of the final results by a few days. Nevertheless, I hardly need to remind the House that the fact that so many Iraqis - eight million to nine million - reportedly went out to vote on polling day despite threats of intimidation and violence was a remarkable demonstration of the support of the ordinary people of Iraq for freedom and for democracy.I note in response to the second part of the member for Mitchell's question that the United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, met with NATO Foreign Ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels during the course of last night - our time - after which she said that these were `the best discussions of Iraq that we have had as an alliance,' and `We know what the work is to be done ahead.' Can I say how much we welcome that sentiment. I found very much the same point of view when I was at NATO headquarters just a week ago. There is a real determination amongst the NATO partners, including countries like France and Germany, to try to make the new free and democratic Iraq work on behalf of the millions of people of Iraq who want that type of a future for themselves. There are very few people in Iraq who want to see that country return to tyranny.We know that one of the principal tasks - not the only task - in Iraq is to train up the Iraqi security forces: the army, the police. There are about 120,000-130,000 people so far in the Iraqi security forces. The security forces are not big enough and they are not strong enough to be able to confront the insurgents at this stage. More needs to be done. Out of the NATO meeting - I think this will be reiterated at the NATO summit that President Bush will be at on 22 February - there is a unanimous commitment to support the training task in Iraq. In Australia, unfortunately, we were told by the Leader of the Opposition - when he first became the Leader of the Opposition this time around - that we needed to have a more complicated debate on Iraq. As I pointed out yesterday, sentences with 106 words in them are certainly complicated.The point is that the Labor Party in a year has had 16 different positions on the issue of troops in Iraq. The current position is that they kind of half support the security detachment remaining, at least for a little while, but they are not quite sure and they do not want to listen to the advice from the Chief of the Defence Force or the Chief of Army - they are not important. Politics is more important than that, according to the Labor Party. But when it comes to the troops we have in Iraq, who are undertaking the training tasks, who are contributing to training the Iraqi people, the Leader of the Opposition - who claims to be the world's foremost expert on security issues - says that is not an issue. Actually, it is an issue, and we would like to know from the Leader of the Opposition whether the Labor Party, in its 16th position, moving to its 17th position, believes that we should be making a contribution to the training of the Iraqi security forces. He has been asked this question on Lateline and a number of other programs and he never answers it. Why? Because the Labor Party is deeply divided on the issue of Iraq. And we are proud of the role we played in helping the Iraqi people achieve democracy. </DOC>

 - I made a full and open statement to the House yesterday evening. I see these allegations as very serious. I take them as being serious. I have investigated these allegations in my office and in my department. I turn to the question of the emails. I would like to go through the details that I have before me here. Firstly, I did not see the emails in question until yesterday afternoon when they were brought to this House. Secondly, neither my chief of staff nor I were consulted about the text of the emails before or after they were sent. Thirdly, I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition checks a draft of every single email that is sent by his staff - and I am sure that no other member of parliament is in a position to check every email that is sent from their office.Fourthly, while I have spoken to the staff member concerned and have indicated to him that the wording of the emails was inappropriate, the House should bear in mind that he sent with that two-line covering email the department's advice which made clear the purpose for the grants, that if the purposes of the grant were not to be met then that would affect the level of funding and that the project would not be revised to include outcomes beyond those agreed by Mrs Kelly without a formal request by council and reconsideration by the parliamentary secretary, the Hon. John Cobb. Mr Hallett has provided me with a statement on this matter which puts his handling of the issue into its proper context. I wish to table a copy of that statement. Whilst I am on my feet, I have also received letters from the Wyong Shire Council Mayor and the general manager detailing their handling of the matter. This indicates that the council has also handled the matter properly. I wish to table those two letters. I also want to quote a section from this letter from the Mayor, Brenton Pavier, dated 10 February, addressed to me. It says:Dear MinisterI refer to the accusations made yesterday in Federal Parliament and confirm that neither I nor any of my Councillors sought to influence any report going to Council in late last year on the matter of Tumbi Creek.The letter continues:I find it repugnant and a slur on the character and the professional Directorship of Wyong Council to infer that a doctored report was produced for political end.I table those two letters. What does concern me is that, with no evidence, the Leader of the Opposition has sought to slur the good name of the hardworking officials of Wyong Shire Council, people in my department and people in my office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. Like so many other members here, she is only too aware of the fact that we do need more doctors in our country. The government has put measures in place to improve not only the supply of doctors but also the distribution of doctors to places of work force shortage. This year 1,664 students will commence publicly funded medical studies. This is a 17 per cent increase over 2003. Since December 2003, 1,144 overseas trained doctors have extended their visas from two to four years. An additional 259 overseas trained doctors have arrived or signed employment contracts to work in Australia under the Strengthening Medicare measures announced last year. In addition, under the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas measure, which started in March 2003, some 445 doctors, including 247 GP registrars, have shifted to areas of work force shortage, mostly from inner metropolitan areas. I note that the member for Lalor's electorate has benefited from this measure. There are nine additional doctors in the member for Lalor's electorate thanks to this particular measure of the government, and I do look forward to receiving her letter of appreciation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and her ongoing support for a flexible workplace relations system which means more jobs for more Australians. Each year thousands of employers and employees right across Australia have embraced the flexibility which is available under the federal system. Indeed, some 619,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into in Australia since they were introduced in 1997. In 2004, AWA approvals grew by 42 per cent.There is one state in Australia which has embraced AWAs more than any other to date, and that is the state of Western Australia. In fact, Western Australia now accounts for 32 per cent - almost one-third - of Australian workplace agreements, yet has only 10 per cent of the Australian population. Last year, almost 58,000 AWAs were entered into in Western Australia. Let me break that down to a couple of electorates. In the electorate of Brand, which the honourable Leader of the Opposition represents in this place, there were 10,948 people working under AWAs in 2004. In the electorate of Perth, there were 13,207 - people like the employees at Catalano Seafoods that I visited last year. That company was able to move more of its casual employees into permanent work because of the use and the flexibility of Australian workplace agreements.This 58,000 can be contrasted to the failed system which the Gallop government has put in place in Western Australia with their so-called employer-employee agreements - not 58,000, as we have had with the federal Australian workplace agreements, but in 2003-04 there were just 210 of the Gallop government individual agreements. So 58,000 use the flexibility of the federal system compared to just 210 struggling through all the complexity of the Western Australian system. What we have in Western Australia is workers voting with their feet, moving from the state system across to the federal system. In Western Australia now we have the Gallop government presiding over not only the strike capital of Australia but a mass exodus of workers into a more flexible and certain federal system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Everyone in this House would recognise that there is a deep concern in the Australian community about road trauma. We have made tremendous progress over the last 30 years with the advent of seatbelts, drink-driving laws, better cars and better roads. But even though we rejoice in the fact that we had our lowest Christmas road toll on record this year, the fact is that too many die on our roads, and young Australians in particular are overrepresented in the figures. I found it truly horrific to discover that a young Australian male between the ages of 18 and 21 is 10 times more likely to die on our roads than a man in his 40s.It is understandable that people expect us to do something about this. We had a forum here because Minister Lloyd and I are very determined to take forward world's best practice - if I can put it that way - in this country. We pulled together local and international experts. We established, amongst other things - and I would like all members who are interested in this to take this on board because it is very sobering and it is something to point out to young people - that the time at which drivers are most likely, by a horrendous factor, to die is in the few months after they get their P-plates. After they have been through their L-plates, there is something that happens to young people when they get their P-plates that induces them to think, `I can now drive.' Sometimes the results are truly tragic. The international experience is the same.In recognition of this, we are doing a world first in Australia. We are going to select 14,000 young drivers for an exhaustive trial. Shortly after receiving their licence, those drivers will be taken through a series of short coaching sessions - about an hour each, seven or eight hours in total for each of our young drivers in the 14,000 trial group. Through that process, we will be seeking to challenge them in areas where they are not driving well and seeking to get them to recognise the limitations of their own skill sets, the motor cars that they are driving, the roads and the traffic circumstances under which they travel. We will be monitoring it very closely to try to get an accurate handle on the measures that will most improve the possibilities for our young people not dying on our roads.I think this will have the total support of the Australian community. I welcome the support we have had from a number of the state governments, and in particular New South Wales and Victoria. I do not discriminate against any other government except to make the point that they will be participating in the trial with us. We have support from the vehicle industry, and I thank them for that; from the insurance industry; and from the motoring organisations, in particular the RACV.It is my objective - and I think it would be shared by everyone in this House on a bipartisan basis - not only to save lives but to ensure that young drivers can enjoy the privileges and advantages of motoring in a way that maximises their safety and reduces to the absolute minimum the road toll in this country. </DOC>

 - I have provided a full statement from Mr Hallett in relation to those emails, but can I take the time to remind the House of the substance of this issue. The department's advice, as forwarded by Mr Hallett to the council, made it clear that they were awaiting advice from the council on the impact of recent movements at the mouth of Tumbi Creek. Council, through its director of engineering services, considered the status of Tumbi Creek, and the director of engineering services reported on the situation and the scope of works to council on 24 November. The substance of the report was that, while approximately 1,000 cubic metres of spoil had been disposed of by the recent rains, they were dealing with a situation in which 15,000 cubic metres needed to be dealt with. The director of engineering services concluded:In terms of raising the issue about is there any need to do any further work?' It is a very valid question and it is indeed worthwhile identifying and that is what we've done but further work does need doing.A copy of the transcript of those remarks to council was tabled in the House last night, and I tabled the letters from the mayor and general manager. I would now like to take the opportunity to table a staff memorandum from K. Yates, General Manager, Wyong Shire Council. It is dated 10 February 2005. It is to the mayor, Councillor Brenton Pavier. It is headed `Tumbi Creek' and it says:I refer to the allegations in the Federal Parliament yesterday that Minister Lloyd's office pressured council staff in the preparation of reports on Tumbi Creek.As you are aware, all reports from staff to council are approved by me prior to submission to Council. I have on a number of occasions, pointed out to Council that reports provide the professional advice and recommendations from staff regardless of the position of Council on any issue. Indeed, the Local Government Act provides that Council may direct staff to prepare a report but neither Council nor individual Councillors may direct or attempt to influence, the content or recommendations of a report.This was certainly the case in respect to Tumbi Creek. Neither Minister Lloyd's office nor any other person sought to influence the Director of Engineering Services in the preparation of these reports or influence me in approving their submission to Council.I table that staff memorandum.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and acknowledge his interest in our expanding export effort, particularly from his electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Australia's trade relationship with Malaysia and the overall economic relationship have been steadily improving. Malaysia is now Australia's 10th largest trading partner, with two-way trade standing at $9.7 billion. Interestingly, in some discussions we have had a bit of focus on the services sector; the services trade between the two countries is $1.7 billion. The House would be aware that Australia and Malaysia are conducting parallel scoping studies on a possible free trade agreement. The scoping studies should be concluded in the early part of this year - by the end of March. The objectives of a possible free trade agreement, and the benefits, would see further reductions in tariff barriers in agriculture, greater investment flows both ways and better access for our services sector, particularly legal firms and educational institutions. The member for Cowper has a great tertiary institution in his electorate called Southern Cross University, which continues to expand.Today, I launched a report by my department called Malaysia: an economy transformed, which is designed to help Australian business capitalise on the expanding and growing opportunities in the Malaysian market. It shows that a FTA would build on the strong links that we have with Malaysia across a broad range of areas, particularly in education, defence, security and tourism. I know the Minister for Education, Science and Training would agree that we have a very strong education relationship with Malaysia. There are currently about 20,000 Malaysian students studying in Australian educational institutions. They will add to the 200,000 Malaysians that have already been educated in Australia's tertiary education system, which certainly builds on the very strong basis of the relationship between the two countries.They make up a significant part of our services exports to Malaysia, which are currently worth $972 million. About 30 per cent of our exports to Malaysia are services, which is above our average overall export effort - the services sector accounts for, I think, around 22 per cent of exports. It is important and very significant to note the importance of the services trade with Malaysia. You would not think that the ALP would need to be reminded of the importance of the services sector, given that the unions that represent the services sector in Australia donated about $2.2 million to the ALP's coffers. Given some of the comments made by some of the ALP spokesmen on this, they tend to ignore the importance of services trade in the overall export effort from Australia, where, in 2004, services exports rose by five per cent to $34 billion. Thirty-four billion dollars was earned for the Australian economy; that is, 22 per cent of our export wealth in 2004 was generated by the services sector. Therefore, a key objective of a possible free trade agreement with Malaysia is to expand on that already large services export to Malaysia.</DOC>

I tabled a report from the director of engineering services yesterday, which indicated that there still needed to be much further work done on Tumbi Creek. My understanding is that about 1,000 cubic metres of sludge was flushed out from the creek during the floods, but there is some 13,000 to 14,000 cubic metres of sludge that still needs to be removed from the creek.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question, because this government is committed to preventing high-income earners, including barristers, from shielding their real assets from their creditors. It is our duty to ensure that creditors are protected and that the bankruptcy system is not misused. We could not allow some bankrupts to live the high life while their creditors remain unpaid. The Commonwealth, working with the states and territories, has taken action to ensure that bankrupt barristers who avoid their debts cannot practice. We have led the way by asking all departments and agencies to ensure that they do not brief counsel who use bankruptcy as a means of avoiding tax.This week, I have released a discussion paper which contains a range of options on which we are asking for suggestions to further strengthen the Bankruptcy Act. We did listen to concerns about previous proposals that we put forward. Some people put the view that they perhaps went further than was necessary, and we are asking those persons who offered comments to the House of Representatives committee - the stakeholders - to review the changes that we are suggesting could be pursued. We are seeking their comments by 31 March. Of course, this contrasts with the opposition who, in relation to another enactment dealing with family law and bankruptcy, have proposed amendments that are ill conceived and only go part of the way to resolving the issues. In fact, they would not be wholly effective on their own and would only potentially be part of a package of reforms if they were really intent on addressing the problems. Acknowledgment of this by the opposition occurred in the Senate when Senator Ludwig said, `I accept the view that it is not sufficient and it does not cover all the bases.' It is important that these inadequate amendments do not delay the passage of the important family law and bankruptcy reforms that we are proposing. I would urge the opposition to support the government in its determination to consult widely and act properly in ensuring the integrity of the bankruptcy system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney, one of the absolutely impressive new members of the class of 2004 on this side. We are delighted that he is here today and I know he is making a great mark in his electorate and beyond already. I am happy to report the number of apprentices in training has increased from just 141,000 in 1995 under Labor to almost 400,000 today under this government. This is a direct result of the high priority that the government has given to ensuring that young Australians have greater opportunities to take up new apprenticeships. Over the last two years the government has made a major additional investment in new apprenticeships. This is a vital element of our comprehensive approach to addressing skills needs in Australian industry. During the election campaign the Howard government announced a further $1.06 billion in new funding over four years for vocational education and training. This is simply one of the most significant boosts ever undertaken by any government in our nation's history. In particular, we are helping to ease the financial burden that is faced by apprentices in the first few years of their trade. The honourable member would be interested to know that we have provided just over $90 million over three years to provide toolkits up to the value of $800 for new apprentices who are in the trades where there is a skills shortage. - The Treasurer is asking when, because he has to pay for this by his good, strong financial management. The answer is 1 July 2005. They will begin to flow from the first of October. This will help up to 34,000 new apprentices a year in trades experiencing skills needs such as metals, motor vehicles, carpentry, plumbing, chefs and cooks, cabinet making, furniture making and hairdressing trades. They will be provided to new apprentices at the end of their three-month probationary period and the first apprentices will benefit from October this year. Eligible new apprentices will be able to keep their toolkits after completing a further six months of their apprenticeships.Also from 1 July, a $500 Commonwealth trade learning scholarship will be paid to eligible new apprentices in trades with a skills shortage at the successful completion of each of their first and second years. That is a total of $1,000 for each new apprentice. This initiative will assist up to 60,000 first- and second-year apprentices every year, at a cost of $75 million over three years.The government will also provide a new payment of $25 per week for apprentices in their third year who have moved away from their family home to take up or remain in a new apprenticeship. This initiative will help some 2,900 new apprentices each year and cost just an additional $5 million over three years. Furthermore, the government is extending eligibility for Youth Allowance and Austudy to over-25s to new apprentices from 1 July this year, benefiting up to 75,000 new apprentices in 2005-06. It will be up to 93,000 new apprentices by 2008-09. It is a great story. You could talk about it all day, but the member for Gippsland does not want me to. For a cost of $410 million over three years, it shows that this government is committed to getting on with the job.</DOC>

 - I will take that question. I will take the question because the very first question that was asked of the minister by the Leader of the Opposition was based on a wrong statement. The Leader of the Opposition asserted in his question that the member for Dobell had announced details of the first Regional Partnerships grant of $748,000 on 8 June 2004, which was 16 days before an application was lodged and more than 24 hours before Wyong Shire Council even met to consider lodging an application. The truth is that he did not announce it on 8 June; he announced it on 1 July, which was after the approval given by the minister, the then parliamentary secretary. That is apparent from a perusal of the press statements that were made. I have in my hand a press statement from the indefatigable member for Dobell - the indefatigable and justly re-elected member for Dobell - dated 1 July 2004, in which he announces:The member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, has secured $680,000 in Australian government funds towards dredging Tumbi Creek. The funding was approved under the Australian government's Regional Partnerships program.If the Leader of the Opposition wants to mount a serious examination on this issue, he should not rely on the newspaper report that he flashed in front of me when the question was asked; he ought to rely on the original source material. Indeed, there was a statement made by the indefatigable member for Dobell on 8 June and in that statement he said this:The member for Dobell, Ken Ticehurst, is seeking to increase the offer of federal funding towards Tumbi Creek.In other words, what Ken Ticehurst was doing, what he was elected to do, was looking after his constituents. The bottom line of all of this is that in the last couple of days the member for Dobell and the minister have been attacked. Do you know why they have been attacked, Mr Speaker? They have been attacked because they have been looking after the people of the Central Coast of New South Wales. The reasons these two men are back in this House with increased majorities is that they understand the needs of the people of the Central Coast of New South Wales, whereas this reborn Leader of the Opposition does not even go to his source material, works himself up into a lather and completely misses the point.

 - Can I start by thanking the member for Herbert for a great question. His is a great demonstration of the way in which we have another successful program from the Howard government. They scream from the opposition benches because they detest Work for the Dole, despite the fact that this program works so well in their electorates as well. I am today after an indication from the opposition of who would be a champion of Work for the Dole on the other side, because to date there have been about 327 positions taken by members opposite on Work for the Dole - they are for it, they are against it, they are in favour, they are against. What you need to recognise is that Work for the Dole is a program that has worked incredibly successfully. If we look at the reason why unemployment in this country is at a 28-year low, why it is at 5.1 per cent, Work for the Dole is one of the programs that has contributed to that success. When we consider some of the programs that have been a success, the member for Herbert has a great example in his electorate. I refer to a letter that he received from the North Queensland Military Museum about a fantastic project in his own electorate that he championed. The people wanted me to table this letter today, because it is a fine demonstration of the way in which Work for the Dole has worked in Herbert. I table that letter in support of the Work for the Dole program. It is a great program that to date this financial year has provided about 43,000 Work for the Dole commencements. That is a 13 per cent increase over the same time last year. I say to the Labor Party today: please support Work for the Dole. It is a great program. It supports young Australians. If you are serious about supporting the government's employment programs, get behind Work for the Dole.</DOC>

 - Yes, I have seen the statement. Let me say this to the House: there is immense sympathy in the community and in the ranks of the government regarding Ms Rau. That sympathy and that compassion has been expressed in different ways by various members of the government, including the minister, myself and the Treasurer. It is the government's view that the appropriate time to consider an apology is after we have Mr Palmer's report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. I can confirm that on 25 January I directed that Mr Habib's passport be cancelled and instructed that a replacement passport should not be issued to him. Under the Passports Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the general authority to cancel an Australian passport. Section 8 of the act sets out specific circumstances that would justify cancellation of a passport, including where a person to whom a passport has been issued was likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country.The decision I took was based on an adverse ASIO security assessment of Mr Habib and ASIO's recommendation that I cancel the passport. I think it was a wise thing for me to act on the information I had been provided by ASIO. Over the last 12 months, under this authority I have cancelled 16 passports on the basis of adverse security assessments by ASIO. Of course, it is the right of any citizen, if their passport has been cancelled, to appeal my decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but let me just say this: I do not take the decision to cancel passports lightly. I value highly the right of all Australian citizens to freedom of movement but, when faced with a recommendation from ASIO that Mr Habib's travel overseas would represent a security risk, this was the only responsible action for me to take. I might add -   - I am indeed mindful of that point. Just for the information of the House, the opposition have been briefed on the reasons for the cancellation of Mr Habib's passport.</DOC>

 - I would have to check the exact date when those claims first came to the government. I am happy to do that. But, obviously, I do recall - if memory serves me correctly - that on one occasion Mr Habib himself complained to our consular officers about having been mistreated, and that was in Guantanamo Bay. I make this point: of course the Australian government would always follow up claims of Australian citizens being abused. In the case of Mr Habib, we asked the United States administration to establish an investigation into claims that he had been abused. Whether they were by him personally or by his lawyer, I do not immediately recall but, as a result of claims by both Hicks and Habib of having been abused, we asked the Americans to establish an inquiry. The Americans established an inquiry by the Department of Defense and found that, at least in Guantanamo Bay, they had not been abused. Nevertheless, the Americans established a further inquiry to look into allegations that they might have been abused at some point in American custody. That inquiry is not yet complete, although a preliminary assessment has been produced which suggests that neither Hicks nor Habib was abused in American custody. I qualify those remarks by saying we are still awaiting their final report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I acknowledge his interest in this issue as the member representing Olympic Dam, that wonderful area of resources in Australia.On Friday the government announced that, subject to Xstrata complying with a number of conditions, it would take no objection to its proposed acquisition offer made to shareholders of Western Mining. The conditions that the corporation will be required to comply with relate to the mining and export of uranium from Australia; the headquarters and executive boards of various divisions of the company; exploration requirements and disclosure requirements; and consultations on terms of marketing arrangements, which Xstrata may enter into with third parties. In addition, the government received some other assurances from the chief executive of Xstrata. Let me make it clear that this means that Western Mining shareholders will have the right to determine their own attitude to this offer. It is not the government's position to sell those shares. The shareholders have a property right. It is up to them as to whether or not they wish to sell their shares. All that has happened is that the government has, subject to those conditions, left the shareholders the freedom to deal with their own property.Let me also make it clear that the government has very, very rigorous controls in place in relation to the mining, transportation, export and sale of uranium in this country. Permits need to be granted to mine uranium. Environmental permits must be granted in order to hold or transport it. In order to take it out of the country, an export permit is required from the federal government. In order to sell it to a foreign country, it has to be approved, and the federal government must enter into an agreement with that foreign country. The contracts to sell must be provided to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. If any of those matters are struck down then the mining and sale of uranium will not go ahead.These controls would stay in place whether the owner was Western Mining or Xstrata, and they give the government full ability to control the exploitation, transportation, export and sale of any uranium from Australia. As I said, the government believes that putting these conditions in place ensures that this precious resource will be protected.I also indicate that there has been some criticism, in particular from the Democrats and the Greens, that this may lead to further mining of uranium. From the government's point of view, the further exploitation and sale of that uranium in accordance with our controls would be a good thing for Australia. It would actually be a good thing; it would boost our exports. The government would be far more concerned if the resource were underdeveloped than if it were developed. A threat that it might actually be developed was no part of our thinking in relation to this. Given all of those matters, this matter will go to the shareholders and the shareholders will determine the outcome of the current bid.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gellibrand for her question. Firstly, let me make it very clear that the government condemns torture. We do not condone it in any way whatsoever. We believe that, were material obtained by way of torture, its use for any other purpose, particularly in the justice system, would be compromised. The way in which it can be compromised varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. But, in Australia, if evidence were obtained by torture, it would be tainted and be unable to be used in any proceedings. In some other jurisdictions its probative value - that is, its usefulness - if brought into question is obviously a factor that people have to have in mind. In other words, it is highly unlikely that any evidence obtained by torture would be seen as having sufficient probative value to be useful. The reason that the United States determined not to proceed with any prosecution before a military commission is not known to me. All I know is that we were advised early this year that the United States did not intend to prosecute Mr Habib before the military commission, and for that reason we sought his return to Australia. We had always made it clear that, if they were not intending to prosecute an Australian, the Australian should be returned.Finally, on the evidence available to us - and this matter has been very closely examined - Mr Habib would not be able to be prosecuted for any offence under our laws in relation to conduct that occurred before 2002. The honourable member would be aware that, because of amendments to our Criminal Code introducing a range of terrorist offences, the matters that I have adverted to - that is, information that suggests that Mr Habib was in Afghanistan and advice from third parties, who were in both Pakistan and Afghanistan and who trained with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Al-Qaeda, that Mr Habib was there at the same time - were matters of very considerable concern to us. But, because all of that relates to the period before July 2002, advice given to us is that he could not be prosecuted in Australia. If other evidence came to light, leading to suggest that offences had been committed that are offences under our law, we would obviously pursue that.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I know that she, as much as any member of this House, is a great champion of freedom, including in Iraq. -  - I know freedom is just a bit of a joke for the Labor Party. Socialists do not much like freedom. I remember you lot when you were students - the Socialist Alliance and all that stuff. We remember. -  - Yes, and he saw the light and changed! The trouble is you have not changed. - The Iraq Electoral Commission announced the provisional results of the Iraqi election overnight. Around 60 per cent of people - that is around 8½ million Iraqis - voted in the elections. We now know that the mainly Shia grouping, the United Iraqi Alliance, gained 48 per cent of the vote, the Kurdish alliance took 26 per cent and interim Prime Minister Allawi's Iraqi List gained 14 per cent of the vote. Other groups are likely to be represented in the transitional national assembly: some of the Sunni groups, a Turkmen party, a Labor alliance, a group of Assyrian Christians and even some communists.The results, of course, are provisional until the completion of the complaints period, but the great winners from these elections are the Iraqi people. They are the great winners. It is an enormous step for Iraq after 50 years to be able to have an election and for the ordinary people of Iraq to be able to go out and vote. And the fact that they did so in the teeth of so much intimidation and violence is, I think, a remarkable thing. The Shia and the Kurdish representatives have wisely acknowledged the need to reach out to others, in particular the Sunnis, in the process of forming a government. We would very much encourage them to do so, because it is important that the mechanics of democracy work. The election, as I have said, was an enormous achievement, but the rights of minorities in all democracies need to be appropriately represented. All I can say is that these results underscore the fact that now is the time to fully support and underpin this emerging democracy. This is not the time to give up. It is not the time to cut and run. It is the time to show our faith in what we believe in - democracy and freedom - and apply those principles to Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for that question. My attention has been drawn to those reports and I was very concerned to read them. I hope that Telstra responds to a suggestion from the government that it might reconsider its position. There are many worthy causes in our nation, but a particularly worthy cause is Lifeline. It is a great organisation that was established more than 40 years ago by the late Reverend Sir Alan Walker. I think the technique of providing telephone counselling for people who are feeling disturbed or depressed was a world's first. It has not only spread throughout Australia but it has spread around the world.I do not speak as a leader of a government that has been an idle bystander on this issue. In the budget last year, the government provided $10 million to assist with the refurbishment and the upgrade of Lifeline's telephone and computer systems. At the same time, we provided $2 million to the Kids Help Line, run by the De La Salle Brothers, to allow that service to recruit and train more volunteers and maintain infrastructure. Prior to that budget announcement, the government had provided over $7 million in other grants to support the work of Lifeline.I have no doubt that Lifeline over the years has saved countless thousands of lives through the counselling that it has provided. I do hope that Telstra, which is experiencing very good times - I might say it is something of a tick to its retiring chief executive, Mr Switkowski - might take pause and reconsider its decision.</DOC>

 - I will give the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition the benefit of the doubt in terms of her ignorance of university funding. The first thing is that the University of Newcastle has $755 million in assets. It currently has no borrowings at all. Over the last four years it has had, respectively, a $13.8 million, a $5.6 million, a $3.8 million and a $3.8 million deficit which it has posted. It currently has $62 million in cash and liquid assets. The university as a consequence of this government's reforms - which the Labor Party opposed, the House should be reminded - receives an additional $16 million, in addition to its total $270 million a year in revenue, over the next three years. Whilst the university actually had 7½ per cent of all of the university places in New South Wales, it received 13½ per cent of the new allocations of places, which is 1,266.Inherent in the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is ignorance of the financial management act, which actually requires the universities not to report in one calendar year as revenue that which is intended for the following year. So of the $28 million which has been posted in terms of a deficit, $13 million actually relates to the fact that it can no longer report as 2004 revenue that which is delivered for and intended for 2005. The House ought to be aware that $8 million of the remaining $15 million in deficit relates to the fact that the university has not made provision for its ongoing liabilities.I would also say to the Labor Party: when an institution has a problem managing its resources it might actually relate to the way in which the university is being governed and administered. The solution to the problems that face Australian higher education is not simply to reach into the pockets of the everyday working Australian and say, `Gimme more!' The reality is that the new vice chancellor, Professor Nick Saunders, at Newcastle university is a man who will turn that institution around. The problems that face Newcastle university relate in every possible way to the crippling way in which that university and others are being administered across Australia. I look forward to support from the opposition in reforming Australia's university governance arrangements.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for his question and I can inform him and other members that the Howard government's extra investment in Medicare is delivering more affordable health services to the people of Australia. On 1 February last year the government introduced a $5 bulk-billing incentive payment for concession card holders and children under 16. Subsequently, this was increased to $7.50 in rural areas and many outer metropolitan areas. I can inform the House that in the December quarter the national GP bulk-billing rate was 72.4 per cent. This is a 5.9 per cent increase over 12 months. I am sure that the questioner will be pleased to know that in McMillan the GP bulk-billing rate has increased over 12 months from 53 per cent to 68 per cent thanks to the policies of the Howard government. Also in the December quarter the GP bulk-billing rate for people over 65 was 82.7 per cent, an 8.7 per cent increase over the last 12 months. Bulk-billing is important and it should be widely available. But it is unrealistic to expect everyone to be bulk-billed for everything all the time. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government I can report that the average copayment for GP patients not bulk-billed has fallen in the December quarter by 3.6 per cent. All of this demonstrates that our great Medicare system is in safe hands with the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As he would be aware, under the Repatriation Medical Authority there are statements of principles. These are transparent, scientific medical statements which relate all diseases to their causal link. This is not subject to any outside political decision making; it is a totally separate process. It has been respected by the veteran community and, might I add, it was introduced by the Labor Party under the minister at the time, Mr Sciacca. We respect the statement of principles and the Repatriation Medical Authority and the way in which they assess whether a veteran has died as a result of service related injuries or causes, or whether that is not the case. That is a system that is widely respected. It was introduced by the Labor Party and is regarded very highly by the ex-service organisations. It is certainly one that we have regard for, as we do for all aspects of our veterans and war widows entitlements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. All members of the House would be well aware that Japan is our largest export market. In the latest figures, exports worth $23.1 billion went from Australia to Japan. Interestingly, that has risen from $19 billion in 1996 to where it stands today. In 2004 Australia supplied 91 per cent of the beef that was imported into Japan from across the world - an amazing feat. I know that the member for Page and his electorate on the north coast of New South Wales have made an important contribution to that effort.The relationship between Australia and Japan is a very historic one going back to the fifties when Black Jack McEwen signed the commerce agreement with Japan in 1957. In 2003 the relationship was enhanced further when Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Koizumi signed a trade and economic framework. That laid down a new set of guidelines in terms of the way trade is done between the two countries. Today almost 80 per cent of Australian exports to Japan enter duty free and 87 per cent have duties of less than 10 per cent. We have certainly been encouraged by the support of enhancing the relationship through organisations and arrangements like the Australia-Japan conference. The third conference was held in Melbourne at the end of last week between Australia and Japan, with representatives of the Australian business community and representatives from all sides of politics. Interestingly, the joint communique that came out of that conference on Friday and over the weekend has called for a feasibility study into an Australia-Japan free trade agreement. I quote from the communique which states: `Sensitive sectors are perceived as a challenge on the Japanese side in particular, but there is momentum in Japan in reform and a demonstrated willingness to include such sectors in ongoing FTA negotiations in order to achieve economy-wide benefits.'There has been a bit of commentary over the weekend, but we would argue that an FTA is not unrealistic and could bring significant economic benefits by strengthening links with the second largest economy in the world. One thing that the opposition needs to understand is that we in Australia do have an ability to negotiate both inside the WTO and outside bilaterally at the same time. We have proven that we have been able to successfully do that. As our ties continue to develop and strengthen with others in the Asia-Pacific region, we have to maintain an ambitious stance with Japan and continue to be prepared, as always, to improve and strengthen the relationship with our major export market.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and acknowledge his ongoing concern to improve the job prospects of Indigenous people, particularly in the electorate of Kalgoorlie, which covers so much of Western Australia. At the centre of the government's programs for Indigenous employment is the CDEP, the Community Development Employment Program, which involves some 240 Indigenous organisations and provides over 37,000 participant places. Over the past six or seven months, since this program was moved into my portfolio, my department has been undertaking a comprehensive program of face-to-face consultations with Indigenous communities to consider improvements to the CDEP. A number of Indigenous communities during the course of this consultation have expressed a view that they could be getting better results from the CDEP. The result is that the government have listened to these concerns and we plan to implement some changes to the program in 2005-06. These changes are focused on building stronger links between CDEP activities and local community needs and also building closer links between the CDEP and other employment and business services. In this context may I briefly refer to an article that appeared on the front page of the Australian today suggesting in part that the government would be taking away job opportunities from CDEP participants by shifting responsibility for certain programs to other government instrumentalities. I assure the House that the government are committed to maintaining our funding for CDEP work of this kind. It is valuable work; it has clear benefit to local communities. In fact, it is an essential source of work for so many people in Indigenous communities. We are committed to maintaining and improving CDEP work for Indigenous Australians but we will not be putting jobs at risk.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Plainly we have had signalled to us, loudly and clearly, that this matter that has been canvassed in the House at some length would be pursued here, so I am glad of the opportunity to make some comments. I would begin by saying that the criteria for Invest Australia to consider went to a number of matters, but they did not include structural adjustment and, for that matter, regional development, and the successful -  -  - Well, you asked about criteria; I can confirm that much. I can tell you something else, and that is this: the Gunnedah project is a very major proposal, and the proponents have been quite open in acknowledging that they have taken and are taking a considerable amount of time to arrange offset agreements - in other words, purchasing agreements. In no small part that is thanks to the scare campaign that the Labor Party have mounted in this place, where they have continually charged, and never retracted in the face of the evidence, that motorists in Sydney had their engines damaged by the use of ethanol in their fuel. The member for Fraser has never apologised for that claim. He nods his head; he still will not.I want to make a couple of points about this before we go any further. I understand full well that it is the Leader of the Opposition's job to pursue these sorts of matters. There is more than a whiff of hypocrisy about it all. It is very much: `These grants are all terrible, they are all shocking, they are rotten to the core,' they are this, they are that, they are the other - unless they happen to be in Brand, when you support them very strongly, including in written support to me. But I want to come to the matter of Primary Energy's Gunnedah biorefinery.  -  - They are apparently not interested in getting to the heart of the issue. Just before I came in here a letter was sent through to Mr Beazley, with a copy forwarded to my office. It is written by Ian Kiernan AO, the Chairman of Primary Energy and also of Clean Up Australia. He said:... I wish to express my concerns in writing over the proposed handling of our project scheduled for todays sitting of Parliament.This is a Renewable Energy project pieced together by country Australians for the benefit of the Regional community in Australia at large. It has taken in excess of 3 years of hard work and considerable expense to bring the project to this final stage in the planning process ... -  - If you are going to drag people's names through the dirt, you might at least hear from those people. I say that to the Leader of the Opposition. It is obvious that every time you raise this without getting to the bottom of the facts -  - The Leader of the Opposition's proposition is patently absurd. He is going to drag everyone he can through the mud on this. He does not mind about the cost. He never sends anyone from that side out to rural and regional Australia to understand the pressures that are faced out there. - Who are they? Where are they? Who has been to the Namoi Valley to have a look at it? I will tell you who has, to his great credit: your New South Wales minister Craig Knowles has been out there. He knows how serious it is. But let me finish:It is taken in excess of 3 years of hard work and considerable expense to bring the project to the final stage in the planning process that should see Primary Energy breaking ground in the next 6-7 months - this major project is scheduled to go ahead - The availability of the ... funding came to the project at a crucial time when support was drastically needed to meet the high expenditure involved to bring the project to Financial Closure in the Gunnedah region. With the availability of this funding Primary Energy have been able to make strong commercial progress, that otherwise would have proved difficult. - So you do not want to hear from Ian Kiernan? He says:Remember this is a project being prepared by ordinary country Australians not Multi-nationals with deep pockets.And here is the critical bit -  - He has every right to be a critic - that is his job - but why doesn't he seek to be an informed critic? This is the point that Ian Kiernan now comes to in his letter to the Leader of the Opposition:We would ask you prior to further misunderstandings developing to accept an invitation to visit Gunnedah and meet with myself, Primary Energy and the Gunnedah Shire Council and see just how important this project is to the region, and to understand the affects to our region of the groundwater cutbacks and the devastating Socio-economic affects this will have on the region.He says this project offers:	Project Capital expenditure $100m 	Annual Operations expenditure $81m	Expansion of the local economic base $170m	Generation of an additional $30m in household income per year	Farmer sustainability, Additional grain markets	$47m Export Income	$88m Domestic Revenue	40 permanent employment positions	500 construction positions	350 permanent regional employment positions ...And the letter goes on. So I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: there is nothing I would like more than for the Leader of the Opposition, with his environment spokesman and anyone he wants to bring from the gallery, to come up and find out about this first hand so that he knows what he is talking about.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Her electorate is a great demonstration of the way this government has been able to reduce unemployment in this country. It is no surprise to members in this House that, since 1996, in Jackie Kelly's electorate the unemployment rate has fallen from 7.3 per cent to 5.1 per cent, which is a demonstration of the way that the member for Lindsay is working hard on the ground in her own electorate.Earlier I was able to announce the outcomes of the latest round of star ratings, which give a good indication of the way Job Network members across the nation are performing. It is an incredible success story in so many regions. I take the opportunity to congratulate each of the Job Network members who have contributed to life changes for many Australians who have been able to find and remain in employment. This government is very proud of the fact that over the last 12 months we have been able to place 169,000 long-term unemployed people, an increase of 100 per cent on the previous 12 months. It is no surprise that this government's employment policy has also resulted in about 630,000 job placements in 2004, a 51 per cent increase. This government remains committed to the employment policies we have in place. The unemployment rate stands in stark contrast to the 10.9 per cent unemployment rate when the Leader of the Opposition was employment services minister. We remain committed to helping Australians who are able to work to find a job.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the shadow minister. Obviously, the shadow minister was not paying attention in December when at the dispatch box I answered three questions in a row from the then Leader of the Opposition in relation to this project. I answered very comprehensively, detailing the exact process through which Primary Energy was approved. This project, as detailed by the Deputy Prime Minister, is an important project for rural Australia.  - It will provide something like a $170 million expansion to the economy, 50 permanent jobs and more than 500 jobs during the construction period. It was recommended by the New England ACC and the Namoi Valley structural package committee, and it met the strategic opportunity guidelines and the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package guidelines. At all times, the guidelines were followed, and I was pleased to approve that project.Whilst I am on my feet talking about Regional Partnerships, I have to say that the hypocrisy in this whole issue has been absolutely breathtaking. The Leader of the Opposition has made a sustained attack on the government and on me - a failed attack - and has made some very serious allegations about my propriety. I would like to take the time to detail some of the Regional Partnerships projects approved in the electorate of Lingiari in 2004. - Obviously, the opposition are not interested in Regional Partnerships. Regional Partnerships is a program that delivers real benefits to real communities throughout Australia. It is a program I am proud of and fully support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. I know the understanding he has of aged care in his electorate from my numerous visits to his electorate over the last few months. I am pleased to report that 22 of the 31 measures contained in the government's $2.2 billion aged care package have been finalised and implemented in full. We are continuing to consult widely with the aged care sector, residents and families to ensure that the remaining nine measures can be implemented shortly. The budget measures mean that the amount invested in aged care by this government since it came to office in 1996 will be over $67 billion by 2008.There are two key initiatives which will come into effect from 1 July, including the Transition Care Program, which encompasses 2,000 new transition care places for older Australians who have been in hospital and who are seeking time before returning to residential care or back home to the community. These places will ensure that older Australians receive appropriate care in appropriate settings. The program will better integrate hospital and aged care services and will ensure that older Australians receive extra rehabilitation and support after a stay in hospital.The second key initiative is the transfer of assets testing. Under the previous arrangements, providers assessed the assets of residents or prospective residents for entry into residential care. This process will now be transferred to Centrelink and, in the case of veterans, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will ensure continuity, accuracy and consistency in the assessment of aged care residents' assets. These two initiatives add to the many initiatives that arose from the government's $2.2 billion response to the Hogan review, which included the conditional adjustment payment, an extra $877 million for payment to aged care providers; the $513 million one-off capital payment that was made to aged care providers for fire and safety requirements; the viability supplement; an extra $13 million over four years to rural and regional providers; and, importantly, the $101 million package for aged care workforce training to ensure that we can attract and retain good, professional, dedicated aged care staff. This government is putting in place policies and resources to ensure that we have a sustainable, viable aged care sector to meet the needs of our ageing population.</DOC>

 - The outbreak of citrus canker on two properties in the Emerald area has had a very serious impact on the community of Emerald. While they are a relatively small number of growers they are large scale producers and employ a very large number of people. The fact that they have been unable to sell their product in other parts of Australia or in other countries that are citrus canker free has certainly had a very serious economic effect on the people of that region. I would like to commend the member for Maranoa for the diligent way in which he has represented the concerns of that region to ensure that an eradication program has been put in place so that as quickly as possible the production in that region can return to normal, and also for the way in which he has effectively lobbied for assistance for the producers in that area through these difficult times.Last week the federal government announced a package of assistance measures to these producers and other citrus producers in Queensland who are facing the effects of the citrus canker outbreak or the impact of the measures put in place to prevent its spread. There will be grants of up to $100,000 a year for two years to help farmers with their interest payments. There will be up to 24 months of fortnightly assistance to assist them with meeting the basic needs of their families. We have also indicated a willingness to help support the industry in putting a facilitator in place to help to open up markets, especially for the product coming from the quarantine area. The eradication of citrus canker in that region is fundamentally the responsibility of the Queensland government and is occurring under their law but it is the citrus producing states and the Commonwealth which are meeting the costs of that operation. The Commonwealth meets over half the costs - currently about $5½ million. Queensland's share is only about eight per cent of the total cost of the eradication program so it has been disappointing that the Queensland government has been unwilling to provide real, meaningful assistance to the producers in this area. Once again we have a state Labor government walking away from farmers in need, offering them more loans and more debt but no real practical support. It is very disappointing. The people of Emerald expressed that view loudly and clearly at public meetings last week. The federal government is prepared to help to work with the industry to get them through these tough times. Now it is time for the Queensland government to do its share.</DOC>

It was entirely as the member for Griffith should have acknowledged in his question in the context of the Abu Ghraib allegations. The member for Griffith knew that and the member for Griffith should have been a little more candid with the parliament in asking the question. As to matters concerning the defence minister, those questions are best directed to him, and he and his colleagues will of course -  - He and his officials will be available at the Senate estimates committee tomorrow.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I just want to add my condolences to Peter White's widow and family. He was a very fine member of the House of Representatives, a very good man. On this side of the House we warmly welcome the elections in Iraq. I note, in answer to the honourable member's question, that the warmth of the welcome for the results of those elections by the government - by the coalition members of the House of Representatives - has been reflected in the mainstream of the international community. That redoubtable Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, called the elections 'moving and humbling'. The New Zealand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said that they were 'a key step towards achieving a democratic and peaceful Iraq'. The South Korean foreign minister - from our own region - highly praised and celebrated Iraq's elections. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosoda said it was significant. As for the Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman, and I have been asked before about Indonesia's approach to changes in Iraq, he described the elections as a 'commendable determination' by the Iraqi people to seize their own destiny.There is no doubt about it: the international community, including, very importantly, Iraq's neighbours, have been delighted with the progress of the elections and the advent of democracy in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said it was a good example of a democratic process, and he praised the democratic processes in both Iraq and the Palestinian territories. Even the Iranian regime recognised the vote as a great step for Iraqis towards an independent regime. It is not surprising that there are still a number of countries - at the moment, 28 - with troops on the ground in Iraq, a number that the opposition spokesman on defence found surprising when he did an interview the other day but, if you follow these issues, you will find there is a lot more to them than meets the eye. The 28 countries there on the ground are making a valuable contribution.Finally, let me just say that I regret the opposition is less enthusiastic about the elections, has less to say about the elections and has fewer positive remarks to make about the elections. Instead we have just had lectures from the opposition about how awful the prospects for Iraq are. For example, we had the famous 106-word sentence from the Leader of the Opposition. -  - Yes, you may moan. They are moaning now, Mr Speaker. To put that into some perspective, I checked. The Gettysburg Address was reputedly 244 words, so 106 is not even quite half the length of the Gettysburg Address - but it was just one sentence.</DOC>

 - What I said was that those are questions that should be best directed to the defence minister, and the reason they should be directed to the defence minister is that they concern and are based upon remarks that have been made overnight by Mr Barton, who was at some point an officer in the defence forces and - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  -  - The coalition not only does well with the over 60s but with the very young as well! But these questions arise from some remarks that have been made by Mr Barton. They concern claims that he has made in relation to communications that he has made to the defence department. I think the best and most appropriate way in which they can and will be responded to is by questions being directed to the defence minister and to his officials, and that is what will happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson very much for the question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released lending finance figures today showing that, in relation to housing finance, there was a bit of a tick up at the end of last year. Members of the House will recall that I have been dwelling on the fact that housing finance had turned down, which was something the government actually welcomed, in the course of the year. It does appear that there was a bit of a tick up at the end of the last year. Whether or not that presages something more permanent or it is just a change in relation to those months, we will have to wait and see. However, personal finance, although it increased in the month of December, is down over the year by 5.3 per cent. This is consistent with what we believe to be indications that households are consolidating their balance sheets and saving more than in the past. If so, that is very much a welcome thing.The St George-ACCI Business Expectations Survey was released today, and it shows that expectations for the Australian economy are good; 2005 is expected to be buoyant and, importantly, expectations for wages growth over the next year have moderated. This is a point I have been making on numbers of occasions. We have historically low unemployment at the moment, over the last 30 years in Australia. If that should work its way into wage claims which are not based on productivity, that would be a key risk for the Australian economy. I would say to employees that there is an opportunity for good job opportunities and there is an opportunity for real wage increases, but we can only do that in a productive economy.St George and ACCI point to robust employment growth expectations in the next year. On this side of the House, we believe that there is nothing more important in economic policy than delivering job opportunities to young Australians. Over the course of the government's period since 1996, in Australia there have been created 1.5 million new jobs. That is 1.5 million Australians who have had an opportunity that they would not have had if we had not had that growth in the economy and that job opportunity. The task of economic policy is to keep on going in this country to give more young Australians better opportunity in a growing economy.</DOC>

 - I have been asked two questions which have been based on claims made by somebody who was an officer in the defence forces. I repeat - as the Leader of the Opposition, both as a former Minister for Defence and otherwise, will know - that answers in relation to matters of detail like that are based on advice from Defence. There will be ample opportunity tomorrow for the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence to answer those questions. The only thing I would add is to assure the member for Barton that I am not in any way acknowledging that Australians were involved in the interrogation of prisoners.I repeat what has previously been said in this parliament: we accept in the early stages after 2003 that we were not an occupying power and Australia did not accept or detain prisoners. As I understand it, Mr Barton was involved at the time in doing work by the Iraq Survey Group. He was not involved as an officer of the Defence Force in ordinary defence work.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. The member asks sensible questions on important issues for Australia and for the Asia-Pacific region. As the House is aware, the North Korean foreign ministry issued a statement on 10 February claiming that it had indefinitely suspended participation in what are called the six-party talks on its nuclear weapons programs and - to use its words - that it had manufactured nukes for self-defence. Our first reaction to that statement was that it was important not to overreact. Over the years we have been pretty used to the rhetoric of the North Korean regime, and there is no reason for us to react too strongly to that kind of rhetoric. The important thing for Australia and for the region is to do what we can to ensure that the six-party talks process does work.I spoke last Friday to Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. Amongst other topics we discussed this issue. We certainly, and not surprisingly, warmly agreed with each other on the need to try to get the six-party talks going again. I spoke with the North Korean ambassador. I rang him, as I was in Adelaide and he was in Canberra, and I made it clear to him that we wanted to see North Korea return to the six-party process, that there was not a viable alternative for North Korea. If North Korea want some kind of a security guarantee, they will get that security guarantee from the other five parties to the six-party talks process by following through on the six-party talks. I made it clear to him that if they want to see economic development in North Korea - and from my experience there they certainly need it - a successful outcome to the six-party process would give North Korea the best opportunity to do that.I also spoke with the Chinese ambassador, who used to be the Chinese negotiator in the six-party process - and many members here will know Fu Ying - and I made it clear to her that we appreciated what China had been doing and that we hoped China would redouble its efforts to get the six-party talks going again. The North Koreans, not surprisingly, have come out and said that they would like to have bilateral negotiations just with the United States. Let it be said that Australia stands firmly by the view that the best way forward is through the six-party process, not through trying to isolate countries like China, Japan, South Korea and Russia from the process. It is very important that all of those countries are involved in this negotiation, not just the United States. I hope very much that, as time goes on, the North Korean leadership will recognise the commonsense of this position - and we will continue to communicate it to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I was rather intrigued to read in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday that I had been challenged by the New South Wales housing minister, Mr Tripodi, to change Commonwealth superannuation rules. You become the New South Wales housing minister and you are suddenly a superannuation expert. Normally, when you get these challenges, somebody rings you up or you receive a letter from them. But, no, apparently you have to read the Sydney Morning Herald to find Mr Tripodi's challenges - and it was a very challenging one, if I may so. It did not seem to get much support:Assistant federal Treasurer Mal Brough said the proposal was 'ridiculous'...Always a man of few words, but good ones. The federal Labor spokesman on finance and superannuation said that the compounding impact of $25,000 out of your superannuation 'will be very significant by the time you hit your 50s and 60s.' That seems right to me. Also:The Investment and Financial Services Association chief executive Richard Gilbert said Mr Tripodi should 'stick to his knitting ...'I do not know what sort of a knitter he is, but he is a better knitter than he is a housing minister, that's for sure! - I know he is a good friend of the member for Grayndler. I want to get that onto the record: 'Member for Grayndler speaks up in favour of Joe Tripodi'. Nobody will believe it back in Sydney, unless they see it in the Hansard. 'At that point Labor frontbench joins with government in laughing at Mr Tripodi' probably should go into the Hansard. But I make this point: the New South Wales government has a new concern about the level of the property market in New South Wales. Can I say, the whole of the New South Wales government budget runs flush on the property market of New South Wales.In 1994, the New South Wales government collected $510 million in land tax. Ten years later, in 2003-04, from $510 million the land tax had gone up to $1,355 million. In relation to stamp duties in New South Wales, since the election of the Carr government, when stamp duty was $1.09 billion, today the New South Wales government is collecting $3.9 billion in stamp duties, and what is Mr Joe Tripodi's view? Mr Joe Tripodi says you should draw forward your retirement income and use your retirement income to try and pay some of your New South Wales tax bill.If he wants to do something for the people of New South Wales, let the New South Wales Labor government cut its taxes, and, in particular, the vendor tax. Not only do they tax you when you buy a property - not only do they tax you with land tax - they now tax you as you sell your property. We would say to the New South Wales government: if you want to make it easier for people to purchase an investment property, if you want to make it easier for young couples to rent in the New South Wales market, now is the time to get rid of that vendor tax. It was not a tax that you were honest about; it is a tax that is hurting the market. It ought to be gone, and the New South Wales government ought to get rid of it.</DOC>

 - I am certainly aware - and the member for New England, perhaps surprisingly, draws attention to it - of the strong personal commitment of the leader of The Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister to the ethanol industry. I want to applaud the efforts to bring sensible policy in this area that have been pursued by the Deputy Prime Minister. We have looked at mandating in the past and we have looked at it, I think, with quite an open mind. The advice that is available to the government at present is not sufficiently convincing to support mandating.Mandating of ethanol does involve, prima facie, a significant market distortion. What we are in effect saying is that you must, under penalty of law, use a certain product in a certain ratio. You have to have a very good reason before you do that. Given the fact that there are already significant tax inducements for the use of alternative fuels and given the fact that we have an ethanol program which is designed to help companies that are trying to use ethanol, you have to have a pretty convincing scientific case. We have looked at it. In a sense, the easy policy option - the lazy policy option - would be the one being advocated by the member for New England, because there is a lot of popular support for it. But, on the information that we have seen to date, that popular support is not soundly based.Let me say to the member for New England, as I say to everybody else in the House, that, if the scientific and other evidence coming before the government were to change, I would certainly be willing to change my mind and I am sure my colleagues would be willing to change their minds. We do not have any prejudice against ethanol. We do not have any prejudice against the people who are promoting it. We have not tried to destroy the ethanol industry, as members of the Labor Party did last year.One of the reasons why the member for New England asks this question is that there is a lot of distress amongst those people who are concerned about the future of the ethanol industry and of one company in particular, and the difficulties of those people and that company are the direct result of the political campaign that was waged in this parliament by members of the Australian Labor Party. They could not have cared less about the bush. They did not care less about the ethanol industry. They just wanted to try and get somebody on the grounds of some alleged over-close association with me. I have never denied the fact that I know and like Dick Honan. I do not run away from people I know - that is not my style. Quite frankly, that campaign has done great damage to the industry, and the Labor Party ought to be ashamed of the way in which they have played politics to the detriment of companies, investment and an industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his questions. Yesterday I was able to inform the House about more bulk-billing and today I am able to inform the House that more Australians are taking out private health insurance. In the December quarter 34,000 more Australians were covered by private health insurance, including 31,000 more Australians over the age 55. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government nearly nine million Australians now enjoy the added security that private health insurance brings, including -  -  - I am being distracted by this unaccustomed flattery. Nearly nine million Australians enjoy the added security that private health insurance brings, including one million Australians with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. For the benefit of members opposite I point out that having more people with private health insurance helps everyone because that takes the pressure off public hospital waiting lists. Fifty-six per cent of all surgery in this country now takes place in private hospitals. In recent years private hospital admissions have been growing by six per cent a year compared to just two per cent a year for public hospital admissions. Since 1996 the number of private hospital beds has increased by 12 per cent and in the same period the number of public hospital beds has fallen by seven per cent. The truth is that we cannot have a strong and dynamic Medicare system in this country without a strong and viable private health sector as well. These figures today demonstrate that you can trust the Howard government with the health care of the Australian people and you can trust the Howard government to take the steps necessary to make a good system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his questions and note his very real interest in the performance of the rail infrastructure in his area. There has been a bit of a focus in recent days on the capacity of our nation to meet export demands via its ports and related infrastructure. The Treasurer has rightly raised this matter. Here we have a good news story and a stark contrast between state performance in the management and upgrading of infrastructure and our performance.The Hunter Valley generates no less than 36 per cent of Australia's coal exports. Indeed, 2½ per cent of the world's shipping capacity has been involved in moving coal out of Newcastle in recent times. There have been real problems there in that the coal loader, which is perhaps one of the best in the world with a capacity of a bit over 100 million tonnes a year, has a rail feeder that has not been able to keep up with that demand. In September last year the Australian government through its wholly-owned corporation, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, took over control of the management of the interstate and Hunter Valley rail links in New South Wales. I was amazed to be told anecdotally by a couple of people who were looking to invest further in the coal industry that they had noticed in just four months a 20 per cent increase in productivity. I thought that that was only anecdotal, that it could not possibly be right.In fact it is right. Indeed, as a result of what the ARTC have been doing - and not a cent has been spent yet; we have $260-odd million of upgrades to come - just through improving track maintenance, workplace culture, the facilitation of improved rolling stock deployment by rail operators and so forth, they managed in one day, on 22 January this year, to move 280,000 tonnes of export coal - a record. It was 20 per cent up on the previous best performance, and I think that is something for which the Australian Rail Track Corporation and the people who work for it ought to be heartily congratulated. They are helping to create more jobs and a better export performance. They are highlighting what you can do with good management. Fifty-five coal services were managed on that network in just one day.When you stop to think of what is to come - the upgrade which will include a program for duplication of the track north of Maitland to reduce congestion; grade separation at Sandgate, which is long overdue; concrete resleepering; track straightening; and bridge strengthening - the sky is the limit. It just shows what can be achieved with good management, with a bit of dedication, with some good business analyses and the financial support necessary to back that up. The challenge is there now for the Queensland government, more than anybody else, to step up to the mark with its export ports and show us what it can do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question and acknowledge both his and his family's long involvement in small business in Australia. As the member for Stirling knows, the government has been undertaking a comprehensive consultation process in relation to further reform of workplace relations in Australia and has welcomed input from various individuals and organisations. To this end, I welcome the release today by the Business Council of Australia of their suggestions in a document entitled Workplace relations - the way forward. I remind honourable members that the companies that are affiliated with the Business Council of Australia directly employ some one million people in Australia. This report acknowledges that workplace reforms previously put in place have done a number of substantial things. Firstly, they have boosted the pace of productivity growth in Australia. Secondly, they have helped to cut unemployment in this country. Thirdly, they have encouraged higher participation in the work force. Fourthly, the reforms in particular of this government have reduced industrial disputation.What the Business Council of Australia goes on to suggest is a need for further evolution of workplace relations in Australia to ensure that we keep pace in this country with a dynamic modern economy. It supports, for example, moves to simplify awards which the Business Council describes as:... blunt instruments of employment with little scope to differentiate arrangements with individual employees in response to their roles, efforts and capabilities.The Business Council also supports streamlining the agreement-making process and addressing problems in what it calls the jurisdictional fault lines caused by the duplication of state and federal workplace systems. Indeed, Mr Michael Chaney from the Business Council said:The ongoing success of our economy - in particular its capacity to deliver higher living standards and strong incomes growth - depends on allowing Australian workplaces, large and small, to be as flexible, skilled, productive ... as possible.That is a good summary of the government's intention in relation to this matter. Anybody who has any grasp on the reality of what is needed for Australia's future prosperity will know that standing still is not an option and that we must continue to move forward in a way which will create greater prosperity and more jobs for Australians. That stands in stark contrast with the Labor Party that still has its policies rooted in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that for his constituents in Corangamite, China has always been a very important market, particularly for the wool that comes out of his electorate and for other products as well. As the House would be aware, in October 2003 China and Australia agreed, as a result of the signing of the economic framework, to undertake a joint feasibility study into the possibility of a free trade agreement between China and Australia. That has continued well, to the point where we expect that to be completed within the next month or so.For the information of the member for Corangamite, I read with interest recently comments by the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, at a symposium presumably being conducted by the ACTU called China, trade liberalisation and labour rights, which I note was closed to the public and the media although the speech was distributed. Ms Burrow made it clear that she has problems about the economic gains from the FTA and she was quoted as saying that she had significant reservations about the net economic gain from bilateral agreements. We know the position the ACTU and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party took on the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. But what Ms Burrow is, in effect, saying is that she has reservations about linking Australia more closely to our second largest merchandise export market, linking us more closely to a market where our trade has quadrupled over the last decade and linking us with a market whose GDP is forecast to grow by about seven to eight per cent per annum over the next 10 to 15 years.I can assure the House and the member for Corangamite that the ultimate decision on whether we proceed with an FTA or not will be based on the feasibility study. It will be based on an economic analysis and an overall assessment of the national interest, recognising the importance of this market. There are, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, a number of former presidents of the ACTU in this place. One of them was in the media today recognising the importance of the Chinese market with respect to a particular resource that we have in Australia. We welcome those comments from the member for Batman with regard to future trade prospects with China. We hope that the opposition, when they make their assessment of the prospective negotiations with China, base that on the same criteria as the government and not on whether it is in the interests of their political masters at the ACTU - an organisation that we know for very good reasons is representing a diminishing membership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I would also like to thank her for her very excellent chairing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and for its excellent report, Every picture tells a story. The committee's work formed the basis for the most significant changes announced to the family law system in some 30 years. Those reforms are about changing the culture in the way in which family law issues are addressed. We hope to achieve this by giving families facing difficulties a single entry point to access services that can help them. We will do that through 65 family relationship centres, the first 15 to be established initially and the rest within three years. We also do so by encouraging separating parents to work together to resolve their difficulties and to recognise that, rather than working against each other in a court room, they should try to work these issues out before they contemplate going to court. We want to change the Family Law Act to promote the sharing of parenting responsibilities and to recognise the right of a child to be able to know both their parents unless there are exceptional circumstances.These are good and practical reforms. I think they have been very well received by the community. I am reinforced in that by our recent consultations, which attracted more than 400 submissions. Most of them welcomed the government's efforts to make the family law system less adversarial and more focused on the best interests of children. I want to thank the community and the stakeholders for their overwhelming response to our discussion paper. When families separate it obviously touches the lives of many people in our community. This government is about reducing the pain and conflict for families post separation, and these reforms will go a long way to achieving that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question and acknowledge his keen interest in agricultural issues in Western Australia. There has been some return to better seasons in parts of Western Australia, resulting in some good wheat crops, but there are areas where the drought is persisting and where there is continuing difficulty for farmers in making a worthwhile living in those parts. I am pleased to advise the House that this morning I announced that three drought-affected shires in Western Australia's north-eastern wheat belt will now be able to receive interim exceptional circumstances assistance. The farmers in these areas have endured ongoing drought and difficult seasons for some time, and this will enable them to get six months of assistance to meet basic needs for their families while their applications for full exceptional circumstances assistance are under consideration by the National Rural Advisory Council. If that is successful then these benefits would continue for two years and interest subsidy payments would also be available to the farmers in those areas. Because this is a large-scale farming area where the properties have, in many instances, run up significant debts, those interest subsidies are of particular value.For at least four years now the federal government have been trying to reform the exceptional circumstances arrangements to make them work well, but we have had little or no cooperation from any of the states. I did notice that a week or two ago the Western Australian government announced some extra drought assistance in the form of some top-up grants for farmers in that state, and of course that is welcome. It is good to see a state introducing some new measures. But the farmers of Western Australia would be well advised, if they are thinking of voting Labor in the state election coming up, to look at the record of what Labor did in the eastern states in relation to drought assistance in the run-up to their state elections.The Victorian government introduced a very useful assistance program of grants for that state's farmers before the Victorian state election, but as soon as the election was over they axed it and there is now no assistance at all coming from the Victorian government to the state's farmers. In New South Wales and Queensland the Labor Party did similar things: they announced assistance to drought-stricken farmers but as soon as the elections were over they quietly started to withdraw the areas eligible for assistance. So the farmers in Western Australia need to keep a good eye on what is happening there as well. These announcements that come before elections, when they are made by the Labor Party, are inevitably followed up by a withdrawal of those measures as soon as the elections are over. The safest way to make sure that it does not happen is to throw out the Labor government in Western Australia and elect a government that will deliver meaningful assistance to the state's farmers.</DOC>

 - I think they are both splendid ministers and, of course, I agree with them both. They do their jobs extremely well. I take this opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about climate change, to reaffirm, for reasons I am sure will become apparent during question time, that the government does not believe it is in Australia's interest to sign the Kyoto protocol.</DOC>

 - The principal reason why Australia will not sign the Kyoto protocol is that it is not in Australia's interest to do so. We take decisions not based on ideology or prejudice; we take decisions that are based overwhelmingly on a consideration of the national interest. The reality is that the modalities surrounding the Kyoto protocol at present mean that, if Australia were to do what the Australian Labor Party wants Australia to do, we would create a situation where countries such as China, India and Indonesia would not be subject to the same penalties and restrictions as would Australia, and as a result we would run the risk of losing both industry and jobs to countries in that situation.Any but the most cursory examination of this issue will tell you that, until such time as the major polluters of the world, including the United States and China, are made part of the Kyoto regime, it is next to useless and, indeed, harmful for a country such as Australia to sign up to the Kyoto protocol. It is worth noting that as of now, on my advice, there are only four or five countries in the world that are on track to meet their Kyoto emission targets. One of those countries is Australia; others are New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Sweden - and Germany, I understand, is close.So, when it comes to performance as distinct from rhetoric and Valentine's Day or Christmas cards or anything else, Australia is doing as well as any other country in the world. Australia is on track to meet its emission targets. Australia will not become part of an arrangement that is going to potentially destroy jobs in this country. We are not going to be part of an arrangement that will see the export of industries from this country; but we will be part and we are part of an arrangement whereby, through our own domestic policies, we are able to reduce emissions and, indeed, to be performing as well as any other country in the world in meeting our targets.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of that newspaper item from last year, but I can say that, if you are asking me about the economic effects of the Kyoto protocol, I thoroughly agree with what the Prime Minister has just said. For Australia to ratify the Kyoto protocol in the absence of particularly countries from the developing world would just shift production from Australia to the developing world without any commensurate improvement in the environment and certainly with a very large detriment to the Australian economy. Given those considerations, I do not believe that there is an economic benefit in ratifying the current provisions of the Kyoto protocol.In addition to that, Australia has managed to take a completely responsible position in relation to greenhouse gases. As I heard the Prime Minister just say, we are one of the countries that has probably been more successful than others. We will play our part, but we will not be part of a one-sided agreement which would handicap the Australian economy. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. He is one of a number of members who has many friends in Lebanon and a particular interest in Lebanon. As members are aware, a massive car bomb killed Mr Hariri on 14 February. Apparently, 16 others were killed and around 100 people were injured in this incident. We extend our condolences to the families of the victims. Our ambassador in Beirut has expressed these condolences directly to Mr Hariri's family and will visit his family home as part of his funeral ceremony today.Mr Hariri will be remembered for his significant contribution to the reconstruction of Beirut following the civil war that took place in Lebanon. We had been hoping that he would visit Australia during this year, but unfortunately he had some difficulties with his schedule in the early part of the year. He was known to members on both sides of the House. The Attorney-General, when he was the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, met with Mr Hariri in Beirut in 2001. A parliamentary delegation to Lebanon met with him in 1993, and other members from the former Labor government and the present government met with him as well.As a result of this incident, we will be upgrading our travel advisory for Lebanon. Although there will be no change to the overall level of advice for Lebanon, we will be continuing to advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution. We have added:Such incidents - that is, political assassinations - can lead to retaliatory attacks or other violence. Bystanders can be caught up in these attacks.We deplore this act of senseless violence and terrorism. At this stage it is too early to be sure who is responsible for it, but the perpetrators - whoever they may be - must be identified and then they must be brought to justice. We strongly support Lebanese sovereignty, independence and national unity. As a matter of principle, we support the withdrawal from Lebanon of foreign troops - that is, of course, Syrian forces. We expect Syria to act in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution 1559, which calls for withdrawal of all foreign forces and the disbanding of militias.</DOC>

 - I thank my leader for the question. The major reason why this bill should be prioritised is the fact that the Kyoto protocol comes into effect today after being ratified by 140 countries, plus the European Union. Of industrialised countries, only Australia and the United States - and, to be accurate, also Lichtenstein and Monaco - are outside the agreement. - Whilst the rest of the industrialised world can celebrate, Australia can only lament this lost opportunity. The reason why my bill should be prioritised is that climate change is the No. 1 environmental challenge facing the global community. My bill should be prioritised because from today Australia will be restricted from the economic opportunities that arise in the global trading market. The Sydney Futures Exchange, to name just one, developed infrastructure in the financial year 1999-2000. They are in a position to have a trading platform, a registry function and a settlement service, but they have put this all on hold until Australia ratifies the protocol. The reason why my bill should be prioritised is that, until we do, Australia will not be able to benefit from clean development mechanism provisions contained in the protocol.  - These are designed to encourage renewable energy projects in developing countries, such as the natural gas project that Australia has with China. My bill should be prioritised because until it is, and until it is carried, renewable energy projects will continue to move offshore to countries which have ratified the protocol - such as Pacific Solar, based in Botany in the electorate of the member for Kingsford Smith, which has moved from Sydney to Germany, taking jobs with it.My bill should be prioritised because, as the Prime Minister says, we are on track to meet our Kyoto target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2012. The Prime Minister is right when he says the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, did a good job negotiating on Australia's behalf in Kyoto. He was right when he said in 1997 that the protocol was good for jobs and good for the environment. He was right then, but he is wrong now. My bill should be prioritised because Australia's ability to influence what happens in the post-Kyoto world, after 2012, is restricted because we will not be at the negotiating table. We are isolating ourselves from this new opportunity. - It is absolutely critical that my bill should be prioritised, because day after day in here we are discussing national security. Agreements such as the Kyoto protocol promote a common purpose. Climate change is the ultimate intergenerational issue. We should prioritise it for the sake not just of ourselves but of our children and grandchildren. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can sum up to the Prime Minister in two words why this bill should be prioritised and why it should be carried by this House: carpe diem - seize the day.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. - And I congratulate the member for Grayndler on giving certainly the most riveting speech to the House since Fidel Castro addressed the Cuban people for five hours in Havana on Independence Day - and if you listen to Fidel Castro too much you will become like him.The coal industry is one of Australia's most important industries. Coal is Australia's No. 1 export, earning the country $13 billion in 2004. The total proportion of Australia's export coal going out of Dalrymple Bay, off Mackay, is 25 per cent and the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal is one of the largest terminals in the world. Last week 42 bulk carriers were queuing off the coast at Dalrymple Bay and, according to the AM program this morning quoting the local hotel owner, 38 vessels are queued off Dalrymple Bay today. Here we have our No. 1 export, here we have our No. 1 port, here we have demand which is growing for Australia's export, here we have prices which are rising and yet we have 42 - or 38 or some such number of - vessels queuing to get into the port to take those exports off overseas. I was astounded when in the AM program this morning, as they interviewed the Queensland minister for ports on what the problem was at Dalrymple Bay, he said Canberra should come up with some assistance. He said:Not one red cent has been devoted by them to coal or rail or port infrastructure. On the other hand, the Queensland Government is spending a fortune when it comes to both ports and rail ...I would ask the House to bear with me. The relevant minister in Queensland said the Queensland government was `spending a fortune' on ports, so one must assume he is referring to Dalrymple Bay, which after all takes 25 per cent of our exports. I want to table in this House the true situation in relation to Dalrymple Bay. In the Queensland parliament on 22 June 2001, the Treasurer, Mr Terry Mackenroth, stood up to announce the terms on which the Queensland government gave out a 50-year lease on the Dalrymple Bay coal loader. The Commonwealth has never owned a port in Australia. The Queensland government up until 2001 owned the Dalrymple coal loader and in that year entered into a 50-year lease. He said in the Queensland parliament:... the lease will free up government capital in the terminal, ensuring the government can put taxpayers' money where it belongs - in schools, hospitals and roads.Listen to this:It will also relieve the government of the need to meet the terminal's future capital investment requirements of some $600 million over the next 10 to 15 years ...In other words, the Queensland government divested itself of this loader in order to get out of the capital investment that was required and along the way pocketed $630 million from the 50-year lease. - Now, after pocketing the $630 million, after walking away from the investment that was required, we have Paul Lucas on AM saying it is all Canberra's fault. - They must have a button they push up there in the Queensland government: `Whatever the problem is, it must be Canberra's fault.' This was a Queensland port. This was leased by the Queensland government. They took $630 million to do it and they did it so that they did not have to engage in capital investment. People in this House might well say that investment in schools and roads and hospitals is a good thing. Let me make this point: in 2004-05 the Queensland government will receive in GST revenue $7,314 million, including a windfall of $760 million out of the GST. From the Commonwealth government's point of view, we are not going to allow this important matter of Australia's infrastructure to wallow in incompetence. I have spoken to the minister for transport. We will be inviting the coal producers out of Queensland to come down to Canberra to speak to the Commonwealth government, to give the Commonwealth government advice on what it might do to try and bring the Queensland government to the party to clear that port and help Australia's export industry. </DOC>

Certainly, this is a government which believes in improving cancer care. During the election campaign, we announced a widely applauded cancer care policy that involved the commitment of $137 million more to cancer care over the next four years. As part of that, there was $2 million over four years to fund the kind of grant that the member opposite refers to. If there was any commitment made, it certainly will be kept.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and his interest in the ongoing reform of the building and construction industry. I know that he has in his electorate WestTrack, which is a major supplier of earthmoving equipment to the building and construction industry in Western Australia. This government remains committed to cleaning up the building industry. Indeed, we will re-introduce this year legislation in response to the Cole royal commission to implement the recommendations of that commission, having already implemented some 170 of the 212 recommendations of Justice Cole.A crucial part of this response has been the implementation of the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry. I am pleased that both the states of Victoria and South Australia have signed up to this code but disappointed that Western Australia, where the honourable member's electorate is, has still not signed up. I note that just last week the state opposition in Western Australia committed to signing up to the code of practice, should it be elected to government. I once again call on Premier Gallop to sign up on behalf of Western Australia because, by not doing so, the Gallop government is denying valuable Commonwealth funding to AusLink projects in that state. There is no state in more need of a clean-up of its building and construction industry than Western Australia. I quote from the report of the Cole royal commission, which found that the building industry in Western Australia:... is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously.At the centre of this culture and much of the unlawful and inappropriate conduct is the CFMEU.The reality is that Western Australia remains the strike capital of Australia. Its building industry is the worst performing industry of all states, and the biggest impediment is the Gallop government's failure and negligence to control the militant building unions.In 2003 in Western Australia the construction industry had a dispute rate of 567 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This compares to a national industry average for the construction industry of 249 days. In Western Australia the rate is almost double that of the whole of Australia. Currently we have a 12-day strike at the $253 million Worsley Alumina refinery in Collie. Last year Western Australians were only too aware of the $1.5 billion Perth to Mandurah railway line, which was hit by a crippling two-week strike. The Gallop government has made Western Australia the strike capital of Australia. Its building and construction industry is notorious for its poor performance. Western Australia can no longer continue to afford the Gallop government's delays and indecision.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. Obviously, unlike the Australian Labor Party, the member for Indi is interested in what opportunities will flow out of South-East Asia in the future for manufacturers, producers and exporters in her electorate. The House would recall that, at an historic meeting in Vientiane last year, the leaders of Australia, New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries agreed to launch a negotiation on a free trade agreement between those 12 countries. I am pleased to inform the House that the first round of those negotiations on an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement will begin in Melbourne on Monday.Economic modelling undertaken, I think back in 2000, by the Centre for International Economics estimated gains of about $US19.1 billion to Australia from a prospective free trade agreement between Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN countries. Trade between the nations involved already stands at about $43 billion. Major trading partners of Australia obviously exist within the near region to the north.An ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement will further open the doors for Australian businesses, like those in the electorate of Indi, to take advantage and to realise their full potential in that market of some 500 million consumers in South-East Asia. Yet, we continue to hear the same mantra, the same rhetoric, from the Labor Party, which still will not endorse the government's trade policy agenda, which has a balance between multilateral negotiations and bilateral negotiations. That is our approach to trade liberalisation. The Labor Party are still stuck in the past and continue to put out the same purist mantra about the multilateral system. That is all good and well, but the Labor Party would be well advised to heed the advice that one of their former heroes, Gough Whitlam, once gave on the impotency of purity.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have already provided him with a written answer to the question he asked me yesterday. The situation in relation to Beaudesert Rail was that it did receive, according to the criteria, a grant from the Federation Fund. It did get into financial difficulties. It did go into voluntary administration. Representations were made to the federal government and the Queensland government through the local member, the local council and other bodies to make the project financially viable.Issues of this kind, as the Leader of the Opposition I am sure would know, involve on-balance judgments. On the one hand, there was an argument that you should not invest further in the project; on the other hand, there was an argument that, having committed $5 million from the Federation Fund, a further commitment should be made. In the final analysis, the government decided to provide a grant of $600,000 as part of a package of assistance, which also included $200,000 from the shire of Beaudesert and agreement from the Queensland state Labor government's rail authority not to pursue its rights to the value of $675,000. This must go down in history as the only occasion on which the Queensland government has contributed more than the federal government to a project in Queensland. That was the basis on which the decision was made. It was an entirely proper decision and, importantly, it had the support and encouragement of the people of Beaudesert.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I appreciate her concerns to ensure that taxpayers' money is expended wisely. I can inform the House and the member for Lindsay that prescription shopping, as it is known, is not common but it does take place, and the government is taking action to stamp it out. The Health Insurance Commission, for instance, has advised of one person who, in a three-month period, obtained 200 prescriptions from 114 different doctors, and 165 of these prescriptions were for pethidine, which is a potentially addictive drug. The Health Insurance Commission maintains a database of people who in the past three months have had scripts from more than six doctors, who have had more than 25 prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs or who have had more than 50 scripts in total. I can advise the House that, in the past 12 months, 3,874 patients have been counselled about their drug use; 15 doctors have been referred for potential professional misconduct investigation; and 13 people have been referred for potential fraud prosecution. Since last Friday, doctors who suspect that their patients might be abusing prescription drugs have been able to access a new hotline and obtain information about their patients' use of prescription drugs. This was widely welcomed by the medical profession, particularly by the AMA. This measure, along with so many other measures, demonstrates that you can trust the Howard government with the nation's health care system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his ongoing support of the resources sector in what is a very big resources electorate. In terms of the performance of the resources sector, it is worth noting in this House just how well our resources sector is going. If we compare the forecast value of the resources sector exports this financial year with last financial year, we see some very good results: iron ore up 35 per cent to $7.1 billion, aluminium up seven per cent to $3.7 billion, alumina up six per cent to $4 billion, metallurgical coal up 52 per cent to $9.9 billion, thermal coal up 43 per cent to $6.2 billion and uranium up 25 per cent to $455 million. What we are seeing is a $65 billion boom for the resources sector, up 20 per cent on the previous year, with almost a $10 billion potential investment in capital expenditure.This performance has not happened by accident. It has happened as a result of the reforms of the Howard government and the strength in investment in the resources sector in Australia, which ensures that we remain competitive and sustainable. There are threats to that and they come from those who sit opposite. They come in the form of a draconian labour market. They come in the form of a Labor Party that is reluctant to invest in infrastructure as outlined by the Treasurer. - They come from this blind faith in Kyoto, which would see many of these industries driven offshore. They come from the three-mine policy, although I notice the member for Batman no longer supports that - an interesting decision from the member for Batman, which I think is enlightening for those who sit opposite. In contrast to that, we have a government that is committed to ensuring that the resources sector in Australia not only continues to contribute to the economic wellbeing of this nation but continues to provide jobs for Australians.</DOC>

As to the second part of the question, it was self-evident - as I have indicated in the House and in the letter I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition - that this project got into financial difficulty. A decision had to be made on whether further money would be advanced by the federal government, the Queensland government and the local council to see if it could be rescued or whether it would be allowed to die. They are on-balance judgments, and we made an on-balance judgment to try to bail it out. I think it was the right decision to take at the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and understand her compassion when it comes to helping other Australians to get work. This government is about helping people to find and keep jobs. Many people on welfare have no formal obligations to look for work, but they should be offered the chance to work. My department and Centrelink have instituted a new program of voluntary referrals of customers to the Job Network since November last year. As a result, there was a 97 per cent increase in referrals to the Job Network from Centrelink in December last year. That means that nearly 9,000 clients were referred to Job Network - a massive change in attitude. - It just so happens to coincide with that, Prime Minister. One thousand people on disability support pensions and nearly 8,000 people on parenting payment have now been referred to the Job Network. This is a 230 per cent increase on referrals over the previous December. These are voluntary referrals. I asked that we consult Centrelink customers to see how they appreciate the change in attitude at Centrelink, and I want to take the opportunity to praise the Centrelink employees who have been referring people to Job Network. One client said: I think it is quite fantastic that Centrelink people are referring people to the Job Network member. The Job Network member has been really helpful and it has improved my job search skills. I have had an interview for the first time in years.Many of those people referred, especially parents, were seeking part-time work to fit in with their family responsibilities. This program focuses on the significant proportion of welfare recipients who would benefit from part-time and casual work. As my colleague the Minister for Workforce Participation told the House earlier this week, Job Network placements have increased to an all-time high. I am advised that the latest Job Network performance profile shows that a total of 630,000 job placements have been recorded in the last 12 months. That is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. Significantly, nearly 170,000 were long-term jobs. So with this platform, and I emphasise that it is an early start to the program, I appreciate the work of the thousands of Centrelink employees out there who are now referring people who want to work and want the opportunity to work to Job Network, because at the end of the day a job is the best thing that we can do for people.</DOC>

 - Yes, it is a long way from Chisholm to Beaudesert. Plainly, there had been a lot of consideration of the matter before the dilemma was resolved. I will make a couple of points about this. Part of what the opposition is trying to do here is paint a picture of some sort of conspiracy carried out in great secrecy. There was no secrecy about it at all. The matter received a great deal of public exposure from around the middle of 2003 as efforts were made by the local community, the Queensland government, the Beaudesert shire, the Australian government and the provisional liquidator to find a way of overcoming the project's problems. It was pointed out in response to an earlier question that initially we thought perhaps a loan might have been the way forward. It proved not to be. As we worked through the issues surrounding this matter we came to a view on the best way forward. Yes, it was a balance of judgments. We made what we believed was an appropriate judgment and then we carried it forward.When it comes to obscurity and changing positions in relation to grants, I have to say that nobody can outdo the Leader of the Opposition. Last Sunday he appeared with Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, saying that he of course got behind all grants. Today we had him saying to Laurie Oakes that he, Beazley, was involved in `none of the grant applications'. I am sure that that is what the Leader of the Opposition told Mr Oakes, but it is not quite true. Later in the same story Laurie outlined that the Leader of the Opposition lobbied the state government to also grant money for the project. So he was involved and he does believe in getting state governments to help. He said that he was not involved and had nothing to do with it. That is interesting given that on 16 December 2003 he wrote to me in very strong support for a grant. Not only did he write to me supporting it, he actually advertised it very loudly and very significantly in his newsletter for his electorate - and I would be only too happy to table it. It said: Beazley seeks funding for study of Mangles Bay marina proposal.The member for Brand, Kim Beazley, has written to Regional Services Minister John Anderson seeking finality to the federal government's decision to support an environmental study for the proposed Mangles Bay marina.The hypocrisy of this knows no bounds whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition's position is very clear: all of these grants and proposals are absolutely terrible and ought to be shut down unless they are in Brand. I table the newsletter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. I would like to acknowledge the work done by the member for McPherson and her colleagues on the Gold Coast, the members for Fadden and Moncrieff, because the work that they do is contributing to our $73 billion tourism industry which employs more than 500,000 people, of which approximately 200,000 are employed in our regional areas. The tourism industry has been through some pretty tough times, but this government has a real commitment to it. We are currently investing around $600 million over four years, and this investment is definitely paying off because we have had a 10 per cent increase in the number of overseas visitors coming to this country. That is the largest increase we have ever had. That represents 5.2 million people. And it can get even better than that, because the projections are that there will be almost nine million overseas visitors by the year 2013. This government is investing in the emerging markets of China and India, and the success that this $73 billion industry is having is due in no small measure to the commitment and the investment by this government.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much to the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a great advocate for local projects in his own electorate. It was no surprise when I recently announced 33 new projects helping over 330 young Australians that in his electorate two recipients received support to do work on threatened species management and archaeological sites at Anglesea Heath.  -  - Do you know where that is? Have you heard of it? -  - I doubt it. Have you ever been there? I doubt it. The second project, which is of considerable benefit to the member for Corangamite, is the coastal catchments revegetation and restoration at Apollo Bay. The Green Corps project is one that this government remains committed to, because not only is it helping the environmental protection of many endangered species around the country but it is helping young people into employment. It is providing fantastic work experience opportunities. If members opposite are serious about helping the environment and helping young Australians, for goodness sake get behind this project.</DOC>

 - That is a very technical and well-researched question and I will do my very best, without any notice, to answer it. The National Water Initiative is the greatest single initiative to address the problem of water shortage in our country for generations. I welcome the fact that at last we have an expression of commitment to that initiative from a political leader from Western Australia because, when the initiative was signed, the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Gallop, held out and thereby denied to the farmers of Western Australia the opportunity to participate. The Leader of the Opposition asks me specifically why a provision relating to full cost recovery was included. I would, in addition to what I am about to say, examine the papers relating to that decision to see if there were further things, but I would have thought, if we are to have any kind of hope of dealing with the problem of water shortages in this country, we have got to in the future send more accurate market signals. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I know he and most members - probably all members - of this House share the view that climate change is an issue that has to be addressed. The international community needs to address this issue. But it is the view of this government that the problem with the Kyoto protocol is that it does not address the problem. If you actually look at what the Kyoto protocol is intended to achieve, it is intended to reduce global emissions by just one per cent below what they would have otherwise been within the target period. In other words, emissions will still be some 40 per cent higher in 2010 than they would have been in 1990. I think, if the public and the international community were aware of this, they would be less enthusiastic about Kyoto. The international community is right: the issue of climate change must be addressed. But Kyoto is not addressing it.The Kyoto protocol has set targets - but how are countries going in meeting those targets? Of the countries with targets, at the moment the current projection is that Canada will be 25 per cent above its target. Yes, it has ratified the Kyoto protocol, but it will be 25 per cent above its Kyoto target. Japan will be 13 per cent above it; Denmark, a member of the European Union, will be 38 per cent above its Kyoto target; and Ireland, 27 per cent. If you take all 25 countries in the European Union at the moment, the projection is that they will be some eight per cent overshooting their target.The point here is: if the Kyoto protocol is such a great idea, why is it doing nothing to address climate change? Our answer to that is that in this country we are spending $1.8 billion to address this issue and we are on target - we are on, if you like, our Kyoto target. So, whilst we do not believe in the Kyoto process for very good reason, because the Kyoto process is not working and is not workable, nevertheless we are able to make a substantial contribution ourselves to addressing this issue. It is the view of this government that the international community needs to get together and work through ideas which will seriously address this problem, not resort to the sort of stuntsmanship that we have seen from the opposition on this issue over the last few days, and ensure that the international community is driven more by substantial policy outcomes than the mere symbolism which is all that Kyoto amounts to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I can report that Western Australia, being part of Australia, has enjoyed the wonderful economic conditions of the last nine years. I think it is fair to say that, whenever the national economy of Australia performs well, the premiers of Australia - whatever their political stripe may be - try to claim credit for the economic growth in their own states. But the reality is that the federal government is responsible for the economic health of this country. That means, when the national economy is doing badly, the federal government is to blame, and, when the national economy is doing well, the federal government is entitled to take some of the credit. So it is with the economy of Western Australia.I have noticed with interest in the current election campaign that the Western Australian Premier is asking the people of Western Australia to re-elect him on the grounds of the strength of the Western Australian economy. Without in any way denigrating the contribution of those Australians who live in Western Australia, let me say that the strength of the Western Australian economy - which is undoubted - is due overwhelmingly to the economic policies of the coalition government, just as the strength of the Queensland economy, the strength of the New South Wales economy, the strength of the South Australian economy and the strength of the Tasmanian economy are.The message that I would like to convey is that Western Australia could be doing even better if it had a state government that followed policies that were more supportive of the national government in a number of important areas. Let us take the very important area of industrial relations. The rate of working days lost in Western Australia due to industrial disputes has trebled since the year 2001. By June 2004 Western Australia's rate of 121 working days lost per thousand employees was almost twice the national average of 67. It is right to say, as Western Australian premiers of both political complexions have said to me over the years, that Western Australia may have only 11 per cent of the population but it contributes 28 per cent of the export income of the nation. It is also fair to say that there is no reason that Western Australia cannot have an industrial record the equal of the national average and the equal of the best that is achieved around Australia. That can happen if Western Australia has a change of state government.Let me say of the alternative Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, whom I know well, that he is rightly making an issue in this campaign of taking decisions and not dithering about decisions being taken by government because, as minister for resources and energies in the 1990s, for example, he was the driving force behind the Dampier to Perth gas pipeline. I know that that is an example of the kind of focus that he will be able to bring to the government of that wonderful state if he is elected Premier on 26 February.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. Yesterday in this place we established quite plainly that the Leader of the Opposition is quite a hypocrite when it comes to the Regional Partnerships program because what he has in essence been saying is this: `This is a program that should be shut down and everyone should give their money back, except in the case of the five grants in Brand,' because he supported them. He has made applications for them. He has told his electorate how hard he has been working to secure them. But in his embarrassment and in his desire to recapture some lost territory in this place, he flourished quite dramatically a swag of press clippings which purported to show that the government was abusing regional partnership announcements. It was not that Regional Partnerships was the problem any more; it was the way the government was using the announcements, specifically by having the Liberal Party candidate in Brand make these announcements in a way that was plainly meant to favour that candidate and which was demonstrating precisely how the government was `using these rorts as opportunities to create bogus local reputations for their candidates'.Nine of these clippings were tabled by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, and overnight I have had a chance to look at them. I must say there were quite a number of announcements. I was amazed to discover - if they were all made by Liberal Party candidates - that you had quite a number of Liberal Party candidates in the seat of Brand. There was funding under the Black Spots Program, the roads program, by the Liberal Party candidate for Brand, whose name is Senator Ian Campbell! He made that announcement. There was Regional Partnerships funding announced by the Liberal Party candidate for Brand, my then parliamentary secretary, De-Anne Kelly! Then we had a confiscated illegal fishing boat; the Liberal Party candidate for Canning made that announcement. And then Senator Ellison presented a cheque for the Rockingham marina - a Regional Partnerships grant.  -  - The Leader of the Opposition's claim that these announcements had all been made by the Liberal Party candidate in that seat is absolutely wrong. Only one announcement was made in all of these press reports by the candidate. The announcement was that he would be resigning from the marina project because he was about to become the candidate. That is the only announcement made in all of the material the opposition tabled yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition owes that candidate an apology for the claim that he was trying to establish a bogus reputation. - That candidate was the founder and president of the Rockingham Marina Action Group, the treasurer of the Cruising Yacht Club of Rockingham, the chairman for marketing and promotion for Tourism Rockingham, and the co-founder of the West Coast Dive Action Group. He did not need a bogus local reputation; he is a man of real standing in the area. He is owed an apology by the Leader of the Opposition and, I tell you this, so is the Leader of the Opposition's own party because of his hypocrisy in this matter. He has led them to believe that he thinks this program should be closed down. He plainly does not. He thinks it should be strongly supported, because he has been out there actively campaigning for support under the program in the electorate of Brand.</DOC>

 - I must confess that I do not specifically recall that, but I will not argue with the Leader of the Opposition as to whether those words were actually uttered; but as to what the context of that may have been I would have to have a look. Let me address the issue of debt. I think we are all aware that at various stages in our existence, whether as a nation, as individuals or as companies, we have debt. The question of the size of that debt and the manageability of that debt is determined by our capacity to service that debt. One of the products of the sparkling performance of the Australian economy over the last few years is that our capacity to service foreign debt has increased dramatically. One of the reasons that our capacity has increased spectacularly is the volume of government debt. Bear in mind that the foreign debt, which the Leader of the Opposition is undoubtedly alluding to, is of course largely the debt of individuals and corporations. The government itself has made a tremendous contribution towards reducing the government's contribution to debt. In fact, at 3.9 per cent of GDP, name me a developed country in the world that has a lower proportion to GDP of government debt than Australia. The OECD average is about 45 to 50 per cent; in the United States it is about 45 per cent; in Japan I think it is over 100 per cent; and ours is 3.9 per cent. That is due to the fact that when the government came to office and inherited a budget deficit of $10½ billion from the Leader of the Opposition, who was the outgoing finance minister, this government, despite the attempts of the Labor Party and others in the Senate to frustrate its budget reduction program, set about not only getting rid of that $10½ billion but also accumulating surpluses and paying off debt. That is one of the reasons why this country is in such a strong economic position. I warmly thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question.</DOC>

 - Petrol sniffing is a serious problem. It has claimed far too many Indigenous lives, and I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for the concern he has to promote better Indigenous health in communities in the Territory. In 1998 the Commonwealth introduced a special scheme to substitute aviation fuel for normal petrol in remote Indigenous communities to help combat the problem of petrol sniffing. Because aviation fuel did not contain aromatic hydrocarbons, it was not attractive to sniffers. But as a result of environmental changes avgas has now become unleaded. It will contain aromatic hydrocarbons and therefore it is no longer an effective substitute for use in communities which are prone to petrol sniffing.I am very pleased to say that BP Australia has now developed a special type of unleaded fuel without any aromatic hydrocarbons, specially designed for use in remote Indigenous communities. I am pleased to say that, thanks to this, the government will continue to spend $1 million a year supplying unsniffable fuel to remote communities where petrol sniffing is a potential problem. Because of this, the government will be able to continue to work with community leaders in the fight against petrol sniffing. It is a very important fight. This has claimed 100 Indigenous lives since 1981. It needs to be continued and it will be continued thanks to this government and the good work of BP Australia.</DOC>

 - I am aware, broadly and in some areas in some detail, of the evidence given. I am also aware of the very clear distinction that is apparent in the Army's manual between interviews and interrogations. I have followed the comments that have been made by the member for Barton on this subject and I have also followed the comments of Mr Neil James, the head of the Australian Defence Association - a former intelligence officer and a lieutenant colonel in the Australian Army. I quote from what he said last night on the PM program:So what he - namely, Mr Barton - was in effect doing was he was questioning someone inside a facility that ... was used for detailed interrogation. But his questioning of that subject was by no means an interrogation.That is from somebody who was an intelligence officer. With the greatest of respect to the member for Barton, whom I do respect, Mr James knows a little more about this subject than the member for Barton has indicated with his comments. The reality is that within the military there is a clear understanding of this distinction. It comes out in the manual. I do stand by my minister and I think he has been unfairly, wrongly and quite disgracefully criticised by the opposition on this issue.Let us get to the essence of this issue. The essence of this issue is that at no stage last year when we were talking about Abu Ghraib was there any evidence of substance - any evidence at all - that Australians had been involved in prisoner abuse. The whole exercise last year was designed, however indirectly, to create a different impression. The Leader of the Opposition knows this and those who sit on the front bench know this. Frankly, I think there are a growing number of Australians who are sick and tired of this endeavour to spear people who are trying to do an honest job on behalf of this country. They are getting sick and tired of it.Obviously it is impossible for the defence minister or the Prime Minister, whether you have a Labor government or a Liberal government, to know the minutiae of everything that takes place in a theatre of conflict. We have to rely on the information that is provided to us by the defence department. I think the Defence people have done their level best to provide accurate information to the Senate, accurate information to ministers and accurate information to me. There is a difference between interrogation and interview. That is clearly spelled out in the military manual. It is understood by Lieutenant Colonel James. It is understood by the military officers who gave evidence to the Senate estimates committee yesterday. It ought to be understood by the Leader of the Opposition, who is a former defence minister, and it should now be understood by the member for Barton.This exercise we have had over the past few days has been a nitpicking attempt to damage the political reputation of the Minister for Defence. I can understand that it is the mission of an opposition to damage the political reputation of their opponents, but in the process they have made unreasonable, unfair and inaccurate remarks about members of the Australian Defence Force. That is something that I am certainly opposed to and that is something that this side of the House will never defend and never support and never condone. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and recognise his long representation in his electorate. The port of Gladstone, in particular, is one of the foremost export ports in Australia for bulk products, particularly from the resources sector. The member for Hinkler would know that that port is owned and operated by the Queensland government, along with a number of others in Queensland.In answer to the member's question, the value of Australia's resources exports rose by 13 per cent in 2004 to a figure of almost $40 billion, which is the second highest level on record in Australia for the resources sector. A significant proportion of that was our coal exports, leading the way with growth in value. They grew by 24 per cent in 2004. This certainly is a remarkable performance as far as the resources sector is concerned. It sustains the livelihood of many people and of course a lot of the work force in the electorate of the member for Hinkler, particularly in Gladstone, which, by the way, returned the member for Hinkler with a very comfortable majority. It is a very wise electorate.The Minerals Council has estimated that the resources sector is proposing to invest about $8.2 billion in 2004-05. A lot of that is going to be going into improvements in infrastructure across Australia in terms of getting those exports from their source out of the country to our export markets. Along with what our government is doing, particularly through programs like AusLink where we are set to invest $12½ billion over five years in Australia's road and rail infrastructure, it is all going towards developing the logistical supply chain to match the needs in the marketplace and the ability of our exports sector to deliver to those needs in the marketplace.You might ask what the state governments across Australia are doing. What are the states doing, the people that control a lot of the export ports across Australia? We know what the Queensland state government is not doing. They are not investing in infrastructure, but they are collecting massive amounts of royalties from our resources sector. The Queensland government has forecast that it will receive around $800 million in royalties in 2004-05 from our resources exports. It is also forecast that that may even go through the billion dollar mark being collected by the Queensland government. Yet they will not invest any money back into the much needed infrastructure to accommodate the growth in the export of resources out of that state. They will not even fund a 70-kilometre rail link, worth around $100 million, to Abbott Point, which would immediately alleviate the bottleneck that currently exists at Dalrymple Bay, an issue that the Treasurer spoke about yesterday.One of the local mayors in Queensland, the Mayor of Bowen, who wants to see this investment take place, said about the Queensland government: `It is just a matter of someone pulling their finger out and getting on with it.' We agree with him. The Queensland government should get on with investing in assets that will help our exporters get their product out, instead of living off the infrastructure that was invested by previous Queensland governments, particularly the Bjelke-Petersen government, over the last 30 years. They should stop loafing on that, join the Australian government and industry and invest in what we need to enhance our export infrastructure for the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The essence of the question, I think, is that there really is no difference between interrogation and interviewing. That, I think, is a fair representation of what he is putting. Particularly in the context of military operations, I do not accept that. The Australian military forces do not accept that and Neil James, who is the original author of the ADF interrogation manual, does not accept that either. Speaking on the PM program last night he had a number of things to say about the difference between interrogation and interview. He said:The rough working definition is simply ... you're free to get up and leave. In an interrogation you are not. There's some form of legal or criminal or physical restriction.Generally speaking in most situations there's a clear-cut difference between what's an interview and what's an interrogation.The opposition defence spokesman, the member for Barton, yesterday in contradistinction, when he was asked whether he thought there was an argument in the distinction between terms of interrogation and debriefing - and bear in mind that the expression `debrief' is being used interchangeably with the expression `interview' - replied:No there is not ... They have used a highly technical definition. Even on the basis of that highly technical definition there was unquestionably interrogation.That is the view of the member for Barton and he may hold that view and he is entitled to hold that view. But what I am putting in all seriousness to the opposition is that that is not the view of the Australian military. It is not the view of the head of the Defence Association. It was not the view of the head of military operations in Iraq who commissioned the circumstances under which people would participate in the Iraq Survey Group, and it was clearly not the view of the defence department when they provided advice to both the defence minister and to me last year. This all arises out of an attempt by the opposition to allege that in some way the defence minister and I and others in the government have misled the parliament and the Australian public.We have done no such thing. At all stages in relation to this we have been absolutely candid. The people who are trying to distort the language, with great respect, are those who are speaking for the opposition, because they are refusing to accept what I do and what I believe most people who have examined it will do: that in the military context there is a clear distinction between an interview and an interrogation. It is spelt out in an Australian Army manual. So if it was meaningless and if we were just playing with words, why would it be spelt out in an Australian Army manual? I say again: we have the head of the Defence Association, a former intelligence officer, who has said it very clearly. And I make no comments about Mr Barton - he is entitled to his view - but the reality is that when he signed the questionnaire that was sent out last year, the word he used was `interview'. He is a person who quintessentially was in a much better position to know the difference between `interrogation' and `interview' than I was, or the Leader of the Opposition or indeed anybody else, because he in fact had been commissioned as part of the Iraq Survey Group and he understood the terms of that commission and the terms of that engagement. He used the word `interview' when he answered the question last year. He did not use `interrogation'; he used `interview'. I suggest he did that because he then understood very clearly the distinction that existed between the two concepts, as Lieutenant Colonel James understands it, as Barton's commanding officer understands it and as I know the Leader of the Opposition understands it. Anybody who has studied the manual will understand the difference. There is a difference in Australian military parlance between the two concepts. And when that is understood, any suggestion that Senator Hill has misled the Australian public on this issue is completely false.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and her very strong support for the government's initiatives to drive national consistency and high nationally consistent standards in Australian schooling. One of the many initiatives announced by the government during the recent election campaign was that we will move to develop and establish an Australian certificate of education which could be undertaken by students across Australia as an alternative to the conventional year 12 examinations conducted in eight different jurisdictions.I will shortly be calling for tenders for appropriate organisations to develop the model, which would be based on four things. The first is that we can drive consistency amongst the eight different jurisdictions at the moment in terms of year 12 assessment and make sure that we have a common test across Australia. Alternatively, the Australian certificate of education could be based on a national curriculum based assessment. Thirdly, it could take the form of a student aptitude test, which is currently applied quite successfully across the United States of America. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Australian certificate of education could be based on the template of the international baccalaureate, which is currently being undertaken by 20,000 Australian students throughout schools because, increasingly, parents and teachers and students are frustrated and looking for a nationally and internationally recognised and consistent qualification.No sooner had I announced the detail in relation to this than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued a media release on 7 February this year which described this move for national consistency and the certificate of education in the following terms: absurd, meaningless, nonsense, bureaucratic nightmare - and so on it goes. So obviously at least the Labor Party is consistent in criticising anything which drives national consistency and high quality in standards. Then I thought, no, not everybody in the Labor Party could think that way. Then I recalled that, slipped among my Christmas cards on Christmas Eve, was a letter that I had received from one of the Labor MPs. This one, rather than being the typical one you get from the Labor backbench wilderness, was indeed from the front bench. The letter read in part: `Dear Minister, I write on behalf of a certain school located in my electorate. The school is interested in offering the international baccalaureate course to interested students. Indeed the school is collaborating with two other schools on the development of an international baccalaureate pilot program. Currently, government schools in Victoria are not allowed to offer such a course. However, in order to pilot the international baccalaureate some funding would be required. I would be grateful for your indication as to whether such a program would be considered for funding under the Howard government's Investing in our Schools program.' That, as the Prime Minister knows, is the $1 billion that this government is investing to cut through constipated educational bureaucracies to support things that are desperately needed at the school level. The letter goes on: `I would also be grateful if you would consider allocating time when you are in Melbourne to meet with representatives with the schools who are interested in this new development in public education. I look forward to your reply.'I am sure that Julia Gillard, member for Lalor, shadow minister for health and alternate Deputy Leader of the Opposition, will look forward to my reply. My reply is that I look forward to meeting those schools. And I ask the member for Lalor: why don't we jointly write to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and she can come along to the meeting too? It would be a lovely meeting, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can actually listen to what parents are saying. They have had it up to here with inconsistent national standards and they are sick and tired of educational ideologues in education departments telling them what they know is not in the interests of their children.</DOC>

 - At no stage have I accused Mr Barton of being a liar. - No, I do not accuse Mr Barton of being a liar. People can hold strong views about circumstances which are different from each other without either of them being a liar. I am not casting any aspersions on Mr Barton's character; I am going to the essence of this issue. The essence of this issue is that the Labor Party has tried to establish and continues to allege that the lying and the deception of the Australian public has come from the defence minister and myself. What I am doing is pointing out that there is a clear distinction between interrogation and interview in a military situation.  - I am glad the member for Griffith asked, `Was I there?' No, I was not. I thank the member for Griffith - that was one of his better interjections. Of course I was not there, and therefore I have to rely on the advice I receive from the defence department and I have to rely also on the analysis of experts. May I again return to Neil James. This is what he had to say in that very lengthy and very informative interview on PM last night:Rod Barton is a very distinguished biological warfare intelligence analyst.I have no argument with that; I am not suggesting he is not. I have not met him but I have no reason to denigrate his professional qualifications in that department, and I will not. James goes on to say:He's not a qualified interrogator. I don't know whether he's had any exposure to the interrogation process. But it's quite common for people with no understanding of the process, or little understanding of the process, to misunderstand the things they see and the safeguards employed.The question of whether Mr Barton believed then - which apparently he did not, because he described it last year as an interview - or he believes now does not alter the requirement that all of us make an objective analysis of what it was. To aid that objective analysis we must look at the military manual, which draws a clear distinction between an interrogation and an interview. That was the basis of the advice that Defence transmitted to Senator Hill last year. It remains the basis of Defence's advice and it is the basis of my claim that the attempt by the opposition to discredit the integrity of the Minister for Defence is completely false and completely dishonourable.</DOC>

 - I understand how many members of this House have been concerned about how the increase in and availability of public liability insurance to so many local community groups put at risk the future of many events, such as country shows. I am pleased to inform the House that the ACCC has just released a report which shows that the premiums for public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance have both fallen significantly. The report shows that the premiums for public liability insurance have fallen by 15 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is very welcome news for the community. It means that community events that were at risk due to increased premiums will now be under less financial stress and, as a result, we have a better chance of these very important aspects of community life continuing to operate.The finding is also very welcome news for business and particularly small business who have to find the money for the public liability insurance premiums. These reductions will be very welcome by them. The report shows that professional indemnity insurance premiums have also fallen by 17 per cent in the six months to June 2004. This is after a number of increases in previous years. Whilst these lower premiums are welcome, the government realise there is more to be done, and we will have to monitor these prices over time to ensure they do not escalate. To that end, I have agreed that the ACCC continue to monitor prices and to make that information available in an annual report, and this will be done for next three years. The one major item of tort law reform that remains outstanding is the passing of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which were stymied by the opposition in the Senate. We will be reintroducing that measure, and I call on the Labor Party to change their position to assist the government to keep downward pressure on insurance rates. </DOC>

 - I have absolutely no idea as to the accuracy or nature of the member for Fraser's allegations. I will consult with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who was responsible for the administration of Dairy RAP. I presume the opposition is now going to smear Dairy RAP, a program which the federal government put in place to help the dairy farmers of this country when the states deregulated that industry - cold turkey - which resulted in enormous dislocation and economic and social trauma. But, as to the details of the allegations, I will consult with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and report back to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston. He would be interested to know that since 1996 there have been 530 new apprentices in training in his electorate, which is a 221 per cent increase. I urge the member to work hard to get an even better result over the years ahead. New apprenticeship centres, NACs - such as National Apprenticeship Services in Morphett Vale in his electorate - are contracted by the government to provide information and support, coordinate the relationships between apprentices and their employers and administer incentives for new apprenticeships. Over the last two years the number of new apprenticeship centres - an investment by this government in Australian apprenticeships - has increased from 300 to some 500 right around Australia. This year the government will spend more than $685 million on incentives paid directly to employers of new apprentices and on the provision of these support services. This support is absolutely essential. It is helping young people to get a start in traditional trades such as metal trades, motor trades, carpentry and plumbing. We have seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of those taking up those trades, which proves the success of the NACs. A recent survey which was commissioned by my department, to listen to people, found that employers and indeed their new apprentices are highly satisfied with the work done by the new apprenticeship centres. Nine out of every 10 employers surveyed indicated that they would use the same NAC again. In fact, 93.1 per cent said they would employ a new apprentice again in the future, which is exactly what the government wants to see Australian businesses doing. This is why the ongoing success of the government's many measures to deal with the growth of new apprentices in the Australian economy has grown training in Australia from a pitiful 141,000 apprentices in 1995 to around 400,000 today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In essence, it goes to the question of checking and establishing whether or not programs are worthy and whether they are going to make a difference in terms of jobs and local outcomes. In this particular case, the normal probity arrangements and checks would have been taken - I am sure of that -  -  - Occasionally, with the best will in the world, companies do go under. I will undertake to check the veracity of the member for Wills's claim and come back to the House on it. The House might like to know that I checked with my department to see whether or not any of the offers made by the federal Labor Party to various constituencies around the country during the election campaign had been submitted for any analysis or costing. First amongst those offers was the $150 million they promised for the Murwillumbah-Casino railway line. There were no probity checks whatsoever; there was not even an analysis done by the shadow minister for transport at the time. -  - Oh, you did check it? Let us see it. Where is it? -  - It was not; it was done by the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Carr in New South Wales. We have not received any applications or requests for checking in relation to an offer of $1 million for a national centre of democracy at Ballarat; none for a $10 million commitment for a national museum of Indigenous culture in Cairns; nothing for the $1.5 million for a turtle interpretation centre in Queensland; $3 million for a sporting complex at Thuringowa; $6 million for the Rockhampton showgrounds; or $12.5 million to upgrade transport infrastructure at Blacktown. And the opposition have a go at us for a Tasmanian package of $12 million. What about their $54 million Tasmanian package? And it goes on and on. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this knows no bounds whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition's motto is very simple: `Do as I say, not as I do - and I hope none of you notice that in my electorate I support the regional programs.' I also think it is time the opposition started to tell us which programs they would withdraw funding from. They should go out and tell the people who have had the benefit of those programs which ones they do not support. They should go down to Mogo, in the member for Eden-Monaro's seat, and tell those people that the $97,000 that secured four full-time jobs in a zoo should be withdrawn, that they should all go back on welfare and that the tourism industry should just fold up and go back to where it was. - There are proper processes in place, the opposition's own Senate inquiry is probing those processes, and I am sure the department will be only too happy to explain what processes are in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. What an outstanding local representative is the member for Greenway. Last year I visited St Elizabeth's Nursing Home and Hostel in her electorate. She is an outstanding advocate for aged care issues. Today I announced details of a key plank of the government's reform agenda on aged care - the conditions attaching to the $877 million funding boost announced in the last budget. This payment was in addition to the annually indexed aged care subsidy already provided by the government. In order to receive this extra payment aged care providers must prepare a financial report that is audited annually and made available to residents, they must provide and encourage training opportunities for all their staff and take part in work force surveys and work force reporting.This conditional adjustment payment means that there is more transparent financial reporting in the aged care sector. That will boost market confidence and encourage greater investment in the sector. It means that there is more funding available for aged care providers so that they can pay competitive wages to staff to ensure that we continue to attract and retain quality aged care staff and it means greater improvements in the quality of care.This government is building consumer confidence and market confidence in the aged care sector. It is part of our ongoing reform agenda to ensure that we have a sustainable, flexible and innovative aged care sector - a leading model for aged care across the world. This is our government's reform agenda, and we are delivering on it.</DOC>

 - The interjections have started already, because we know the Labor Party hates the Work for the Dole program. On 327 occasions now someone across there has criticised that program. I have reported that to the House before. We are still looking for a commitment to this program from the member for Brand. I start by congratulating the member for Stirling on a fantastic result in his seat. It is great to have a live member in Stirling. He is somebody who has supported local community groups already -  - Absolutely; no slur was intended, whatsoever. It goes to show how sensitive the Labor Party is about this program. This program is providing real results for young Australians, yet at every opportunity the opposition opposes this program. Recently I announced 339 new programs which will help 4,000 young people across this country to provide support to their local communities. This government remains absolutely committed to the Work for the Dole program. In the member for Stirling's electorate one of those programs relates to the assistance provided to the local PCYC - helping the local police in that community to work with the children to provide support around the administration of the centre. It is a wonderful program that contributes right around the country - to the relief aid in the tsunami affected areas right across Indonesia. If the opposition remains opposed to the Work for the Dole program, why don't they dispense with the semantics and come out and say where they stand. If they are opposed to it they should scrap it as part of their policy. This government is committed to the program because it is part of the reason we have been able to bring unemployment levels down by half compared to when the opposition leader was the employment services minister.</DOC>

 - Through you, Mr Speaker, let me be charitable and courteous to the Leader of the Opposition -  
Government members - Oh! - as occasionally it is appropriate - and accept that he has correctly quoted from a question that I asked back in September 1995. Can I gently point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, although I would have to very carefully check every example that he has cited, I would have thought over the last few years the growth performance of the Australian economy far outstripped that of just about every country in the example that he has quoted.The Leader of the Opposition has promised a more sophisticated debate on the economy. One of the things that the Leader of the Opposition ought to understand is that over the last five years - and you can even go back over the last 10 years - the growth performance of the Australian economy, the reductions in unemployment that we have achieved, the business investment levels that we have achieved and the fiscal strength that we have achieved have far outstripped that of every country with which it is reasonable to make comparisons.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for what is a very important question about a very encouraging series of developments. I would be the first to agree that one should greet with some caution the announcement made over the weekend about a phased Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. But the very fact that that announcement has been made is a remarkable thing in itself, and it is the latest in a series of very encouraging developments. As I will mention to the House later when I make a statement about the sending of an Australian task group to southern Iraq, one of the most inspiring images of recent years has been that of brave Iraqi men and women holding their ink-stained fingers aloft after they have participated in an exercise in democracy. That particular event is of a piece with other encouraging events in the Middle East: the democratic process that led to the election of Mahmoud Abbas, who is showing a strength and a dignity in leading the Palestinian people that was absent in earlier years, and the hopeful developments towards a more democratic approach in even Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Taking all of these events together, there is reason to have both hope and some belief that things may be taking a turn for the better.I do not want to overstate it, and in all likelihood some of the advances that have been made over the last few months will go into reverse in the future, but it was almost unthinkable six months ago that people could be talking about the sort of successful election that took place in Iraq, it was almost unthinkable six months ago that people could be even talking about a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and it was unthinkable six months ago that we could be talking about the possibility of some kind of settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.There are obligations on everyone in this. That is my view, and I am speaking as somebody who has always been a close and unapologetic supporter of the state of Israel. That is a view that I conveyed to the Israeli President when I saw him last week: that there are obligations on Israel as there are obligations on the Palestinians. It remains one of the great missed opportunities of modern times that the offer made by Ehud Barak in the year 2000 was not taken up by Yasser Arafat. But that is five years ago; it is in the past. What we are concerned about is the opportunities of the present.Can I say to the honourable member for Mitchell that there are some signs of real hope, but we do need to have further dialogue to bring about an immediate withdrawal of the Syrian forces, the end of external support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and the disbanding of the militias. The announcement made by the Syrian leader is only a beginning, but one hopes there is progress made on that. If indeed we do see further progress, history may well record that the toppling of Saddam Hussein from his position of brutal dictatorship was one of the more significant events in the Middle East in long years.</DOC>

 - I stand by everything that I said in relation to the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Can I simply make the point - he keeps talking about broken commitments - that the commitment that, above all, I made to the Australian people at the time of the last election was to maintain the strength of the Australian economy. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, to try and bring him back to a little sense of reality - and I know he does not really like to hear this - that this country has the lowest unemployment level in 30 years. It still has historically low interest rates, infinitely lower interest rates than Labor was ever able to manage in the years that it was in government. It has a budget surplus which, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia when he was giving testimony to the House of Representatives committee a couple of weeks ago, is the envy of reserve bank governors, central bank governors and governments around the world.This government have given the Australian economy a strong fiscal position. We have reduced unemployment, we have brought forth business investment and, desperate though the Leader of the Opposition may be to try and build a case of economic calamity off the back of an adjustment of a quarter of one per cent in interest rates, nothing can gainsay the fact that, on any comparison, over the last five to 10 years the Australian economy has had a stellar performance. No sort of twisting and turning by the Leader of the Opposition can alter that fact. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of an answer I gave on 23 September last year when being interviewed on the Neil Mitchell program. When asked:So you wouldn't be embarrassed to win the election and then have an interest rates rise?I replied:Well I don't seek to give guarantees, judgements about individual movements. My argument is that they will always be lower under our policies and that argument is supported by the last time Labor was in government and the impact of their industrial relations policies.That was what I said before the election. It remains true and no amount of misrepresentation by the Leader of the Opposition will alter that fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. Although it is a public document I can again table the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which has as its objective the abolition of inefficient state taxes. It details the taxes that the states pledged to abolish in response to receiving GST revenue. Some of them, such as debits tax, they pledged to abolish by 2001 and the remainder they promised to review in 2005 in the light of collections to ascertain whether those collections would justify and fund the removal of the remaining taxes.Since 1 July 2000, when the GST came in, the collections have exceeded expectations. In 2004-05, on the latest estimates given to heads of Treasury, New South Wales will get a windfall of $124 million, Victoria will get a windfall of $272 million, Western Australia will get a windfall of $252 million, South Australia will get a windfall of $160 million, Tasmania will get a windfall of $100 million and Queensland will get a windfall the dimensions of which would be embarrassing if I read it out to the House. -  - No, it is embarrassing - no, no I cannot do it in all conscience! In response to those rising GST collections, there is now no excuse for the state governments not to abolish those taxes which were outlined for abolition in 1999. We will be holding state governments to the agreement that they signed in 1999 because we are going to stand up for the taxpayers and the consumers of Australia. The critical question, of course, is whether the other side of politics will stand up for the consumers and businesses of Australia. In an otherwise embarrassing interview on the Insiders on Sunday, the member for Lilley actually did say this - and I compliment him for saying it:I think the states should adhere to the principles they signed up to in the GST agreement.That is fair enough. There is the agreement. A few phone calls must have been made on Sunday night because on Sunday he said, 'The states should adhere to the signed GST agreement.' On his way into parliament this morning he was asked the very same question. Listen to his answer from this morning. Question: 'What is your view on these state taxes, Wayne? Should they be reduced?' His answer: 'My view on the state taxes is the Commonwealth and the states ought to sit down and renegotiate their agreement.'Why would you renegotiate the agreement? It is a written, signed agreement. The signed agreement requires the states, as they receive GST revenue, to abolish those state taxes. There is nothing to renegotiate. What there is to do is to hold the states to their agreement. That is what has to be done, and that is what this government will defend. One of Labor's so-called statesmen was quoted as saying: 'When the state Labor premiers joined forces to bring down the member for Werriwa as Leader of the Opposition and to install the now member for Brand, it would have been a bad day for the Labor Party because the new leader of federal Labor, having been placed there by state premiers, would be incapable of ever standing up to state Labor premiers.' They wanted a patsy as leader and they found a patsy as leader - the patsy from Brand. Within 24 hours, the signed agreement - which federal Labor said the states had to agree - has to be renegotiated. Let me make it clear: there is nothing to renegotiate. The only thing that has to be done is to uphold this agreement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and appreciate her interest in this issue. Let me make it clear to start with that the government does welcome the decision of the Indonesian South Jakarta District Court to convict Abu Bakar Bashir for his involvement in the Bali bombings. Bashir was convicted by the court for conspiracy to cause an explosion. It also has to be said that the government is disappointed about the length of the sentence. The sentence handed down was for 30 months, with the 10 months that Abu Bakar Bashir has been in prison already to be taken into account. Given that Abu Bakar Bashir has been convicted of the involvement of a conspiracy in relation to the Bali bombings in which 88 of our fellow citizens died, we believe that that sentence is too light. On the day the sentence was handed down, I instructed our ambassador to make contact with Indonesian authorities and to let it be known that we regard that sentence as too short and hope that the prosecution may consider lodging an appeal so that the sentence through the appeals process can be lengthened.I do not want people to make the mistake of thinking that today Indonesia's legal system is the same as it was under President Suharto. It is not. This is an independent legal system and we respect the independence of the Indonesian courts. So we hope that the prosecution will consider appealing to a higher court. Let me also say that Indonesia does have a strong track record on arresting and prosecuting terrorists and that we appreciate enormously the cooperation of the Indonesian government - President Megawati and President Bambang Yudhoyono, other ministers and officials in Indonesia - since the Bali bombings in countering terrorism.Remember that all 33 prosecuted in the Denpasar courts for their role in the Bali bombings have been found guilty. Three of those have been sentenced to death and four of them have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Since December 2000, Indonesian authorities have detained 178 individuals on terrorist related charges. The government will continue to assist Indonesia to combat terrorism. We appreciate enormously what the Indonesian government has done to fight terrorism. That should not be underestimated, but we do hope that an appeal can be lodged and successfully achieved to extend the sentence handed down to Abu Bakar Bashir.</DOC>

 - I am always happy to check the transcripts of what anybody says in contributing to the economic debate. I certainly find when I look at the Treasurer's transcripts that his is always a very constructive and intelligent contribution to the economic debate. My recollection of the last few days is that when the Treasurer has talked about comparative interest rates he has talked about interest rates moving between six and eight per cent. My recollection is that that has been during the time that we have been in government. He has also mentioned a movement between 10½ and 17 per cent. I wonder who was in government when we had that movement!Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that he can spend all of question time nitpicking about interest rates. The reality is that they are now very low by historic standards. Whether or not you are a borrower, nobody likes interest rates to go up - that is never welcome - but the reality is that a 25 basis point movement in interest rates does not of itself in any way undermine the basic strength of the Australian economy. It is important we preserve a sense of proportion. The last great interest rate movement that really occupied the attention of this parliament was in fact the interest rate movement totalling some two per cent in an upward direction that occurred during the last two years of the Keating government. I think it brought forth an observation from me that this country had enjoyed just five minutes of economic sunshine before the interest rates had begun to rise.I have got disappointing news for the Leader of the Opposition: you cannot run a negative scare campaign of doom and gloom off the back of a 25 basis point increase in interest rates, particularly when you have such an appalling heritage as a member of a former government that presided over interest rates of 17 per cent for home owners, 20 per cent for small business and 21 per cent for Australian farmers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I am sure he as a new member in this place, especially as he comes from Western Australia, has a great deal of interest in our relationships with our near neighbours in South-East Asia. In recent years the relationship with Malaysia - economically and otherwise - has been significantly improving. We welcome the announcement made by the Prime Minister yesterday that Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi will visit Australia in April. It is interesting to note that this will be the first official visit to Australia by a Malaysian Prime Minister since 1984. It is over 20 years since a Malaysian Prime Minister has visited Australia.This visit provides an opportunity for both Australia and Malaysia to explore ways that we can further strengthen the already substantial economic relationship that exists between our two countries. Malaysia is now our ninth largest trading partner, with two-way trade last year worth about $9.6 billion. In July last year I agreed with my Malaysian counterpart, Minister Rafidah Aziz, that we would conduct parallel scoping studies for a free trade agreement between Australia and Malaysia. Those studies are now substantially complete and both sides are close to deciding the next step in this process. Obviously the benefits from an FTA would include further reductions of tariff barriers to agricultural exports; greater flows, both direct and indirect; investment; and better access for our services sector, particularly educational institutions and legal firms.It is interesting to note the substantial size of the trading relationship that exists between the two countries today. In 1993, the year that Prime Minister Keating made that infamous 'recalcitrant' comment, two-way trade between the two countries was worth $3.9 billion. This year - 2005, the year that the Howard government welcomes and hosts a visit by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi - two-way trade will be worth over $10 billion. Our objective is to continue to strengthen this important regional relationship.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I appreciate her interest. Iraq's interim Prime Minister Allawi said on 3 March:I want to thank, really, Prime Minister Howard and the Australian people, and the Government of Australia for their commitment. Australia will always be remembered as a great friend of Iraq.Of course the Japanese, the British and the Americans have also strongly welcomed our decision to provide an additional deployment to the al-Muthana province. This is also a decision that was made under the United Nations Security Council resolution 1546, so those who believe we should act under United Nations Security Council resolutions will be pleased to know that this is indeed under one of those resolutions.Iraq is at a critical point, and any responsible political party - any responsible government - would want to see the new Iraq succeed. It does not matter what views you once had about whether Saddam Hussein should have been removed or not - and I know some in this House criticised the government for the role we played in removing Saddam Hussein - but you would think all people today would think that the important thing is to make sure that the new, democratic Iraq is a success. Australia is not just a small, regional player; Australia is a significant country with a significant contribution to make to the world, not just its region. With that in mind, why would we turn our backs on the people of Iraq at this critical time?The ALP, under their revived Leader of the Opposition - not surprisingly, as is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition in years gone by - want to walk both sides of the street. The Leader of the Opposition said in a doorstop on 22 February on this issue: 'The troops' presence is a two-edged sword. It helps on the one front and it doesn't help on the other.' That is classic Beazley.At one point the Labor Party were accusing the government of misleading the public, that we had misled the public back in October 2004 on the troop deployments, and the next moment they say we are making policy on the run. You cannot be doing both. We cannot have been making a decision back before October 2004 and be making policy on the run today.The Labor Party says we should bring our troops back from Iraq because we have a need for them in South-East Asia. Who has invited our troops into South-East Asia at the moment? The Leader of the Opposition says we need to put investment into maritime security in South-East Asia but that we should leave the Navy in the Persian Gulf and bring the troops back - what, for maritime security in South-East Asia? If I may say so, the argument of the Leader of the Opposition is deeply confusing. The opposition says we should provide more humanitarian assistance to Iraq - in other words, that we should send more civilians into Iraq unarmed but that we should not be providing support to the Japanese, who are doing humanitarian work in Iraq.The Leader of the Opposition claims to be some sort of global expert on international security issues. He has managed to convince some people on the political Left in this country of the truth of that but, when it comes to a significant issue like this, he is unable to put together a single coherent argument. The Labor Party have had, since March last year, 17 different policies on the issue of Iraq. They went into the Christmas period saying that over Christmas they would consult - they would consult with the United Nations, they would consult with the Iraqis and they would consult with the Americans - and then when they came back after Christmas they would have a new policy. It is 121 days since the member for Griffith said he would consult, and he has not consulted - or, if he has consulted, we would be delighted to hear the conclusions of those consultations. But, ultimately, what is the most fascinating political aspect of this issue - not the greatest issue of substance but the most interesting political issue - is that on this issue the Leader of the Opposition characteristically cannot make up his mind.</DOC>

 - Let me start by saying that, after our almost nine years in office, the Australian people had an opportunity only a few months ago to make a judgment about who they would trust with the stewardship of their economic future, and I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that on that occasion they did choose the government. Whether they choose the government in the future will be a matter of the government's performance and also the performance of the opposition. But let me go directly to the substance of the first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question: yes, it is true that foreign debt is higher now than it was in 1995 - of course it is. It is also true that in 1995 this country had a huge budget deficit, something that the then Minister for Finance denied. The then finance minister is now, of course, the Leader of the Opposition. The country had higher interest rates than it has now, it had much higher unemployment, it had lower levels of business investment; and the overall international assessment of the Australian economy in September 1995 was much gloomier than the assessments that have recently been made by bodies such as the IMF and the OECD.Also let me say that the government in 1995 - because it was a borrower, because it was running large deficits - was making a contribution to the savings difficulties that the country had whereas now it is a net public saver because we run budget surpluses. The government is in fact acting to ameliorate the situation. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that every attempt that the newly elected government in 1996 made to correct the economic difficulties we inherited he tried to block. I cannot think of a single corrective measure for the fiscal position of this country that the Leader of the Opposition supported when he was previously the Leader of the Opposition. He was perfectly happy to leave us with the double whammy: he was perfectly happy as finance minister to leave us with a huge deficit and he was perfectly happy as the Leader of the Opposition to then do everything in his power to prevent us correcting that deficit.The Leader of the Opposition can ask any questions he likes about what was said in 1995. I remember 1995 very well and so do 19 million to 20 million Australians. At that time, we had a government that 19 million Australians were desperate to get rid of, and they gave effect to their passion on 2 March 1996. They threw out the Keating-Beazley government in 1996, and I believe that, if his performance to date is any guide, they will throw out the Beazley opposition at the next available opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his very good question. I can confirm to the House that this government will provide free chickenpox vaccine to infants turning 18 months, and there will be a free catch-up program for children under 13 who have not yet had this illness. I can inform the House that in the past two years for which we have figures some 19 people died and some 3,300 people were hospitalised from chickenpox. The initiative announced today will save many parents the $70 that it costs to have their children privately vaccinated.I am very proud to defend the government's record on vaccination. In 1996, the Commonwealth government spent just $13 million on vaccines. As a result of the measures announced today, it is estimated that in the next financial year the Howard government will spend $286 million on vaccines - a 22-fold increase on the 1996 figure. Thanks to the policies of this government, childhood immunisation rates, which were languishing at just 50 per cent in the early 1990s, are now well above 90 per cent and are the envy of the world. These initiatives demonstrate that you can trust the Howard government with the health system of this country. You can rely on the Howard government to make a very good system even better.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the member for Hotham's question is no. Obviously the premise he bases the earlier assertion on is the fact that, if Labor were still in office, the Australian economy would be nowhere near as strong as it is now; therefore, not requiring the inputs and the investments in business that have taken place in recent years. I also point out to the member for Hotham that exports rose $11.7 billion in 2004 to $152.5 billion. In 1996, when we took office from Labor, it was $99 billion. We should also recognise the significant growth in the economy that has taken place over those eight or nine years. The economy of Australia is much larger today than it was then. It is interesting to note that, a couple of years ago, we had a major drought in Australia that had a significant effect on our productive capability and therefore our export effort as far as our agricultural exports were concerned. - At the same time the advent of the SARS epidemic in East Asia had an impact on demand for our exports in that region, and our exports dipped a little to $147 billion. They are now back up to $152½ billion. Only once before in the history of Australia have they been higher than that. That was in 2000-01, when they were $153 billion. The forecasts are that they will grow during the next couple of years. The government is maintaining a strong economic base in Australia that puts our export producers in a much better shape to compete with the world. Over those eight years, we have implemented policies of industrial relations reforms in this country, with more to come, that make our producers, our manufacturers and our exporters more efficient and more competitive. We have embarked upon an external trade policy of opening up markets, where we can and when we can, to provide more opportunities for Australia's exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I can inform him and honourable members that the government's reforms of the workplace relations system, particularly through the Workplace Relations Act 1996, have led to real benefits for Australian people - for example, increases in real wages since 1996 are at 12.2 per cent compared to just 1.2 per cent between 1983 and 1996. We have the lowest unemployment rate in Australia for some 28 years and we have the lowest levels of industrial disputes since records were first kept, which was at the time of the First World War. The changes to the workplace relations laws and to the system in Australia have been crucial to these outcomes for Australian people, yet every major reform in this area since 1996 has been staunchly opposed by the Australian Labor Party. I was surprised therefore today to read a piece by the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian newspaper in which he said: An industrial relations system that has produced high productivity growth, moderate wage outcomes, low strike levels and record corporate profits does not need radical change. 
There are two conclusions one can draw from what the Leader of the Opposition said. Firstly, we now hear belatedly from the Leader of the Opposition that the reforms which the Labor Party have staunchly opposed since 1996 have had these great outcomes for the Australian economy. Secondly, if the Leader of the Opposition is saying that the system does not need radical change - as he is quoted in the Australian as saying - will he now update his party's industrial relations platform, because the Labor Party's industrial relations platform effectively calls for the dismantling of the reforms that have been put in place since 1996? Two weeks ago, the member for Perth, the opposition spokesman in this area, was asked this question:Will we see any change of Labor's position now that Kim Beazley is back in leadership? And IR specifically?Mr Smith's reply was:Well - I don't necessarily think the change in leadership will bring any change in approach to bear.The Leader of the Opposition today has finally conceded that the Howard government's reforms of industrial relations have worked and yet his policy is still to dismantle it. Why doesn't he get up to date?</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Lalor a couple of things. The first is that in asking that question she deliberately omits to acknowledge the impact on private health insurance premiums of a number of government policies: not only the 30 per cent rebate but also Lifetime Health Cover. She also neglects to acknowledge the contributions that private health insurance makes to taking the load off the public hospital sector. Professor Ian Harper of the University of Melbourne has found that every dollar spent on the 30 per cent rebate saves $2 in government health spending.The member for Lalor is concerned about the impact on typical families. If a 30 per cent rebate were removed - which was certainly Labor's policy in 1998 when it was introduced, because they voted against it and, if it had not been for the courageous support of Senator Harradine in the other place, the measure would never have got through - there would be an increase of $800 a year to maintain private health insurance by typical families. I remind the House, while I am on the subject of rebates, that the Labor Party's negative response to the proposal to increase the premium for people over the ages of 65 and 70 is another reminder of how the Labor Party in practice is pursuing policies that would add to the cost of private health insurance for elderly Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler not only for his question but for his great hospitality last Friday when I accompanied him to the opening of one of Australia's great resource projects, the $1.5 billion project in Gladstone for Comalco's alumina refinery, for which the federal government provided assistance to Comalco to build a cogeneration plant. That is another example of federal government support for infrastructure, bringing home the bacon.That is not the only example of resource development and expansion in Australia. In 2004-05 the resource sector's exports are expected to increase by 20 per cent, or around $12 billion. Three commodities alone will lead the way: iron ore, up 35 per cent; metallurgical coal, up 52 per cent; thermal coal, up 43 per cent. But the best news is still to come. If we look out to 2005-06 we will see increases in exports of some 22 per cent, or the value of resource exports being worth some $82 billion. Again, coal will lead the way. Export earnings from coking coal are expected to increase 70 per cent to $18 billion in 2005-06, and thermal coal will increase 19 per cent to $7.4 billion.I have been asked about threats. It will be no surprise to this House that the threats to export growth come from the Labor Party. In this case the threat to the growth comes from the Beattie government, which has made a complete bungle of the Dalrymple Bay lease. I know that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that the solution for the Labor Party - perhaps he owes Premier Beattie yet another favour - is for the federal government to throw in some $400 million. In fact he said so the other day. But this government does not run deficit budgets the way the Labor Party ran deficit budgets when the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister. We believe that the people who make the mistakes should fix the mistakes.I thought to myself that perhaps I should check with the state Labor Treasurer who ran surplus budgets at about the same time as the Leader of the Opposition, then finance minister, was involved in a government that was running deficit budgets. I checked to see what the former Treasurer for Queensland, Keith De Lacy, said of the company of which he is chairman - Macarthur Coal. He said:Out of the eight projects that we're looking at, six of those are metallurgical projects in the northern Bowen Basin, but we've had to put them on hold until we can secure extra throughput through Dalrymple Bay. - I am asked a question by the member for Hunter, who used to be the spokesman for resources - but I see that he has been moved on. I think I should seek Mr De Lacy's solution. He is up there, he is involved, he knows the answers, and this is what he says: But we stress that both Prime - the company that has the lease on the loader -  
the authority - the competition authority in Queensland - and the Queensland government need to sit down together and find a way through this. It was the Queensland government's decision to privatise Dalrymple Bay _I could not agree more with that, and I can only urge the Leader of the Opposition to stay out of the way.</DOC>

 - The assertion on which that question is based is wrong - that is, the claim, which was echoed by the Leader of the Opposition this morning, that the federal government has not matched state increases in funding for vocational education between 1997 and 2003. That is just wrong. Overall, the states increased VET funding by 21.3 per cent over this period - and I am using the figures of the Leader of the Opposition. The Commonwealth government has increased overall vocational education and training funding by 35.5 per cent over the same period. Can I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that new apprentices in training have increased from 143,000 in 1995 to 393,800 in September 2004. Can I also remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is so fond of trumpeting the virtues of state Labor governments, that the most notorious blow that has been struck to the prospects of young trainees in Australia was the 200 per cent to 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees implemented by a large number of state governments.The coalition has allocated over $1 billion in new funding for vocational education and training over the next three years, one of the most significant boosts by any government in years. This year the federal government will spend $2.1 billion on vocational education and training. By contrast, the states and territories have been cutting their training budgets. I repeat: they have been cutting their training budgets - New South Wales by 2.4 per cent in real terms, Western Australia by 2.1 per cent and the Northern Territory by 5.2 per cent. In real terms, the Commonwealth government has lifted funding for training by 22 per cent since 1995. Figures released last week by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that commencements in traditional trades increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months to September 2004, completions are up 11 per cent on the previous year and school based new apprenticeship commencements rose by 52 per cent in the year to September 2004. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the number of new apprentices in training fell to an all-time low of 122,700 compared to 393,800 today.Skills shortages are a product of a strong economy and low unemployment. Let me repeat something that I said in an interview yesterday. We are paying the price now for, I think, a generation of attitudes in this country which basically said that if you wanted to get ahead in life you should go to year 12 and go on to university. Going into a trade was denigrated by too many people, including parents. This is not the fault of one or the other side of politics; it is a judgment on attitudes that existed. But one criticism that I certainly will not wear, and which cannot be sustained by any kind of objective analysis, is that this government, in the years it has been in office, has neglected training. The figures that I have just given to the House give the lie to that. -  - The noisy interjections from the other side vindicate the accuracy of the figures that I have quoted. We have not cut funding; we have lifted funding. We have more than matched the states. We have presided over a dramatic increase in the number of apprentices in this country, and the figures we have today, compared to the figures presided over by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister, should leave that gentleman hanging his head in shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for the question, because I think many members are aware of the importance of volunteers. I know in the member for Lindsay's electorate, as in mine, we often face the hazard of bushfires and we rely very heavily upon the rural fire services as well as organisations like the state emergency services. We do rely very heavily on the commitment of volunteers right around Australia. We know that something of the order of half a million people are involved in volunteering their services in some form of emergency management capacity and 350,000 of those are involved in emergency first response. We need to keep this commitment going. We need to ensure that the all-hazards approach that we take to deal with emergencies is ably supported by a band of willing and well-supported volunteers.Last week, I chaired the inaugural meeting of all state and territory ministers who have responsibility for emergency services, and it was an opportunity to progress some of the initiatives that the Commonwealth is pursuing. In particular, it focused on tangible ways of enhancing the emergency service volunteer base and underscored the importance of the commitment made by the coalition of $49 million over time in its Working Together to Manage Emergencies policy announced at the last election. When implemented, that will provide an opportunity for local authorities to obtain grants to directly assist volunteer organisations.I am very interested in alternative policies in relation to these matters, particularly where volunteers are concerned, and I have looked closely to see where alternative policies might come from. I must say during the course of the last election I could not find any alternative policies being presented by the opposition, which made me interested in a statement from the member for Barton that, when the coalition was dealing with these issues, he seemed to become aware of the importance of volunteers. But his approach was to simply encourage the Commonwealth to endorse a proposal from the states for a national taxation rebate for emergency service volunteers. I have not asked the Treasurer whether he would like to cost such an item but, if the opposition are going to find policies in this area, let them also recognise what resources are involved and argue tangibly what policies they have in mind and the costs that they are prepared to attach to them. - No, I was reading from a press release from the honourable member for Barton, and it does say the 'territory ministers will seek endorsement from the Commonwealth,' which is the quote I made. I present the document.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that entirely surprising and completely unpredictable question. Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the Leader of the Opposition that it is no surprise that the tax take this year should be higher than it was in 1996, because obviously we have more people; they are paid higher wages; and they pay more tax. That is the first remark I would make. The second observation I would make is that I reject entirely the proposition that this government has not invested in skills. That is an issue that will be developed further, no doubt, as question time unfolds. Finally, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that he is the last person in this chamber to give anybody else lectures on fiscal rectitude.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member for Kingston that, as a result of some very careful research in my office, we have come across a claim being made by the opposition that we are irresponsibly spending $66 billion. After I had this drawn to my attention, I decided to do a little bit of research as to how you would arrive at $66 billion. It throws up some very interesting issues. Of course I assume that when an opposition says that a government is irresponsibly spending $66 billion it is against the expenditure of that $66 billion.I assume that is a reasonable proposition for that whole $66 billion. I assume that, if Labor had won the election, the Labor Party would have rescinded all of those commitments because they were irresponsible. So I decided to go through it, and I found that $21 billion of that $66 billion was increased assistance for Australian families. In other words, a third of the $66 billion represents the increased assistance for Australian families that was announced in the last budget. It also includes those very real supplements of $600 each. I know the Labor Party argued they did not exist. But I now have to tell them they do exist and the Australian families who received them demonstrated last October that they thought they existed.But let us go on. There is $14.7 billion in personal income tax cuts. If I remember correctly, the Labor Party allowed those to go through in the Senate. There is $2.1 billion of investment in Australian aged care facilities. Is Labor saying that we should rip $2.1 billion out of aged care facilities? There is $3.3 billion of extra funding to strengthen Medicare - and in the words of my colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing - demonstrating that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.But the list goes on: a $400 million enhancement to the private health insurance rebate; $2.4 billion of funds going to AusLink; $2 billion of investment in science and innovation; $2.5 billion has gone into defence and national security - presumably this great defence buff who now leads the opposition would want us to rip $2.5 billion out of defence and national security; $1 billion worth of tax relief provided to mature age workers; and a further $1 billion of tax relief for small business. -  - Yes, a billion dollars help for small business. We are going to rip that out of small business! Listen to this. Can you believe this is something else they are opposed to: $900 million of assistance to pensioners and self-funded retirees to help with their utility payments. How mean can you possibly get! But it gets worse. There is no group in the community for which there ought to be more regard and respect than the carers of Australia. That $66 billion involves $500 million of help for Australia's carers. It also includes $2.5 billion in superannuation incentives and $1.6 billion to the Australian water fund. But, relevant to this discussion, here is the most interesting component of all: it also includes $1 billion for vocational education and training. Yet only two days ago, here in Canberra on 6 March, these were the very words of the Leader of the Opposition:They'll spend $66 billion on getting themselves re-elected but they'll not spend $1 billion on getting young Australians skilled.In other words, not only has he been caught out in the absurdity of attacking spending on things that he voted for but included in that $66 billion is in fact a $1 billion investment in the very thing he said was excluded from the $66 billion. I have said it before, and I will say it again, that the man who sits opposite me is a prime example of somebody who tries to walk both sides of the street. On this occasion he has well and truly been exposed for the humbug he is on expenditure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House now know that this year is the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and that there is going to be a particular focus on the Anzac Day ceremonies at Gallipoli. There have been some media reports - I think in the Daily Telegraph and possibly on one of the commercial stations - about the rebuilding of an existing road around Anzac Cove. This road is being rebuilt for safety reasons. There is no question that the road does require some urgent reinforcing, and the Turkish authorities are endeavouring to complete the road in time for the 90th anniversary commemorations.On seeing the media reports I instructed our Ambassador to Turkey, Jean Dunn, to raise with the Turkish government the issues that had been raised in the media reports because, obviously for all of us, the site is of enormous historical and emotional importance and it would be of very great concern to us if the remains of fallen soldiers were being disturbed and dirt was being dumped onto the beach at Anzac Cove. During the course of the discussions yesterday, the Turkish authorities told our ambassador that archaeological work had been carried out prior to the roadworks commencing and that no remains have been unearthed during the roadworks. They also assured us that if any remains were unearthed they would immediately instruct that the reconstruction of the road be stopped. We appreciate that very much. I must say I very much appreciate the sensitivity with which the Turkish authorities responded to our representations. It is true that the contractors have put some earth onto the beach at Anzac Cove. The Turkish government is instructing the contractors to remove that earth from the beach so the beach can be restored to its proper condition.In conclusion, I think all members of the House would appreciate the job that the Turkish authorities have done in protecting Anzac Cove and the surrounding national park and the enormous efforts they make to make the Anzac Day ceremonies there a success. I know tens of thousands - probably hundreds of thousands - of Australians have benefited from the work that the Turks have done. Very recently we had the Governor of Canakkale here. Some members will have met him; I did. Canakkale is the province within which Gallipoli resides. I took the opportunity in my meeting with him to thank him very warmly for all that the Turkish authorities are doing. From the ambassador's discussions with the Turkish authorities I am satisfied that they are very aware of our concerns, they are aware of the media reports and they will take all necessary steps - as they have done for many, many years - to protect the dignity of the site.</DOC>

 - I will take the last part of the question and repeat again: no promises have been broken. Let me go back to the first part of the question. I have no doubt that I did say something to that effect, and those remarks would have been made in the context of the fiscal conditions of 1996. In February 1996, the person who has just asked me the question was busily misleading the Australian people by saying the budget was in surplus. We knew otherwise, and those remarks were made in the context of having not only a current account deficit but also a very large budget deficit. The reason the current account deficit now and the consequent size of foreign debt is serviceable and manageable in a way it was not in 1996 is that we have got the budget back into surplus. The government is therefore not subtracting from public savings. We have been able to do that whilst being able to invest sensibly in services for the Australian people and also to provide taxation relief which, according to the Labor Party in recent weeks, we should not have been doing. In those circumstances, I feel no discomfort at all about being reminded of that remark.</DOC>

 - It is a great pleasure to outline to the people of Ryan and the people of Australia the parameters for the upcoming budget. The government's midyear review forecasts a surplus of $6.2 billion in this current financial year. It is important that the government run a surplus because, at a time when individuals are borrowing and at a time when we expect businesses to actually be investing, it is only the government that will be adding to savings and it will be business and individuals that will be running down savings. So it is important that the government runs surplus budgets.Up until this morning, I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough, but I read in the Sydney Morning Herald today some criticism that they might be too large. Can I just say the government will not be entering into the business, pre-budget, of confirming or denying any particular stories which journalists intend to write, because it puts the government in an impossible position. The government will outline and update the position at the time of the budget. But, as I said, until this morning I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough. That was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by Professor Ross Garnaut in his Sir Leslie Melville lecture, and it was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by an interviewee on the John Laws program last week. It was quite spooky. We had someone go onto the John Laws program last week and excite members of the press gallery by giving the government some advice. This spooky commentator seems to be Labor's modern economic spokesman - he has been rediscovered. The spokesman was no other than Paul Keating, who went on the John Laws program on 2 March 2005 and said this: 'I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus.'For the record, as Treasurer, Mr Keating did eight budgets; as Prime Minister, four. Labor was in office for 13 years. This government has done nine budgets, and the cash balances of those nine budgets have been a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP. The cash surpluses of the 13 years of Keating economic management were minus 20.2 per cent of GDP. And there he was in a spooky interview on the John Laws program last week - 'I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus'!We have been getting the same kinds of lectures from the Leader of the Opposition, who has been out complaining that the government has had unsustainable tax cuts and unsustainable expenditures. The Prime Minister reminded us the last time the Leader of the Opposition promised Australia it had a budget in surplus he missed by $10,000 million. We will start taking advice from the Leader of the Opposition on budget deficits when we start getting our marriage guidance counselling from Elizabeth Taylor! That is when we will be doing that.We then had the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer who up until today has also been criticising $66 billion in tax cuts and family payments, go out there today and be asked what should happen and he says:... we desperately need investment in skills development - that is more spending - ... we desperately need some incentive in the tax system - that is more tax cuts. What is the Labor Party's answer? Attack the government for tax cuts and spending and then demand more spending and more tax cuts. This even makes me pine for the days when the member for Hotham was the shadow Treasurer.Why do they do this? Because when these ALP state secretaries go to the white bread training school they are told that whatever the issue is either it is too much spending or, if it is not too much spending, it should be too little spending. It is either too much tax or too much in tax cuts. But at the bottom of the day it is empty, vacuous, platitudinous and self-contradictory from people who have not done the work, do not understand the issues and cannot make a contribution. So I finish with a last word on this subject from Alex Sanchez. Remember him? He used to sit over there in the box last year advising the member for Werriwa. -  - He is looking for a policy in there. But it is empty. This is what Alex Sanchez said:What is Labor's response ... Return to Hawke and Keating and use it as a curtain to disguise an empty policy cupboard.Right there! Right in the box which he opened up, as vacuous as the policies of the member for Lilley.</DOC>

 - Unlike the attitude taken by my predecessor and many of those around him at the time, of course I accept ultimate and full responsibility for the state of the Australian economy under the stewardship of my government. I accept full responsibility and I am proud to do so. I am proud to take responsibility for what my government has done, with the very able and special contribution of the Treasurer, to bring to the government of this country. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question. I am proud of the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. I am proud of the fact that, when the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia goes overseas, he is told by other central bank governors that he is the envy of the Western world because of the tight fiscal policy that this government runs. I am proud of the fact that in the years I have been Prime Minister we have provided more choice for Australian families. I am proud of the fact that the opportunities for Australian women have been greatly advanced since 1996. I am also proud of the fact that we have rebalanced Australia's foreign policy and security approaches.I am not ashamed of anything that this government has done in the management of the Australian economy. We have delivered to the working men and women of Australia. We have delivered to the blue-collar workers of Australia, a group that the Leader of the Opposition was talking about this morning, the quadrella of historically low interest rates; increases in their real wages - 13 per cent versus one per cent in the 13 barren years of Hawke and Keating; tax cuts; and the opportunity for their children to have jobs that in the previous generation they did not have. I am proud of that and I take full responsibility for it.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the government will extend Medicare funding to 21 new MRI machines, on top of the three new MRI machines promised during the election campaign. I know that the member for Solomon will be pleased to know that there will be new Medicare funded MRI machines at Darwin, Bunbury, Bendigo, Gippsland, Dubbo, Lismore, Toowoomba, Rockhampton and Mackay as well as at 15 metropolitan locations. I am also pleased to say that 11 of the 21 new machines announced the other week will be in public hospitals.In1996 there were just 18 Medicare funded MRI machines. Soon there will be 101 Medicare funded MRI machines, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. But there is more good news from the Howard government: all of the new machines will bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders and 15 of the new machines will bulk-bill every single patient. All of this demonstrates that you can trust the Howard government with Australia's health system. As everyone knows, the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. We will do what is necessary to make a very good system even better.</DOC>

 - The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now that I have had an opportunity to examine the Skills at Work report released yesterday, that there has been a strong growth in new apprenticeships in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors in response to rapid expansion of employment in those sectors, and that the number of apprentices commencing a trade apprenticeship increased 32 per cent between 1996 and 2003. The report also shows that 90 per cent of new apprentices have ongoing employment within three months of completing their apprenticeships. Figures released last week by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that commencements in traditional trades - and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was surely talking about a traditional trade if she was talking about the building industry - have increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months to September 2004. So the question of whether, over a particular period of time, there is a rise or fall in renovations is influenced by a variety of factors but it does not merit the wholly misleading and dishonest description of a 'skills crisis'.</DOC>

 - Let me thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and his interest. The process now is that the transitional assembly is to meet and a transitional government is to be formed by that transitional assembly. Interim Deputy Prime Minister Salih said the Transitional National Assembly would meet on 16 March. The reason 16 March was chosen is that it is the anniversary of the chemical weapons attack against Halabja by Saddam Hussein. So it is a very symbolic day. It is a very important day for the Iraqis and it is a symbol of reconciliation in that country. A two-thirds majority will be required in the National Assembly to elect a president and two vice presidents, who will in turn appoint a prime minister. That process is, of course, under way already and it is very encouraging to see this democracy at work.What is also encouraging is that there is now international consensus. President Bush's visit to Europe illustrated that point only too clearly. The international community is getting right behind the Iraqis in trying to ensure that the new democratic Iraq works. I was quite interested to see that amongst those who were virulently opposed to the original overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a British Labour MP called Harry Barnes. Some members opposite may know Harry Barnes. Having been a very passionate anti-war MP, he has now done the honourable thing. He has set up a group called Labour Friends of Iraq. I would like to feel that our own Labor Party could think about Labor friends of Iraq as well, and take a leaf out of Harry Barnes's book. Harry Barnes said:I thought it was right to oppose the war. But history moves on and the Iraqi people now have a golden opportunity to take back their country and build a decent non-sectarian democracy ...Here you have the British Labour Party, even the anti-war dissidents within the government majority there, getting behind the people of Iraq. Just about the only people left who are continually harping on in a negative way about Iraq are the Australian Labor Party led by the current Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition made an 18-minute speech. It was another simple illustration of his capacity to walk both sides of the street. It was a speech where he said nothing positive about the Iraqi election. I think the only thing he said about the election was that he thought it was flawed.The European Union, the NATO leaders and the international community all know that the Sunnis were intimidated in order to keep the turnout low, but we are being positive and constructive about the future of democracy in Iraq. The Leader of the Opposition apparently thinks that the real issue here is that the country is about to descend into a civil war. So let's talk up that issue. He walks both sides of the street. He said, in terms of Australia's contribution, that he thinks the maintenance of a strong position in the Persian Gulf is not an unreasonable thing on a more long-term basis. So we should have people - the Navy, I suppose - in the Persian Gulf in the long term.But the Leader of the Opposition also said in the same speech that we should not commit ourselves permanently outside of the Asia-Pacific region. We should have the Navy there but we should not have the Army there! We should be there; we should not be there! He had a new criticism which was that when the al-Sadr forces were in revolt there was a need to increase our deployment in Iraq. But with Iraq so much quieter now he thinks that we should have increased our troop numbers earlier. And maybe having increased them earlier we should reduce them. He makes the argument that we do not have enough troops there - 450 is not enough! We need more troops there but we should not have troops there at all! I think the Labor Party in Australia should follow the lead of Harry Barnes. They should get behind the Iraqi people, set up a new group called 'Labor friends for Iraq' - not 'Gough Whitlam in Blues Point Tower friends for Iraq' - and get behind the Iraqi people and support democracy. On this side of the House that is what we do.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the role of the troops will be as I outlined in the House yesterday. I heard on AM this morning the remarks made by the Japanese officer. I also heard the remarks of the Chief of the Defence Force that came immediately afterwards and properly explained, in a way I thought even the Leader of the Opposition might understand, very plainly the role of our forces. So far as the equipment and force protection are concerned, the advice of the Defence experts is that the equipment they have will be appropriate to the task. Given the interest of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton in these matters, if there is anything additional of a confidential nature they would like to know, I am very happy to make it available. But they would both appreciate that there are some operational reasons why we do not go into all of the defensive and protective material that is made available.It is self-evident that the role of the ADF will not precisely replace the role of the Dutch, for reasons that were outlined by the British commander, I think, in the same interview this morning, when he said there had been a significant improvement in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to look after themselves and their fellow Iraqis brought about by something the Labor Party continues to oppose - that is, the role of the coalition in training the Iraqis. Here we have this impossible contradiction in the position of the Leader of the Opposition. He says that the imperative is to have an exit strategy - the imperative is to tell the Australian people when we are leaving - but he opposes the means whereby we can leave the Iraqis safely in charge of their own security. It is not possible to have an effective coalition withdrawal from Iraq until the Iraqis are able to look after their internal and external security. Yet the Labor Party opposes us providing that. It is the ultimate example of the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition to walk both sides of the street on an important issue of national security.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is working very hard and sits up straight and pays attention for Braddon. Of course, we visited Caterpillar Elphinstone last week. They have 627 employees and 93 apprentices, and they would take a lot more tomorrow if they could. Since this government came to office, the number of apprentices in this country has increased from 146,000 to almost 400,000. In fact, in the 18 months that the Leader of the Opposition was the minister in the government responsible for training, the number of apprentices in traditional trades dropped from 143,000 to 107,000. As he told his biographer, he did not find education and training particularly 'straining'.This government is investing, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, $2.1 billion this year alone in training. Of those 400,000 apprentices, 148,000 are in traditional trades. That represents 38 per cent of all apprentices in Australia in traditional trades despite the fact that traditional trades are 13 per cent of the labour market. In the election campaign this government announced, as the Prime Minister said today, more than $1 billion of extra funding to support apprentices over the next four years. That includes $91 million for scholarships for apprentices. If people going to university can get a scholarship, why can't a young bloke who is going to be a plumber or a tiler? This government will deliver a $500 cash payment at the end of year one and another $500 at the end of year two. There is another $75 million, opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, for tool boxes. The Leader of the Opposition laughs at tool boxes. Commencing from 1 July, the government will deliver $800 for a tool box and tools for an apprentice three months into their apprenticeship. There are another 27,000 training places for school based apprentices and young and not so young people that need a bit of training before they start their apprenticeship.The other rock I have been looking under is careers advice. I have discovered that not everybody who is offering careers advice to young people is well trained. There will be another $103 million delivered to improve the quality of careers advice given to children in schools.I am also asked about alternative policies. Let us remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has just asked the Prime Minister a question, that, in the last parliament, at question time - question time is where the opposition defines its priorities - 59 questions on universities and five questions on training were asked of me, and in only one question was the word 'apprentice' even mentioned. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition delivered Labor's manifesto to the ACTU congress in August 2003 - that is, Labor's platform on education on training - there were 27 mentions of universities, six mentions of TAFE and two mentions of training. How many mentions of apprenticeships were there? None. How much priority does the Labor Party place on apprenticeships? Zero.In terms of policies, the Labor Party needs to understand that the state governments, which run the TAFEs, last year cut 1,200 training places out of the automotive sector and 1,300 places out of utilities, mining and construction. You know what they have replaced them with? You can do feng shui - the member for Griffith would love that. There is fruit carving for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The member for Port Adelaide would be concerned to know you can do rave party management. For the Leader of the Opposition - there is a course for everybody in the Labor Party - there is belly dancing for beginners. What Australia needs is more brickies and fewer belly dancers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his important role in chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. As the member for Deakin knows, the Cole royal commission found an unassailable case for the reform of the building and construction industry in Australia. Justice Cole found an industry characterised by a culture of intimidation and unlawful behaviour.I can inform the House that tomorrow I will be introducing the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. This bill will do two things in particular: firstly, it will increase the penalty provisions in the Workplace Relations Act and, secondly, it will finally give the building industry task force the powers it needs to effectively prosecute illegal activity. This bill is intended to send a clear message to employers and unions that the government is serious about taking action in relation to what Justice Cole found in the building and construction industry. For those in the industry who may be contemplating taking unlawful action, it will act as a powerful deterrent. The increased penalties are up to a maximum of $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 in other cases.It is unacceptable that people in this industry should continue to act outside the law. No responsible government could turn a blind eye to the problems that exist in the building and construction industry in Australia. Yet I have to report that this is exactly what the opposition has done. The Labor Party's current workplace relations platform - written, I remind the House, by an ALP conference at which 50 per cent of the votes belonged to the unions - compels the Labor Party to vote against this law. This platform is binding on ALP members of parliament. It also states:It reaffirms the strong bonds between the trade union movement and the parliamentary Labor parties in Australia.At this very time, we have the CFMEU threatening major industrial disputation to exploit the privileged position which it currently has. It is not about the interests of its members; it is simply about shoring up its power before the government's reforms come into operation. Yesterday, the Western Australian state assistant secretary, Joe McDonald, promised:... the biggest stoush that I have seen in my time, and I have seen some major ones.The CFMEU is the union which has donated over $4.9 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1995-96. And it is the union which is pulling the strings of the Australia Labor Party, who will not do anything about the culture of lawlessness and intimidation which exists in the building and construction industry. - The interjection from the other side simply proves the point.</DOC>

This service has been funded by the federal government to the tune of about $1 million a year. I understand that this funding will shortly run out. I believe that the service has been strongly and unsuccessfully lobbying the state government for additional funding. I have no desire to see the service close. I do have every desire to see the service work effectively and efficiently. It is my expectation that my colleague the parliamentary secretary will shortly be in a position to make an announcement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his ongoing commitment to the resources sector, particularly in his own seat and in the Gladstone region. Of course, it is the resources sector that is driving Australia's economy through a major export contribution this year alone of $53 billion. In as little as two years, that will rise to $82 billion, and going with that is a very significant ongoing commitment to resource infrastructure development that ensures that we as a government will continue to provide a strong future for the resources sector. Here are just a few examples: a $102 million interest-free loan to Comalco to put in place a co-generation plant in the city of Gladstone; $125 million to construct multi-user infrastructure such as water recycling and air separation facilities in Western Australia - probably not far from Brand, in the area of Kwinana; and $10 million to Queensland Alumina to assist them in their conversion from coal to natural gas, underpinning the development of the PNG gas pipeline into Queensland and eastern Australia. As well as all of those, there have been literally hundreds of millions of dollars put into developments such as those on the Burrup Peninsula and in other areas within Australia. - All these funds have been put forward to encourage investment of footloose projects here in Australia, footloose projects that will come here rather than go to another country. These investments, this infrastructure, these jobs and this future for Australia would not have existed under the Labor Party because they want to abolish the very agency, Invest Australia, that is behind attracting these investments here and arranging for their funding. - They can sit there and make their comments; the reality is that their policy is not to have investment here. This government continues to target its infrastructure spending on projects with solid private sector backing - real value for the Commonwealth taxpayers' dollar. Nothing could be more different from what a Labor government would do. The Beattie government is one case in point at the moment - a classic example of what a mess the Labor Party makes when it tries to invest in infrastructure. I read today that Macarthur Coal have been forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay, the port that was privatised by the Queensland government - the Beattie government. They were forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay and the 40-ship queue waiting offshore because the Beattie government made a mess of that lease. The reality is that the Labor Party, whether it is in state government or federal government, makes a mess of its investment in infrastructure. Peter Beattie may be looking around for someone to blame but, as I said in the House yesterday, he does not have to look very far. He can look to an old colleague Keith DeLacey. Keith said quite graphically, 'It was the Queensland government's decision to privatise Dalrymple Bay coal terminal.' The Labor Party continues to make a mess of infrastructure investment while this government has a proud record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I am interested that she asks me a question today, on International Women's Day, about violence against Indigenous women. I want to make it very clear that violence against women in our community is never acceptable, but the tragedy and reality is that Indigenous women in Indigenous communities are perhaps the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society. In terms of Indigenous family violence, the victims are almost always women and children. This government is resolute in its determination to address these issues of family violence, and as Attorney I want to empower victims of family violence by increasing their access to our judicial system, where they can obtain support and assistance.Recently I announced the location of seven new family violence units as part of a $22.7 million expansion of the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Program. Ultimately, this roll-out of new services will see the number of units doubled, from 13 to 26, across Australia. They will provide legal support for victims. I know that my colleagues who represent rural and remote communities will welcome the roll-out of these new legal services. They include Bourke, Rockhampton, the Kimberley region, Dubbo, Mildura, Geraldton and also the Northern Territory.These build on other initiatives that we are taking. They include appointing family consultants in Darwin, Alice Springs and Cairns to help Indigenous families access the courts, and funding of legal services specifically for Indigenous women through the women's legal services in each state and territory. We are also looking at ways to recognise the extended family role in raising children in Indigenous communities, and I hope to have something to say about that shortly. These initiatives indicate the government's very real and ongoing commitment to practical reconciliation and a better outcome for Indigenous Australians and Indigenous women and children in particular.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. So far as I recall, I made no representations on the matter. It is not inappropriate for any member to make representations on behalf of constituents. We have had representations from those opposite in support of Regional Partnerships programs. We have had representations from the Leader of the Opposition in support of Regional Partnerships programs - and I have not claimed in this place that it was illegitimate for him to do so. He claims that all Regional Partnerships programs should be scrapped except, of course, for those in Brand as he seeks to walk both sides of the street again. But I will check. So far as I recall, I made no representations.It is a flexible program that meets some very real needs. For example, it has approved funding for 239 rural transaction centres, which provide vital banking, postal, Centrelink and Medicare services. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would like to nominate which rural community should have missed out on face-to-face banking services.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, through you to the Leader of the Opposition, yes, I am aware of the consumer sentiment figures that came out today. They do record the fall that the Leader of the Opposition described. I point out to the House that the fall comes off a very high level for the index. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the index is still above the long-term average of the index. I have no doubt that this fall was due to the conjunction of three announcements: the interest rate rise, the current account deficit and the slowing in growth. That is a reminder of a self-evident truth - that is, good economic management is something that does not happen by chance or automatically; it is something that has to be worked at over a period of time. This is a reminder to everybody who can influence public opinion in this country that this is an occasion for talking commonsense about the economy and recognising the strengths of the economy - which include the lowest level of unemployment in 30 years, high levels of business investment and an extremely strong fiscal position. It also requires those who would seek to lead in the economic debate to show a bit of consistency - in other words, not to say one day that the government are spending too much, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, and then the next day say, through his Treasury spokesman, that we are not spending enough on a whole lot of areas.This Leader of the Opposition not only walks both sides of the street when it comes to Iraq, he also walks both sides of the street when it comes to the Australian economy. You cannot attack the government for spending too much and then the very next day attack the government for spending too little. Maybe you can do that, I correct myself, but the longer you do it and the more frequently you do it the more you undermine your own credibility and the more you render yourself irrelevant in terms of influencing Australian public opinion on the great economic debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index figures which were released today show a 16.6 per cent fall. That was off the third-highest measure of consumer sentiment ever recorded. The consequence of that is that consumer sentiment is still 1.2 per cent above the long-term average. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute release noted that this followed the announcement of a 0.25 per cent increase in the official cash rate and said as follows:It is an extraordinarily strong reaction by consumers to the rate hike.And obviously it is. The reaction itself of course will come as no surprise to the Reserve Bank because one of the reasons that the Reserve Bank took the decisions that it did was, as it said: 
Conditions prevailing in Australia and abroad are likely to continue to encourage spending growth in the period ahead.It went on to observe the high levels of confidence in the household sector. In other words, one of the reasons the Reserve Bank made the decision that it did was the abnormally high consumer sentiment. One of the reactions is to move that indicator and nobody, least of all the Reserve Bank, would be surprised by that response.Nothing in that survey means that there has been any marked shift in the underlying financial position of the household sector in Australia. Let me remind the House, household real disposable income has grown by 33 per cent since the government was elected in 1996. The real net wealth of households has doubled under this government, increasing at an annual average rate of 8.6 per cent since the election of this government. For every dollar of debt, households have around $2 in financial assets and more than $6 in total assets. Indeed, over the last nine years there has probably been the greatest build-up of wealth in this country - certainly this century and possibly since colonisation in Australia. So the sentiment does not affect the financial position of the household sector. The sentiment, as you would expect, changes. If we look very carefully at the Reserve Bank decision, it was probably one of the reasons that motivated it to take the decision that it did.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked me to nominate a rate. In fact, three rates come to my mind: 17 per cent for housing, 20 per cent for small business and 21 per cent if you happened to be an unfortunate farmer in the Hawke-Keating years. They are the three rates that most readily come to my mind. I saw the Treasurer's interview last night, and I thought that he did an extremely good job of comparing the performance of this government with monetary policy and the performance of those who sat opposite.The point the Treasurer has made - and I would repeat it - is that the interest rates we now have are historically low in the experience of this country. He has also made the point that in the time that we have been in government - and what counts is what you deliver in government, not the rhetorical exchanges that occur in public debate - we have delivered interest rates which have moved between six and eight per cent. In the time that the Hawke-Keating government was in office, it delivered rates that moved between 10 and 17 per cent. That is what the Australian people know, that is what the Australian people remember and that is what the Australian people had in mind when they factored interest rates into the calculations they made before they cast their vote on 9 October.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and for his interest. I know that, as a former member of the Australian Defence Force, he has a great deal of interest in these issues. I do not think there is any doubt that there has been a remarkable trend of events in recent times with the emergence of democracy in the Middle East, a part of the world where some had argued that democracy would not happen or that the people, in particular the Arab people, were not somehow suited to democracy. Recent events show how wrong that has been. In Afghanistan there were presidential elections in October last year - on the very same day, as a matter of fact, on which we had our own general election here in this country. It was a remarkably good day, 9 October 2004. In January 2005 there were presidential elections in the Palestinian territories. We see movements in the right direction towards democracy in Egypt and we see municipal elections in Saudi Arabia - the start of the emergence of democratic processes in that country. We have seen people power in Beirut, which has obliged the Syrians to at least begin to comply with United Nations Security Council resolution 1559. Maybe above all, from our perspective, we have seen the remarkable elections that took place in Iraq on 30 January, with nearly 60 per cent of people turning out to vote in the face of intimidation, oppression and terrorism.Without any doubt, one of the key factors that has led to this emergence of democracy - and it should not be overstated that this is the beginning, not the end - has been the liberation of Iraq from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. I know the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition want to downplay this, but those who live in the region understand this and understand it only too well. The Lebanese opposition leader, Walid Jumblatt, said the other day:I was cynical about Iraq, but when I saw the Iraqi people voting three weeks ago, eight million of them, it was the start of a new Arab world ...I notice that, on 8 March, Rupert Cornwell, who has been a constant critic of the Iraq war, wrote an article in the UK Independent newspaper with the headline, 'Was Bush right after all?' He said:As Syria pulls out of Lebanon, and the winds of change blow through the Middle East, this is the difficult question that opponents of the Iraq war are having to face.This is from one of the significant opponents of the war. Then, of course, as I mentioned yesterday, we have the redoubtable Harry Barnes, the British Labour MP who set up Labour Friends of Iraq. I gave advice to the opposition leader yesterday: I hope that a Labor friends of Iraq group is being set up here in this country as an equivalent of the organisation that Harry Barnes has set up in the UK and I remind the House that Harry Barnes said:I thought it was right to oppose the war. But history moves on and the Iraqi people now have a golden opportunity to take back their country and build a decent non-sectarian democracy ...We on this side of the House are very proud of the role that we and our armed forces have played in contributing to the momentous change that is moving through the Middle East. We are proud that, despite the political difficulties involved, we did the right thing and contributed to that emerging trend. - Let me pick up on what the Prime Minister has said. We applaud the courage of a lot of other people, and one of the people whose courage we applaud is Tony Blair. He had a Green Left sort of group in his party who opposed what he did, and he had the strength to stand up to them. I know the Leader of the Opposition reasonably well, and nobody would claim he is an opponent of democracy; of course he is not. But the Leader of the Opposition should get off the fence and come out and strongly state his support for the emerging democracy of Iraq - not equivocate, not quibble, not start rambling on about emerging civil war in Iraq. He should be out there positively championing democracy in Iraq. A leader with courage, like Tony Blair, would do that. That unfortunately is not the case with the leader of our own Labor Party.</DOC>

 - This is a very interesting question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let me get it right: what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is saying is that there is something wrong with encouraging apprenticeships in the entertainment and food provision industries. That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is saying. This is the new Labor snobbery: there is something shameful about a person who works for Hungry Jacks or McDonald's. There is something shameful about that. -  - Heavens above, Mr Speaker; this is the latest version of the new class to come from the Labor Party - this elite approach. What I said yesterday and what I would repeat is that, yes, there is a shortage of people in the traditional trades. That is something that was identified by me and by the coalition in the last election campaign, and we gave a greater priority to that issue in the last election campaign than did the Australian Labor Party. -  - If you look at the two policies, we had far more to say about addressing that issue than did the Australian Labor Party. I have never run away from the fact - and I would not - that there is a shortage of people in the traditional trades. But I said yesterday and I repeat again that I have absolutely no intention of embracing this absurd rhetoric - which is quite false, when you actually look at the increase that has occurred - that there is some kind of skills crisis. I certainly do not intend, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done, to sneer at young Australians who work for Hungry Jacks. - To treat them as second-class citizens and say that there is something dishonourable about the service sector of the Australian economy shows the new snobbery of the old Australian Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I would like to place on record the very great respect I have for the work that she has done, including with the private sector and the Pratt Foundation, in taking forward the policy framework for the management of Australia's water. She has made a very great contribution indeed.I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the states are returning to the fold and re-embracing the National Water Initiative. Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland have all indicated that they have recommitted to the National Water Initiative. In that sense, it is good to be able to record that sound public policy and a world-leading legal framework for the management of our water have again started to win out over some politics, if I can put it that way. The National Water Initiative is a national policy. I trust that Western Australia and Tasmania will take the time to consider the many advantages of being partners and that it is only a matter of time before the ACT and the Northern Territory climb back on board as well.One of the good aspects of this is that we can now press on with the Living Murray, which my colleagues the minister for agriculture and, in the Senate, the minister for the environment have both put so much leadership and so much work and effort into. It is a great national priority; there is no doubt about it. Again, we need to do it cooperatively given the nature of federalism in this country. It is very important that, over and above the national Water Fund of $2 billion, the Living Murray initiative, which is worth some $500 million initially, can now proceed.The National Water Commission has been established. As I think is known, Ken Matthews is the chief executive officer. The remaining commissioners - three to be selected by the Australian government, three to be selected by the states and territories and a chair to be appointed in consultation with the other parties - are to be announced soon.Excitingly, the commission is already discussing with state officials certain water project proposals in line for funding from the Australian water fund. They are projects which conform to the National Water Initiative principles and they will lead to very significant environmental advantages, greater prosperity in regional areas and a stronger export performance - something that we in this country are all focused on at the moment.The $2 billion Australian water fund underpins infrastructure investments in water savings and efficiency projects - not only in regional areas, I want to stress, but in urban areas as well. This is an important point to make. I think it is true to say that the Australian people are seized with the importance of managing our water properly - as never before. They embrace the leadership that the Australian government has displayed in recent months. They want it to work. They expect us to get on with it.I trust that the remaining states and territories that are still considering their options will look at recent developments in a favourable light and get back on board as quickly as possible.</DOC>

 - Can I make a few points in response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, the scheme that is in place in Australia today is a scheme that was put in place by this government. For 13 long years, the Australian Labor Party did nothing about workers' entitlements in Australia. Secondly, this is a scheme which has paid out, to over 30,000 people, in the order of $280 million - $280 million provided by this government, in contrast to absolutely nothing provided by the Labor Party when it had the opportunity. The Labor Party talks about being a party of the workers. What a joke!So far as the community standard that the Leader of the Opposition asks about is concerned, the community standard was one which was established -  - essentially by the rulings of the Industrial Relations Commission. So far as the Walter workers are concerned, my department has written to the administrators, KordaMentha, asking them to set out an approach so that an early payment can be made to these workers. My department has received in the order of 200 claims from former employees of Walter. If the administrators actually provide the information which is required by the department -  - then we would be in a position -  - to actually move with the payments under the GEER Scheme. As for the interjections coming from the other side, I take it that that is an indication from the Australian Labor Party -  - that the Leader of the Opposition will write to the Premier of New South Wales and ask him to do what he has done in only one case before, and that is for the state to contribute as well. Of course, that will not happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and acknowledge the good work that he does representing the area of South Australia which includes Olympic Dam, which has the largest provable reserve of uranium in the world and which is owned by WMC Resources. Members would be aware that, in the last 24 hours, BHP Billiton has made an offer for WMC Resources at $7.85 a share, which has been recommended by the board of WMC Resources. BHP Billiton is the world's largest diversified resources company, created through a dual listing between BHP and Billiton.Members of the House would be aware that an offer was also made to WMC Resources by Xstrata, a foreign corporation, which required a consideration by me under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. On 11 February 2005, I announced a decision in relation to that which gave conditional approval. BHP Billiton is also a foreign corporation, so the application will also require approval under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act before it can proceed.The government has put in place a number of conditions in relation to BHP Billiton which were put in place at the time of the dual listing, conditions which related to the headquarters to be retained in Australia; the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to have their principal place of residence in Australia; a majority of board meetings to be held in Australia - and other conditions - to ensure the BHP company had a strong domestic residence. These conditions remain in place in relation to the dual listed company. The application that would be made in relation to WMC Resources would not change those conditions. They are conditions, in fact, of the dual listing.Members of the House - certainly on this side and I hope on both sides - would welcome the possibility that any new owner of WMC Resources would have the capacity to develop the wonderful Olympic Dam resource - Australia's largest uranium resource and, in fact, the largest proven uranium deposit in the world. Certainly, on this side of the House we would like to see new investment and a lift in the capacity of that mine, subject to all Australia's nuclear safeguards, to increase exports and to earn more income for Australia. If that were to occur through the outcome of either of these bids, once they have been passed, that would be a welcome thing for Australia and its export capacity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question because today I have seen some suggestions that there is little to show for the additional $4 billion that Australia has spent on national security since 11 September. Apparently, this is on the basis of only six terrorism arrests being made.If the member for Barton, who is normally known to not propagate nonsense of this sort, has any doubts about the effectiveness of our agencies, I would simply refer him to the available ASIO annual report and comments by the director-general of security. In the past three years, our agencies have been instrumental in the disruption in late 2001 of planning for an attack on Singapore, including against the Australian High Commission; the bringing to justice of those involved in the Bali bombing in October 2002; and the disruption in late 2003 of what we consider was planning for an attack here in Australia involving Willie Brigitte. ASIO has sought to identify Australians worldwide connected to terrorism. That work has taken our agencies from Indonesia to inside the Arctic Circle - to every continent except Antarctica.As the director-general has noted, the number of Australians confirmed or assessed to have undertaken terrorist training continues to grow. The ASIO annual report states that, since 11 September, 10 people have been refused entry to Australia because of their assessed involvement in terrorist activities. The same report says 20 Australian passports have been cancelled or denied by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs following adverse security assessments. Obviously, investigations are continuing. I would have to say that, if there is only one line of inquiry that leads to the disruption of a single terrorist activity here or abroad, then I am satisfied that every dollar spent on our agencies in Australia's interest has been money well spent.</DOC>

 - Yes, I was aware that the area consultative committee had raised some concerns about this project. But the area consultative committees have an advisory role. Yes, some weight is given to the comments they make. However, there is a very strong process of seeking consultation with the local community, and they strongly supported this project. I would also like to say this with regard to Kincumber Creek: if there is any community in this country that has a good project, put it up to the department and get it assessed. If you think your project is worth while, make a submission. A Kincumber Creek application was never put in. I am advised that to this date they have never submitted an application. If you think you have got a good case, put in an application - it is really as simple as that - and have it assessed through the process.My decision to fund this project was vindicated fully. Let me read out the vindication for that:The health of the local environment is critically important.As the local people put forward.People want to know that they can enjoy the area ... they also need to be reassured that the danger of flooding to homes at the mouth of the creek will be reduced.That sort of strong local support was one of the things that prompted me to realise this was a vital project to the community. Do you know who supported it? The Labor candidate. There was funding from Labor. That is who vindicated my decision. The Labor Party are attacking us for implementing their policy. It was your policy to fund Tumbi Creek. We are implementing it. It is a good project. The local people support it fully. It was the right decision and supported by the Labor candidate for that seat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his keen interest in ensuring that there are adequate apprentice positions, for young people in particular, in his electorate. The reality is that in recent years it has been almost impossible to employ school based apprentices at large commercial building sites. The reason for this is that if a contractor or a subcontractor employs an apprentice then they are required to pay the full union imposed rate of pay for ordinary workers over and above what the apprentice's productivity is actually worth. The consequence of this is that apprentices get priced out of jobs.School based apprenticeships were a recommendation of the Cole royal commission into the building industry, a recommendation which this government accepted. But, as we know, the ALP has rejected the recommendations of the Cole royal commission. So it was surprising that last week the Leader of the Opposition came out belatedly and said he supports school based apprenticeships. Last Monday he said in a doorstop:Back them up when they devise the schemes that they're ... putting in place to ensure that there's a stream in High School that give young people a start on apprenticeships.He also told the Derryn Hinch show that school based apprenticeships were 'a much more modern way of going into an apprenticeship now'.So we get this stream, this river of words flowing from the Leader of the Opposition, but has he bothered to tell the union movement? This issue was confronting the union movement last year. In August last year the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in the face of clear resistance from the CFMEU, the CEPU and the AMWU, decided to amend the building industry award to allow employers in the building and construction industry to take on school based apprentices. Up until then the award had not allowed them to do so. This was done by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the face of overt and hostile opposition from three major unions, which of course have contributed $13.4 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1996. The commission's decision stated that it was satisfied there was an overwhelming case to provide young people with as many pathways to sustainable employment as possible. It is all right for the Leader of the Opposition to tell people to back them up now, but where were the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? What were they saying to the unions? - What were they saying to the unions when they were standing in opposition? - Perhaps she was eating at Hungry Jacks, as the Prime Minister says. Once again, what we have here is the Leader of the Opposition reverting to type. We get this continual river of words from the Leader of the Opposition, but the test was there last year as to whether he was actually doing something about supporting a change. It is all right to come in now and carp on, as the Leader of the Opposition does, about what is wrong with the system. When he had a chance to do something and talk to his union mates, he did absolutely nothing.</DOC>

 - I did not ignore their advice. The ACC recommended this project for funding, but did not rate it a high priority. But the local community did, and so did the Labor Party. The Labor Party said:Labor's candidate for Dobell says Labor will fund the dredging of Tumbi Creek.So the decision was vindicated by the local community, the ACC and the Labor candidate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I understand that his confidence in the car industry in South Australia is so strong that he has just taken delivery of his second Mitsubishi. I share that confidence, particularly in that company. The Australian automotive sector is already racing away to another record year. New vehicle sales for the month of February hit a record of 81,009 vehicles - up almost seven per cent on the same month last year. Sales for the first two months of 2005 have reached more than 150,000, which is almost 10,000 more than by this time last year.The news gets even better for the local industry. Under the stability and the long-term program provided by the Howard government, exports of vehicles from Australia have almost doubled to the value of $4.7 billion. One-third of local production is now exported, including Toyota's Camry, which is not only a vehicle of high quality but the cheapest Camry made by Toyota in the world. The Australian built Camry is the most cost-effective vehicle built by that company anywhere in the world. As part of that ongoing confidence, Toyota announced on Monday a $47 million investment in an R&amp;D centre in Victoria.All this good news is a far cry from when Labor was last in power. It is worth reflecting on the last seven years under Labor when 20,000 jobs in the automotive manufacturing industry were lost, new vehicle sales grew by only one per cent per annum between 1990 and 1996 and only 10 per cent of local production was exported.Last night I had the pleasure to see two former industry ministers honoured for their contribution to the car industry. One of them, of course, was John Moore, the first industry minister under the current Howard government, who put in place the $3 billion plan which has led to these increases. -  - Mr Speaker, they might want to hear this bit. The other industry minister was, of course, John Button - the last Labor minister to have the courage of his convictions to do what had to be done for the car industry in terms of tariff reduction and in terms of industry competitiveness. While this Labor Party flip-flops on its policies on tariffs, the car industry in Australia is getting on with building better cars, providing better jobs and contributing to a better economy.</DOC>

 - I approved those projects that the letter relates to when I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Those applications were assessed by the department. I signed the approvals and I also signed the letters to those concerned with the projects, including local members. They were all handed, as they are, to the department. Plainly, in the interim period, the department had those letters. They would have had control of those letters. They went out sometime later - in fact, when I had been sworn in to another position. Quite plainly the department has the explanation for them - they certainly were not sent out; they were mislaid, as I said. -  - I hand them to the department. Let me go to the heart of this matter. What this is about is a good program that has hundreds and hundreds of excellent outcomes for rural and regional Australia. Programs like the one mentioned yesterday in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate in Bourke - a lonely little town where they tried to upskill the people at the child-care centre, something the Labor Party is continually going on about in this House. We were doing it first in Regional Partnerships with projects that upskill local communities. The Labor Party has nothing to stand on in this. They were good projects right across this nation to assist local communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know he is a strong advocate for aged care services in his electorate. I congratulate him on the 61 places his electorate was allocated in the recent aged care around. We have completed the 2004 aged care allocation round whereby 13,030 new aged care places were allocated across Australia. There were over 8,600 new residential care places and over 2,800 community places. That is a significant increase in the number of aged care places in this country. This government has now reached the benchmark of 100 operational aged care places per 1,000 of the population over the age of 70. This was a ratio introduced by Labor and not once did Labor meet its own benchmark. This government has met that benchmark and we have now increased the ratio to 108 aged care places per 1,000 of the population over the age of 70. This means that over the next three years 27,900 more aged care places will be allocated for older people in this country.New allocations mean more services for older people to receive at home and in the community. They mean more homes to people needing residential care. In the last two weeks alone since parliament sat I have had the opportunity to open new homes or extensions to homes in the electorates of the members for Macquarie, Mackellar, Macarthur, Boothby, Mayo, Ballarat, and Lyons and in my own electorate of Curtin. The other day the member for Cook and I launched the establishment of a 100-place village in Miranda and then last Friday we announced the establishment of a 100-place village in the electorate of the member for Fraser. The question has to be: what is Labor saying about aged care? Not a word. There has been a deafening silence from the Labor Party. During the last election, the Labor Party committed not one extra dollar to residential aged care places in Australia. This government is getting on with the job of delivering high-quality care places that are affordable and accessible for older Australians.</DOC>

He said:The grant application for 'Horse Australia' was one of those dealt with by me during this period.The Hon De-Anne Kelly MP as the relevant Parliamentary Secretary approved the application and signed the relevant papers for 'Horse Australia' and letters to stakeholders on 31 August 2004.It should be noted that after the election, while she was Parliamentary Secretary and before becoming Minister for Veterans' Affairs a further batch of applications were dealt with on 20 and 22 October 2004.During the period August to December there was an election, a new Ministry and a change in Parliamentary Secretary. During this period I had to make arrangements for the change-over of offices for the new Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon John Cobb MP.A number of approved applications with accompanying letters to stakeholders already been signed by the Hon De-Anne Kelly when she was Parliamentary Secretary had not yet been dispatched. I date stamped them on the day of mailing from the Hon John Cobb's office. Copies are on the file.</DOC>

 - The Australian government certainly provides a great deal of assistance to Australian farmers, with training activities. The honourable member for Hume would be well aware of the large number of activities under the FarmBis program conducted in his own electorate. In fact, around 150,000 farmers have participated in FarmBis activities since the program began in 1997. Over recent months, the Australian government has been negotiating with the states, who provide half of the funds for these projects, to agree to the new FarmBis 3 program, the third version of FarmBis. We have committed $66.7 million over four years to this program, and we have been able to reach agreement with South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia and even Queensland to continue FarmBis activities in those states for the next four years. Those negotiations will help to ensure that farmers are able to have continuity in training programs in those states.It is disappointing that New South Wales has not yet signed up to the FarmBis program. What is particularly extraordinary is that Minister Macdonald has been blaming the federal government for the fact that New South Wales has not signed up. We have signed with all the other states - all the other states are quite happy - but the New South Wales government declined the offer that was made to it for some interim funding while the new arrangements were being provided, as did Queensland. So for about 12 months now there have been no FarmBis activities to speak of in New South Wales. That is a pretty disgusting state of affairs. The reality is that the Commonwealth is ready to sign the agreement with New South Wales. I understand that there are no disagreements between the governments about the content, other than that New South Wales has not got around to yet committing the money that is necessary to ensure that this program can proceed.FarmBis has done a great deal to upgrade the skills of Australian farmers. All other states in Australia have signed up to the program. New South Wales remains absent without leave, and it is high time that Mr Macdonald got on with the job and signed the documents so that New South Wales farmers can continue to benefit from this program.</DOC>

I have to say at the outset that I have very great confidence in the personal integrity of both of the individuals involved - in the minister and, indeed, in the deputy secretary, whom I met in my very early days as a minister in this place. They are both people of impeccable personal standards of integrity. The point of this exercise rather eludes me. It seems to me to be quite evident that there is no serious conflict between the positions of the two at all. I will consult with both. If there is anything further to report to the House, I will do so, but I frankly think it very unlikely that there will be.</DOC>

And I am also aware that Leaders of the Opposition who run off newspaper headlines without doing any proper analysis normally do not succeed in going any further than being a Leader of the Opposition.

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. My attention has been drawn to a newspaper article in the Australian today which purports to show that tax take as a percentage of earnings increased between 1996 and 2004, according to an OECD report released overnight. In particular, it purports to show that there was a spike in the tax take in 2002. Members of this House will know that there were no tax increases in 2002, so they will be interested to know how this graph could possibly show a spike. Mr Speaker, let me say to you that that graph and the story that runs off it are dead wrong. Why? Because, as the report itself shows, for the year 2002 that graph included in the tax take on those people, for the first time ever, not an income tax and not an employee contribution tax but state payroll tax. State payroll tax was not, of course, introduced in 2002. The OECD decided to change its methodology and include state payroll tax in 2002 without redoing the historical tables back to 1996 to include it as well. So the comparison between 1996 and 2004 is a comparison between tax excluding state payroll tax and tax including state payroll tax.This point was made at page 30 of the report, which reads as follows:The increase in the wedge noted for Australia and Japan in 2002 are also the result of changes in reporting practices. In the case of Australia, state payroll taxes are included for the first time.What a surprise: the OECD put a state payroll tax in for the first time in 2002 and the graph showed that tax on income went up. That is not because tax went up but because the OECD put the payroll tax in for 2002 and forgot to adjust the tables for 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996. Which member of this House do you think was out early this morning trying to mislead people? There are people in public life in Australia today who have made a career out of denying that when you are paid $600 you get $600. That is completely misleading.I will present at the end of question time the OECD comparison of Australia's position in relation to the 30 countries of the OECD on tax to GDP ratios. Of the 30 countries in the OECD, Australia is the eighth lowest. There are 22 countries above us, including Canada, France, Germany, the UK and also, if I read this table correctly, New Zealand. The countries which are below us are some countries with which we do not normally compare ourselves, such as Mexico, Korea and Turkey. In addition to that, I present a press release from the Secretary to the Treasury nailing this dishonesty and indicating that this was referred to the OECD in 2004, as a result of which they changed their press releases and made the note inside the report. If the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer had any decency, they would get up and apologise for relying on these tables and misconstruing them and for all of the falsehoods that they have been spreading this morning.</DOC>

 - The honourable member could not have listened to the answer I have already given. - The payroll tax was excluded until 2002. I have just read this from the report itself:The increase in the wedge noted for Australia and Japan in 2002 - are you saying that the report is wrong? - are the result of changes in reporting practices. In the case of Australia ...I am reading from the report; you say there was no change in 2002. Let me read you the report:In the case of Australia, state payroll taxes are included for the first time.That is what it says - and again on page 31. This is the old trick - the old trick of the $600. Remember the $600 that did not exist? If he says it over and over and over enough, he can get a journalist to actually repeat it. Here is the report, page 30. There it is again on page 31. He is maintaining that the report is inaccurate because it says it was not included. - He is maintaining his position. He has got egg on his face and he is maintaining his position. That is what the report says. That is what the secretary to the Treasury says. If there is going to be a contest for credibility on economic policy and it is between Wayne Swan and Ken Henry, I do not know that it will be much of a contest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. Yes, my attention has been drawn to today's labour force statistics. These statistics are further evidence of the underlying strength and opportunities of the Australian economy. They are a reminder - particularly, in the fervid atmosphere of debate in this place, to the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him - that it is important that we keep a sense of perspective about reporting on the state of the Australian economy.These figures show that our unemployment rate remains at 5.1 per cent. That rate has not been lower since November 1976. In other words, you have to go back more than 28 years to find an unemployment figure that is lower than what has been recorded today. We have seen 20,000 new jobs created in the month of February; total job creations since March 1996 have now risen to more than 1.5 million. If we are talking about what is important to the men and women of Australia about the economy, it is important to remember that nothing exceeds in significance the capacity of that economy to generate jobs.Despite everything that has been said by the opposition - and notwithstanding the fact, as I acknowledged yesterday, that there were some figures last week which were seen, understandably, in a negative light - there is no point in pretending that you can preside over an economy for nine years or more and expect that every single statistic is going to be positive. It never can be and it never will be. In the months and years ahead, there will be other statistics that will be more negative than we would like. That is all the more reason -  - why we should keep a sense of perspective. The fundamentals of this economy are very strong. Unemployment is at a 28-year low. Interest rates remain at historically low levels. We have presided over significant reductions in the level of taxation. We preside over very high levels of business investment. And, in stark contrast to the performance of those who went before us, we have one of the strongest fiscal positions of any country in the world.I emphasise those things to make the point that I made to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. It is all right to get excited about one or two figures. It is all right to opportunistically run off some newspaper headlines - which the Leader of the Opposition has done this morning, to his very great embarrassment. The Leader of the Opposition gets up this morning, grabs hold of the Australian and thinks, without going into the detail of it, that he has another point of criticism. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that 1.5 million Australians have got work as a result of the policies of this government over the last nine years. We have delivered to the workers of Australia not only more employment but also higher wages, lower taxation and lower interest rates. That is a quadrella that they could never dream of enjoying under a Labor government.</DOC>

 - Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say alters the fundamental fact that he has got it wrong, the OECD has got it wrong, and the explanation that the Treasurer has made demonstrates that and demonstrates that very strongly. As I hope the Leader of the Opposition would know from his former experience, whenever you have benefits to wage and salary earners that are means tested - income tested - there is a point at which the withdrawal of that benefit will create what is variously described as an effective marginal tax rate. The Leader of the Opposition, if he had any semblance of honesty in this debate, would acknowledge that during the last budget we brought down a number of measures that resulted in a very significant relief being given to families of Australia in relation to the effective marginal tax rate.Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition again that the fundamental basis of the criticism that he and the shadow Treasurer have made based on the OECD report is totally flawed. As the Secretary of the Treasury points out in his press release, the OECD was told to correct the tables and the OECD failed to do that. Like those who jump in eagerly grabbing hold of any excitable headline, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley have not understood that if you introduce for the first time in 2002 the notion that state payroll tax is legitimately to be computed as part of income tax, and you do not make any adjustment for the previous years, of course you are going to end up with a higher figure in 2003 and 2004 than you have in 1996, because you are not, to use the colloquialism, comparing apples with apples.The reality is the OECD has got it wrong. That was pointed out by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley have got it wrong, just as they get so many other criticisms of the government wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question and acknowledge the work that he does in that capacity. I can inform the House that in the month of February there were 20,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy. What is more, there was a decline in part-time jobs so that the number of new full-time jobs created in the month of February was 37,900. That means that here in Australia in the last year, the number of new jobs created was around 325,000. For the 19th month in a row unemployment continues below six per cent and it continues at a record 30-year low of 5.1 per cent on a very high participation rate.There has been some commentary recently in the press about shortages of labour. There has been a lot of focus on skills shortages but, as I have pointed out on numbers of occasions, Australia also has unskilled shortages. Let me make the point: one of the reasons - perhaps the major reason - why we are now seeing labour shortages in the Australian economy is that unemployment is low. You never saw labour shortage problems in 1990, when unemployment was double the rate that it is now. As far as economic problems go, the problem of too many jobs chasing too few people is a good problem to have. It is certainly a much better problem to have than too many people chasing too few jobs. Nobody ever talked about skills shortages or unskilled shortages when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. I must congratulate him on that. The now Leader of the Opposition abolished labour shortages for a very long period of time. He abolished them by putting one million out of work. There were no shortages back then with unemployment at 10.9 per cent.Having said all of that, we should not be afraid of low unemployment in Australia. The object of economic policy is to get unemployment low - to give people the opportunity to find work. We can continue to run economic growth on low unemployment as long as we keep wages in line with productivity. The only way in which this could be disturbed by high employment and low unemployment is if people took the opportunity to try to base wage outcomes out of whack with productivity. If that were to happen then you would get inflationary pressures in the economy. But there is no reason for that. Real wages are growing in Australia. Unemployment is low. There are more people in work than ever before. The prospects for the Australian economy are for continuing jobs growth. Our goal ought to be this: a job opportunity for everyone who wants to work, with the opportunity of a decent wage in a growing economy. That is the object of economic policy.</DOC>

 - What this government is on about is higher wages and more jobs for Australians. The facts clearly speak for themselves. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pointed out in question time today, what we have had since 1996 is 1.5 million extra jobs in this country. In addition to that, we have had an increase in wages in real terms of over 12 per cent. - As I was saying to the House, since 1996 we have seen in Australia in real terms a 12-plus per cent increase in wages. That stands in stark contrast to the appalling record of the Australian Labor Party when it was in government, when we had an increase in real wages in this country of just over one per cent. That is the reality. Any future measures that this government takes will be in line with that desire of the Australian government not only to increase jobs for Australians but to continue to increase their real wages.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his interest. I know many veterans - and, indeed, the rest of the community - will be interested in this issue. There have been reports, which were referred to a couple of days ago, in the media about the Gallipoli peninsula, in particular Anzac Cove, and there being problems there. Let me just make a couple of things pretty clear in answer to the honourable member's question. I met with the Turkish ambassador just before question time today. We had a discussion about the proposal to improve the road system around Anzac Cove. The member for Hughes, in her capacity as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in August last year wrote to the Turkish authorities and explained that she thought there was a need for improvement in some of the road systems, for safety reasons. The Turkish authorities, quite rightly, are endeavouring to improve those roads. There has been significant erosion over the years, and the road above Anzac Cove, in particular, requires urgent reinforcing. The ambassador, yet again, has reassured me that the historical significance of Anzac Cove and other sites will be protected while these essential roadworks are undertaken. He has confirmed the advice that I provided to the House a couple of days ago that no remains have been uncovered during the roadworks and that soil which has been placed on Anzac Cove beach would be removed shortly. We are grateful for that.Can I also say that we appreciate very much the work that the Turkish authorities do to preserve the Gallipoli peninsula. We all know how much it means to us as Australians, and the Turkish government and the Turkish people are very sensitive to that. There is no suggestion that the Turkish government is going to somehow politicise the Gallipoli peninsula. There is no suggestion the Turkish government is going to turn it into some symbol of Turkish triumphalism, militarism and nationalism, as has been suggested in newspapers. I think it is very important that people be reassured that the Turkish government is working very closely with us to ensure that Anzac Cove and the Gallipoli peninsula are properly preserved and remain an enormously important commemorative memorial to our people as well as to the Turkish people, and that it will continue to look after the peninsula with appropriate dignity.</DOC>

 - I certainly do remember saying that. I remember making it very clear at the time that in order to follow through we would need the permission of the Turkish government. Discussions have taken place at a diplomatic level since then. In the cut and thrust of politics you can expect any question, but I think it is unfortunate that an attempt is being made by the member from Sydney to politicise this - I really do. But, anyway, I am very happy to acknowledge that it was on 18 December 2003. We can all work out how many months have gone by since then. I can point out that since then it has been the subject of representations, at a diplomatic level, to the Turkish government. I do not think it is unreasonable of the Turkish government thus far not to have responded fully. I echo what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, and that is that the Turkish government, in all of these matters, has exhibited a great willingness to cooperate with Australia. Any suggestion that there is any discord between the Australian government -  - The implication behind the question is either that the Australian government has not pursued the matter, which is wrong, or that the Turkish government has been dilatory in responding. Both of those allegations are wrong. They are not worthy allegations to be made on such a subject by any member of the opposition. I find it interesting that this question has been asked by the member for Grayndler and not by the Leader of the Opposition. But he has asked the question -  - I will simply say that we continue to be in discussion with the Turkish government. If, later next month, I see the Turkish Prime Minister in Istanbul, I will raise the matter with him. But I believe the matter is being appropriately pursued. I do not think the Australian government has lacked commitment and I do not for a moment think the Turkish government has been dilatory. I think it is regrettable that the question has been asked.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the member for Kingston, who comes from a state that will benefit massively from the Living Murray initiative, that his state will benefit massively from the initiative of the National Water Commission. I am pleased to inform the House that appointments to the National Water Commission have been approved by the Federal Executive Council and that the inaugural Chairman of the National Water Commission will be Mr Ken Matthews, who brings to the position relevant experience as a former secretary of the Commonwealth departments of Transport and Regional Services and Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He has been appointed also as chief executive officer of the commission. The three Commonwealth representative are Mr David Trebeck, a well-known agricultural economist; Mr Peter Corish from the National Farmers Federation; and Professor Peter Cullen, whose reputation in this area is renowned not only in Australia but around the world. The three commissioners nominated by the states and territories are Ms Chloe Munroe, Dr John Radcliffe and Dr Walter Cox.Each member of the commission has been selected for the expertise that he or she brings and the contribution they can make as individual members of the National Water Commission. There are very important, indeed historic, tasks ahead for this commission. Some $500 million will now be available for the Living Murray initiative, of which the Commonwealth has contributed $200 million. Projects from the various states that have been put forward will be considered according to the criteria of the commission. I am particularly pleased to inform the House that Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have now all reaffirmed their commitment to the National Water Initiative that they signed in June last year. I want to thank the premiers and chief ministers of those states and territories.This is an area where I believe the Commonwealth and the states can work together for the benefit of Australia. At the meeting that took place last year there was a spirit of cooperation. I welcome that and I welcome the reaffirmation of the states' commitment. I understand that discussions are progressing with Tasmania. I hope Tasmania signs the National Water Initiative. I invite Dr Gallop, re-elected as Premier of Western Australia, to reconsider his state's unwillingness so far to sign the National Water Initiative. The pastoralists of Western Australia will benefit enormously from that initiative. I hope that he and the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lennon, join with all the other states and, in response to the great conservation challenge of the age, we can have a truly cooperative response from the Commonwealth and all the state and territory governments of Australia. It is what the Australian people want, it is what the Australian people rightly expect and I hope it is what the Australian people will ultimately get.</DOC>

 - After being Treasurer since 1966! Why do I look so young? Somewhere there is an ageing photograph of me with wrinkles and lines, which is taking all of the punishment. Of course I have mentioned infrastructure in this parliament on a number of occasions. One of the obvious times that comes to mind was from last year's budget in relation to AusLink. AusLink would probably be the most major infrastructure that we have ever announced in relation to roads. I would be very surprised if I did not mention that. Australia's largest road project under consideration at the moment is a thing called the Scoresby Freeway. Memory would tell me that I have mentioned the Scoresby Freeway in this House on a number of occasions.Memory would also tell me that I have mentioned some of Australia's big mining projects and the investment that has been going on in mining. Let me make this point: infrastructure is not merely a matter for government; a lot of infrastructure in Australia is built by the private sector. Whether it be the alumina plant at Gladstone that I have spoken about on a number of occasions or whether it be other mining projects, that is real infrastructure. The other point that I have been making is that private investment, particularly in mining infrastructure, has been going up for a long time. We appreciate the question, but I will warrant you that, like many questions, it is based on a false premise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. I can inform the House that one way to address the doctor shortage is to make better use of the highly skilled and thoroughly dedicated nurses of Australia. That is precisely what the Howard government has been doing. In the 2001 budget the government provided some $26 million a year to subsidise the employment of practice nurses in country areas. I can tell the House that there are now more than 1,000 nurses employed in country general practice. In Strengthening Medicare these subsidies were extended to outer metropolitan areas. I can inform the House that there are now more than 550 medical practices in outer metropolitan areas that employ a practice nurse.In a historic initiative the government extended Medicare rebates for the first time to nurse consultations. I can inform the House that in the 12 months to February there were more than 20 million practice nurse consultations, and I am sure members opposite will be pleased to know that 94 per cent of those have been bulk-billed. The nurses of Australia belong in general practice just as much as they belong in hospitals. This is more good news from the Howard government and proof positive that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - In concluding an answer to the previous question, my colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing said that the Howard government was the best friend that Medicare has ever had. I can say this: the Latham opposition before the last election was certainly not the best friend that the mining industry of Australia has ever had. The recipe for the mining industry from Mark Latham and the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition was to take hundreds of millions of dollars away from the mining industry in order to fund university education. Let me come to the essence of the question. - Even the Leader of the Opposition may be interested in this. The essence of this - and it is all of a piece with the question that was asked by the member yesterday - is that in some way the money we make available for apprentices and for training is firstly inadequate and secondly skewed against those in the traditional trades. That is the charge that is being made by the Australian Labor Party. The member for Jagajaga, if she listens for a moment, might in fact understand how absolutely wrong that particular charge is.The government last year spent $510 million on providing incentives to employers with apprentices. In the 2001-02 financial year employers spent an estimated $3.6 billion in net direct expenditure on structured training. This represented an increase of 52 per cent since 1996. I take the opportunity - unlike the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who bags employers at every opportunity she gets - of thanking Australian employers for this commitment. Let me point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that employees in the traditional trades represent, presently, on my advice, 13 per cent of the Australian work force. Importantly, traditional trade apprenticeships currently represent 38 per cent of all new apprentices in training. In other words, you have a cohort in the work force which is 13 per cent, but the training additions to that cohort represent 38 per cent of all new apprentices. These are not rhetorical flights of fancy, grabbed from the air by somebody who has an ideological bias in this area, of which all of us are very well aware; these are fundamental facts about training in Australia.Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had a swipe at young Australians employed in the fast food industry. Apparently that is not a job that is worthy. She trotted out the member for Fowler on AM this morning to try and clean it all up, but nothing can alter the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is basically saying, 'Take the money out of Hungry Jacks and put it elsewhere.' That is basically what she is saying. Let me point out how wrong even that is.In relation to specific incentive payments, the typical incentive paid to Hungry Jacks for training a new apprentice is $1,375. The typical incentive paid to a building firm that employs a new apprentice as an apprentice carpenter in the metropolitan area is $4,400 - that is, $1,650 on commencement and $2,750 on completion. The total incentive is $5,500 for an apprentice carpenter in a regional area. In other words, the member for Jagajaga is wrong when she attacks apprentices in the fast food industry. She is wrong to suggest that we have a bias against the traditional trades. She is wrong not to understand that 38 per cent of all new apprentices are in the traditional trades, yet only 13 per cent of the entire work force is in that area. In other words, on a scale of 10, on this particular issue the member for Jagajaga scores a big fat zero.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I say to the people of Bass that they have chosen a very decent and a very outstanding new representative - and a very active one as well. He has been kind enough to invite me down there to visit the Australian Maritime College. - For history's sake we will visit the Albert Hall, and we will also have a look at Launceston Airport. As the member knows, we have been very active in the area of aviation security since September 11 2001. We have seen an investment of $162 million in security upgrades, including tighter screening of passengers' carry-on baggage, hardened cockpit doors, security officers on flights and so forth, but today the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 come into effect. They establish a comprehensive new security system for the whole of the aviation system. In something that I think is a testimony to the capacity of industry to work quickly and efficiently and well with government, I can report to the House that no fewer than 107 new prescribed aircraft operators and 144 new entrant airports enter the aviation security system for the first time today. That is 100 per cent of our airports and our airlines in this country. I thank them for their cooperation. I know it was not easy, but I think everyone knows that it is important.I invite members everywhere to visit those local airports, to talk to their owners - councils or whatever - about their new measures and any issues that they might want to raise. I can say, though, that the shadow minister for homeland security was absolutely wrong today when, extraordinarily, he was trying to say in this place that many of these airports and their owners had been left in the dark about the new regulations. One hundred per cent of them are now signed up to the new regulations. They have been passed. How can they be in the dark when they have been working with us for months to get the new arrangements in place?The key elements include a range of measures - control of access to security controlled airports; the issuing of aviation security identification cards, ASICs; control of weapons and prohibited items; provision of counter-terrorism first response; and severe and very real penalties for those who engage in what they might think of as practical jokes. Suggesting that there is a bomb in their friend's locker or in their friend's baggage - those sorts of things - will now leave people liable for very extensive fines. We do want people to desist from what they might think is amusing but which can cause major disruption and major dislocation for people. There are a number of other measures - hardened cockpit doors, a regime of checked baggage screening and so forth. I conclude by saying that the government takes the security of the travelling public very seriously indeed. I do want to again thank both airport owners and airline operators across the nation for their cooperation in ensuring that those who travel are as safe as possible and to say that we will continue to audit and monitor compliance very closely indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingsford Smith for the question. This is a very important issue. I think what that report shows is that there can be improvements - as there can always be in areas of training. I do not think there can be any doubt about that. But if we are to preserve - and may I say it again - a sense of perspective about this debate, we have to understand that you only have a shortage of skilled people when you have superior economic growth and superior economic performance. And that is the reason we have a problem. It is right to say that we have a shortage of skilled tradesmen in certain areas - that is the truth - and there are different ways that that can be dealt with. For example, we can deal with it by investing more, which last year the government committed itself to do. One of the major features of my campaign launch was a major new investment in skills development.We can also plug some of the gaps by changing the pattern of migration. One of the things that this government has proudly and consistently done since 1996 is to clean up the migration program. Something that would be one of the proud boasts of the current Attorney-General of the time when he was the minister for immigration was noted in the Australian newspaper yesterday. I was not terribly impressed with one part of the Australian newspaper this morning, but an article written yesterday by one of their economic correspondents, Alan Wood, is one I would commend to those who are interested in increases in skilled migration. Skilled migration is part of the answer; it is not a permanent answer.The permanent answer, of course, is to have effective training programs, and we are investing more. It will be very interesting to see what attitude the Deputy Leader of the Opposition takes to the establishment and funding of the 24 Commonwealth technical colleges. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been quite critical of that. We will be very interested to see how strong the support of the Labor Party is.In answer to the member for Kingsford Smith, the government are aware of training shortages. I do not pretend that the existing system is perfect, but it does not have the flaws that are alleged by your deputy leader. If we are to be objective and realistic, we have to understand that when we have very strong economic growth we inevitably will run into some skill shortages. I believe that they were anticipated by our government. That is why we pledged to put so much money into the area during the election campaign. We had a greater commitment in the last election campaign to training than did the Australian Labor Party. There was no issue in that campaign that we put greater priority on than the issue of training. After that, what the Labor Party offered was very paltry by comparison.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I recognise that, as the member responsible for Townsville, he has a very great interest in the role of Australian troops in Iraq and of course elsewhere. The focus of the Al Muthanna Task Group of 450 Australian troops will be to provide a secure environment to the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group's operations as they perform humanitarian, engineering and rebuilding tasks. It will also be to provide training to the Al Muthanna provincial Iraqi security force. This is yet another demonstration of this government's commitment to seeing Iraq become the successful democracy that we believe it can become.The honourable member asked if there are any alternative views. I am becoming something of an expert on Australian Labor Party policy on Iraq. According to my calculations, they have had 17 different positions on Iraq since 23 March last year, when the then Leader of the Opposition - remember Mark Latham? - said that the troops all had to come out by Christmas. The Leader of the Opposition, who professes to be a great expert on security policy - he is always telling us that - is sending a message to his backbench that he believes Australian troops should be out of Iraq. That is the message he is sending.But, the day before yesterday, the member for Griffith, who is the spokesman on foreign affairs for the opposition, demonstrated quite clearly how the Leader of the Opposition is in fact walking on both sides of the street on this issue. The member for Griffith said that Labor's policy was to assist the Iraqi people through enhancing border security. He said that there are terrorists coming through Iraq's highly porous borders - through Jordan, which has a 181-kilometre border with Iraq; Syria, which has a 605-kilometre border; and Saudi Arabia, which has an 814-kilometre border.I would like to know how Australia is supposed to be guarding these borders - a total of 3,650 kilometres of Iraqi border - and protecting the Iraqis from terrorists coming through those borders, but we should not have troops in Iraq. Presumably, the Leader of the Opposition believes we should send officers from the Australian Customs Service to set up customs posts - you know, in their neat uniforms, as you see them at Kingsford Smith airport, Melbourne Airport or wherever. Do they stand there and ask the terrorists to show their passports as they come into Iraq?Not only is the Labor Party's position on Iraq totally confused and intellectually incoherent, but the Leader of the Opposition on this question of Iraq says we should not have troops in Iraq but we should be guarding Iraq's borders. The Leader of the Opposition, yet again, is walking both sides of the street.</DOC>

 - The member for Braddon is showing a continuing commitment to the business of getting young people in north and north-western Tasmania into trades. Last week, along with the member for Bass, we hosted a forum. I was in the electorates of the member for Wannon and the member for Gippsland. I was in East Melbourne with many colleagues last week and I was very happy to talk with the local community. -  - Mr Speaker, there are plenty of parrots in the pet shop that want to buy into this argument but there are a few galahs at work as well. At the end of the day, what we found when talking to employers, to the community and to education and training providers was a real sense of purpose and partnership in the business of growing what has already been achieved over the past nine years. Earlier, the Prime Minister reported to the House that last year $510 million was provided by this government in incentives to help people take on apprentices. In the last reported financial year, there was an additional $3.6 billion in net direct expenditure on structured training, which is a 52 per cent increase compared to 1996. That sort of partnership is making an enormous difference, with some 70 per cent additional apprenticeship starts since 1996 to September 2004 in the traditional trades.The opposition have entered into this debate this week with so many flawed and uninformed arguments. Their analysis of employer incentives is flawed because it does not take into account that the overwhelming majority of employers of trade apprentices are small and medium sized businesses. The total for Hungry Jacks, McDonalds and so forth reflects the large number of people that they employ. The contribution of apprentices to employment growth is absolutely fundamental. People with trade skills cause six or seven untrained people to also get a job. The way this economy is going, all of those measures are showing why so many people are able to find work. It is now more a question of jobs trying to find people rather than people trying to find jobs.On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday this week, the opposition misrepresented the level of funding provided by the Australian government for vocational education and training. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued press statements which purported to show the level of funding provided by this government and the increases between 1997 and 2003. The opposition claimed that the funding provided for vocational education and training was inadequate. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition criticised the amount of funding provided by the government to certain employers in the form of incentives. This funding is paid for the training of new apprentices. It is vocational training and education funding.Interestingly, in the press releases and in the tables on funding levels that the opposition issued on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, neither the Leader nor the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made any reference whatsoever to the existence of training funding. I would invite members behind the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to understand this absolutely clearly: this is another example of an opposition walking both sides of the street. On the one hand they criticise the level of funding; and on the other they complain that too much funding is going to employers. At the end of the day, it shows that probably one of the greatest skills crises that exist in Australia today is right along the opposition front bench.</DOC>

 - I have said on a number of occasions that we would prefer Australia's current account to be lower. There are a number of factors that lead into an increased current account, a significant one of which being the exchange rate, which is at a very high level at the moment. Secondly, I have pointed to the fact that in relation to mineral exports in particular, where obviously we have capacity to increase volumes, we are now at some capacity constraints, particularly in relation to some ports. But the reason why I said that I expected that exports would increase over the next year or two is precisely that: the demand for Australia's mineral exports is probably higher than it has ever been. The price increases are now of quite a significant dimension, and it appears as if Australia has continuing capacity so long as it can overcome some of those supply bottlenecks. I also believe that in relation to rural Australia we are still suffering from less than adequate subsoil moisture, coming off the drought. I also believe that in the forthcoming year that will improve. Australia's prospects in relation to exports are indeed very strong, and what I said about them picking up over the years will undoubtedly occur. I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a great pleasure to be able to explain it to her.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I know that he is aware, and it gets raised in his electorate often, that superannuation is very important to his constituents, as is having the confidence that the money that people are putting away today will be there into the future. People have shown their confidence in the government's super co-contribution, with half a million low-paid Australians taking up that option of putting a dollar in for a dollar. Our regulatory and prudential arrangements have ensured that people can feel secure that under a coalition government their superannuation will be secured into the future.When we look at alternative policies and threats, we look directly to the Leader of the Opposition. Earlier this week in an interview with David Spears on Sky News, Mr Beazley had this to say about Australia's $650 billion of superannuation which is currently invested in our future:In the meantime what we are doing is looking at those huge resources available now through the Australian superannuation funds.Rather than letting it be there for what it was designed for - the retirement incomes of Australians - the opposition is looking at what Labor can do with the money. It is a bit like a great big dog in front of a butcher shop, looking in at the window and drooling away at all the meat in the window. He is looking at the assets and wondering what he is going to be able to do with them. The worst thing that could possibly happen to people's superannuation is to have running their superannuation fund someone of the ilk of a person that blew $10 billion. He could not tell when he had a deficit. He ran up the highest unemployment numbers this country has ever known and he oversaw the lowest number of apprentices. Having 'Beazley Incorporated Superannuation BS Funds' looking after Australia's superannuation might be the most dangerous thing that could happen to it.I will leave you with this concern. When Mr Beazley was asked on the Sky News program to comment on what he had in mind, he said, 'We are considering all sorts of things in relation to your super fund.' I remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is not his money; it is the Australian public's money. It is for their retirement.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Like me and all other members of the Liberal and National parties, the member for Wentworth believes in the cause of lower income tax - unlike the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has made a lot of contributions on taxation. But surely the most memorable - and it has been recalled by my colleague the member for Aston - was the remark made by the Leader of the Opposition on 12 July 2001, when he last led the Australian Labor Party. He was asked very directly by Neil Mitchell of 3AW:... are they paying too much income tax?BEAZLEY: No I don't believe so and I will say that with some vigour.Here is a man who, with his shadow Treasurer, has been running around the country saying, 'I am in favour of lower taxation.' The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition was in the vanguard of the high tax movement of Australia when he last led the Australian Labor Party, and nothing has changed.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Mackellar. The honourable member is a champion of democracy - there is no question about that. I notice the Labor Party is alive and well. I do not think there is any doubt that there is a complete sea change in the Middle East now in the approach of the region to democracy. On this side of the House, we are absolutely delighted to see the emergence of democracy in the Middle East. There is no doubt that the change in regime in Iraq - the overthrow of the barbarous tyranny of Saddam Hussein - has had a significant impact on the movement towards democracy in the Middle East: the Palestinian territories elections in January; the movement towards democratic liberalisation in Egypt and even in Saudi Arabia; and the people power emerging in Lebanon, sometimes called the 'Cedar Revolution,' which is leading to the Syrian forces being withdrawn from Lebanon, which we are delighted about. Let us not forget the elections that took place in Afghanistan on 9 October last year and the parliamentary elections that are to take place in the country later this year.There are some other views on this. There are, of course, the views of the Australian Labor Party, but there is also the view of the British Labor Party. I notice that British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, my counterpart, in a speech to the Fabian Society - an organisation much favoured by many on the other side of the House - when talking about the situation in the Middle East said there was 'something pretty remarkable going on'. He said it 'will be for historians to judge ... just how much the end of the Saddam regime in Iraq, and the free elections there in January, have contributed to what is now happening across the Middle East'. He went on to say:But I do not buy the claim that all this has nothing to do with Iraq, or America, or the west.Jack Straw went on to counsel his comrades on the left of politics, not just in the United Kingdom but around the world, so this is good counsel for the Australian Labor Party:Whatever the differences of opinion over Iraq, it would be highly dangerous for the Left to settle into a comfort zone as the opponent and critic of American power and American objectives in the world ... [The Left] should be seizing this opportunity, leading the drive to bring Europe and America together in support of democracy and freedom.They are fine words from the British Foreign Secretary. I only wish our own Labor Party would move out of the comfort zone of the left and join in this championing of democracy and freedom in the Middle East - you can do it if you try.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am asked whether I agree with the comments from the minister for health and Leader of the House. Of course I do. I get all of my best ideas from him. Bear in mind the way in which he advises us on all these matters, and that is how we get our best ideas. What we did in last year's budget was to sit down and implement very substantial changes. In last year's budget, I want to remind the House, not only did the government introduce tax cuts of over $14 billion across the forward estimates but our tax and family payments changes were worth $35 billion across the forward estimates. Included in that $35 billion was not only an increase in the family tax benefit part A but a change in the taper. There was also a change in the family tax benefit part B in relation to the income test. There was a disregard in relation to the family tax benefit part B for those mothers that were returning to work, to also ease the entitlements that they had. An accumulation of all of those things is that work incentives were heightened.The good thing about all of that is that it improved dramatically the situation for families, particularly families on middle incomes. Why do I make this point? I make it for this reason: the Labor Party has consistently opposed that $35 billion improvement under tax and family payments. - I will just remind the House of this: one of the favourite complaints of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley is: 'The government spent too much in last year's budget. What did it do? It cut tax and improved family payments.' After they complain that we spent too much, what do they prescribe? They are asked what they would prescribe and they say, 'We would prescribe more tax cuts and more family payments.' In other words, the very thing that they complain of they actually prescribe there should be more of. When you are walking on both sides of the street it is very uncomfortable. - Not only the Leader of the Opposition but the white bread politicians that stand behind him are being caught on this on a daily basis.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I would like to update the House on benefits flowing to Australian families from changes the government put in place in the last budget. Not only did the government put in place a tax cut of $14.7 billion over four years but in our extra assistance for families announced in the 2004 election there was an increase for child-care rebates of 30 per cent, for the first time the opportunity to claim back on your tax child-care expenses, a $300 increase to the maximum rate of FTB B and a one-off increase in family tax benefit assistance part A of $600 per annum. - I am coming to whether or not that was real. That is a big part of the discussion that is going on here. The government changed the taper rate on family tax benefit part A from 30c to 20c, it increased the income test threshold of family tax benefit B, it decreased the taper rate from 30c to 20c, it allowed a secondary earner to keep any FTB B received prior to re-entering the work force, it introduced a maternity payment of $3,000 and it changed tax free thresholds. As a consequence of that, somebody on the minimum wage, as a result of last year's budget, had an improvement in their financial position of about $23 a week.Would that have happened if the Australian Labor Party had been elected? Those of us who listen to the Australian Labor Party complain now about the situation for middle-income earners remember one thing: if Labor had been elected, family tax benefits would have been cut by $600 per child per annum. That was the Australian Labor Party's position. The member for Lilley, who was interjecting quite vociferously a moment ago, is now struck silent. It was his policy to cut family tax payments by $600 per child per annum. That was not just some accident; that was a deliberate policy. After the last election, the member for Lilley was asked this question: is it still your position that those $600, $1,200 and $1,800 cheques going to families are not real? Mr Swan replied, 'It is absolutely my position.'Fortunately it is not the member for Lilley who understands family policy. It was actually the shadow minister for health, Ms Gillard, who belled the cat on her colleague. She was asked on 1 November that same question: was the $600, the $1,200 and the $1,800 real? She said:I think we've got to be frank ... there were a lot of people who received $1200 or $1800 ... in a lump sum and ... were pretty keen to keep it, and ... identified needing to vote for the Howard Government as the way of keeping it.Throughout the whole campaign the member for Lilley, who would now profess his interest in families, ran through the whole of Australia with a policy to take $600 per child per annum off them. - The member for Ballarat says it's not true. I am sorry: it is in the published policies of the Australian Labor Party and, what is more, it was reaffirmed after the election. Let me read out what the member for Lilley said after the election. He was asked: is it your position that this money was not real? 'It is my absolute position,' he said. I am sorry: it was absolutely his position. That was the policy of the Australian Labor Party, and it took the shadow minister for health to take the opportunity to bell the cat and say: 'That was real. It was wrong. It was heartless.' For that reason the Australian Labor Party stands condemned for its newfound interest in Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for his question. On the first part of his question, he is wrong and the Prime Minister was correct in his answer of Thursday last week. In the first part of his answer he said no, market economy status has not been conceded. That is correct. The second part of his answer was yes, it was part of the negotiations. I was in Beijing negotiating as he spoke -  - I was in Beijing, negotiating on behalf of Australia, as the Prime Minister was answering the question in this place. - I am absolutely correct. Of course, after a range of consultations, I went to Beijing last week to negotiate some finer aspects of the feasibility study to set the ground rules for a negotiation, if the Australian government makes a decision to go ahead, on the basis of what had previously been agreed. The member for Hotham knows this has been previously agreed. I should hope he realises it has been previously agreed. - When we signed -  - When we signed the trade and economic framework in October 2003 there were a couple of important principles involved. This matter has been on the public record since October 2003. It has been on the DFAT web site ever since. I would presume that the shadow minister for trade would have read both before he went to China a couple of weeks ago to talk about this very issue with counterparts in China. I can read from what is in the trade and economic framework that was signed in October 2003. It says:Recognizing that Australia and China should negotiate on an equal basis, a joint decision by the two Parties to negotiate an FTA will take account of the results of the feasibility study and only follow Australia's formal recognition of China's full market economy status.That is from October 2003. It has been on the web site in the 'easy to read' version. It says that, under the TEF, Australia has agreed to undertake an FTA feasibility study with China and to recognise China as a market economy if a decision is taken to move to negotiate an FTA with formal negotiations. It has been well known. I table both those documents for the information of the opposition. It is a well-known fact that we have been moving forward on this basis.The member for Hotham then left the chamber. - To finish the point: since October 2003, the matter of the basis on which we would move ahead, if we decided to negotiate a free trade agreement with China, has been on the public record. From some of the public comments that have been made about this being a concession to China, we needed to obviously get something in return. We did that last week in my visit to Beijing, where we got the Chinese to agree to two very important principles. The first principle is that, if we begin these negotiations, we do so on the basis that everything is on the table - there are no prior exclusions and it is a comprehensive negotiation. The second important principle is that these negotiations be concluded as a single undertaking, where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Those are two very important principles that the Chinese have now agreed to. It is interesting to note that, in the years the Labor Party were in office, they were never able to achieve these sorts of negotiations with China or to structure this. These two principles are very important because they are not part of the agreement that China has made to go ahead with the ASEAN countries. They will be there if we go ahead with an agreement between Australia and China.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for the interest he has in this. Of course, there has been a lot of media reporting about the roadworks that are taking place on the Gallipoli Peninsula and around Anzac Cove. Let me make it clear to the House that about two million visitors a year go to the Gallipoli Peninsula, of whom 50,000 or so are Australians. So I think the House would understand that there is in particular an enormous amount of Turkish interest in the Gallipoli Peninsula. I asked our ambassador based in Ankara, Jean Dunn, to visit the Gallipoli Peninsula and Anzac Cove area over the weekend so she could inspect the roadworks herself. She has done so over two days. During those inspections she found no evidence of any human remains or bone fragments. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which operate in the Gallipoli area, advised her that they inspected the area thoroughly before and during the roadworks and found no evidence of remains. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission also advised that they thought it very unlikely that any human remains would be found, because they area was thoroughly searched for remains in the 1920s and any remains found then were interred in local cemeteries.A man called Bill Sellars, who is an Australian who lives in the area and has an intense interest in the preservation of Gallipoli, has told our ambassador that of two bone fragments that he had photographed one had disappeared and he could not relocate the other. The ambassador has asked him to advise us and of course the Commonwealth War Graves Commission if he does find any further remains, in particular so those remains can be treated respectfully and in the appropriate way. The ambassador did register yet again with the Turkish authorities our concern that, if remains were to be found, the roadworks should stop, and the Turkish authorities have agreed to do precisely that.Can I just conclude by saying again what I said last week. The roadworks are essential for safety reasons, given the enormous number of people who are going there. Erosion over the years has rendered the road above Anzac Cove dangerous and in need of urgent repair. Obviously, we would hope that those repairs would be done as sensitively as possible, and we are making that point to the Turks. Maybe some sort of rehabilitation work will have to be done in time if there is scarring as a result of the road. These issues all have to be worked through.It is very important that all of us register our gratefulness for the cooperation of the Turkish authorities in ensuring that the historic significance of the site is properly preserved. The Turks are very committed to that. The House should make no mistake: Gallipoli is enormously important to us, but remember that it is important to the Turks as well. It was an important event in the history of modern Turkey, not least with the coming forth of Kemal Ataturk, who was the leader of modern Turkey, as a very successful military leader. The government will continue to approach this issue responsibly, cautiously and with sensitivity - we understand only too well the sensitivities of the issue for all of us as Australians - to make sure that we transmit the right points to the Turkish government and not just make political points.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the Leader of the Opposition's question is no. As far as the rest of the question is concerned, article 24 of the GATT does indicate that all bilateral negotiations should be comprehensive. But the reality is that they are not. If you go and have a look at what has been structured in the negotiations between China and the ASEAN countries, you will see that it is not. So you give yourself the best chance of getting the best deal if at the start you have got everything on the table so you can start negotiating and you do not concede points just to get through the door.We took the decision when President Hu Jintao visited Australia in 2003 that we would sign the trade and economic framework because it was important to Australia to consolidate its position in that marketplace and to improve on it by going ahead and enhancing the relationship between Australia and China. That is certainly what we are doing. As the government of Australia, we took that decision, and we believe we are structuring this negotiation on our terms in the national interest of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The other side might jest, but the member for Kalgoorlie represents his electorate - which comprises the overwhelming majority of Western Australia - very well. It just so happens that the largest beneficiary of the resources boom that is focused on China at the moment is Western Australia and the seat of Kalgoorlie in particular due to the iron ore trade that is taking place out of Western Australia. At the beginning of next year, the LNG trade will begin out of the North West Shelf into Guangdong province in the south-east of China.The member for Kalgoorlie asked about progress on the pathway towards making a decision about an FTA with China. Following my trip to China and the meetings in Beijing last week, it seems now that the feasibility study on this process leading to a decision about going ahead with a free trade agreement negotiation should be complete by the end of this month. We have argued strongly, as I have indicated in the last couple of answers to questions from the opposition, that there are some very important and fundamental principles that must be agreed to at this stage. They have been agreed to, and that puts us in a position of negotiating on our terms.It goes without saying that a free trade agreement with China would link us more strongly than we already are with our second-largest merchandise export market - a market which has quadrupled over the last decade and whose GDP is forecast to grow by over eight per cent per annum for the next 10 to 15 years. I can assure the House that the decision on whether we proceed with an FTA with China will be based, firstly, on the feasibility study - on an economic analysis that is being undertaken - and, most importantly, on an overall assessment of the national interest.It is unfortunate that the member for Hotham is not in the House. The member for Hotham, I was pleased to read, is on the record as saying that he supports the government's decision to grant market economy status if we proceed with formal negotiations - that is the point at which we will agree to market economy status for China. He has agreed with the government on that. In a speech that he gave in China last month, he said:The Australian government's agreement to China's demand that FTA negotiations can only occur if Australia recognises China as a market economy was a significant concession before FTA negotiations began.Then he went on to say:I have therefore consulted extensively on this issue with business, trade policy experts, industry groups and unions.On the basis of my discussions so far ... I am not convinced by the argument that granting China market economy status will undermine our anti-dumping regime.I agree with the member for Hotham. It is not every day that the government gets to acknowledge a contribution like that, but he made a very good point - that is, that granting China market economy status will not undermine our antidumping regime in Australia, which is the nub of this whole argument.</DOC>

 - The last thing I would want to do is to pretend that everything is absolutely hunky-dory and that those people are not disappointed by premium increases. All of us are disappointed by premium increases. The point I would make is that premiums are 30 per cent lower than they would otherwise be, thanks to the policies of this government. What I hope the new member for Parramatta has had the decency and the good faith to point out to her constituents is that the ALP has never supported the private health insurance rebate. We had the former Leader of the Opposition calling the private health insurance rebate the 'maddest piece of public policy' ever to come out of this parliament, and we had the current Leader of the Opposition calling it a 'piece of very bad policy', a 'piece of policy chicanery', 'exceptionally bad public policy', an 'extraordinarily bad piece of public policy', a policy to 'reinforce failure', and at one stage he even called it a 'boondoggle'. I think what the member for Parramatta needs to explain to the couple in her constituency is that the situation would be much worse if the ALP ever became the government of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can reassure him and the House that this government is committed to a more flexible workplace relations system, because it is through that flexibility that we have been able to create 1.5 million extra jobs in Australia over the last nine years and to see real wages for ordinary Australians increase by more than 12 per cent. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition again displayed the ALP's antagonism towards casual employment and the flexibility that that involved. He said:... what their parents want for their young folk is an opportunity to be able to build a life. To be able to have a family, create for that family opportunities, to be able to pay a mortgage, pay private health insurance. You can never do that with a casual, low paid job. You can only do that if you've got a career.The Leader of the Opposition misses the point. He is saying that you cannot have a career if you have or start with a casual job, or he is saying that a casual job is not a starting point for a career. The reality is that there are many members in this place who started their careers with a casual job. That is the reality - I did and many other people in this place started their careers with a casual job.Let us look at the reality of casual employment. The reality is that a casual job is often the first stepping stone into employment for many young people in this country. The reality is that, for students who want to be able to balance their work and study and have extra income, a casual job is a reality which they very much want. A casual job offers many parents, particularly women who are returning to the work force after having a child or children, the opportunity to be able to balance their family responsibilities with their working life. The reality is that some 40 per cent of people who have casual employment in Australia are either students like those who work in Hungry Jacks, McDonald's or Coles supermarkets, something which the job snobs over here want to deny, or parents who are returning to the work force. If we look to the future and the demographic changes which are occurring in this country, we see that many mature age workers in this country will wish to phase their retirement and also engage in casual employment. Last week, or just recently, the Leader of the Opposition told the Business Council of Australia that the ALP had embraced a flexible, productivity based workplace relations system. We are waiting to see them practise it and put it in their platform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I can inform the House that, while Australia has the world's best record for successful organ transplantations, until recently we had the world's worst record for organ donations. It has improved a little over the last 12 months: there has been a 20 per cent increase in organ donations and there are an extra half a million people on the Organ Donor Register, taking it up to just over five million. But there are still some 2,000 people on organ donor waiting lists at any one time and in any one year. Tragically, some 100 people will die while waiting for an organ transplant.State and federal governments are working together to make a difference. From 1 July, the Organ Donor Register will change from a register of intention to a register of consent. That should relieve grieving families from the burden of very difficult decision making at a very difficult time. Also, in April, the federal government will spend $6 million asking all Australians to consider joining the Organ Donor Register. I hope that, when those letters arrive, people do not treat them as just another piece of bumf mail. It will not be just a letter from the government; it will be a letter from the Pharmacy Guild and the Australian Divisions of General Practice, urging people to consider their potential to save a life by joining the Organ Donor Register. Five million people on the register sounds like a lot, but we can do a lot better than that. Let us get it much better after April.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know he is getting on with the job in his part of northern Adelaide, and I appreciate the work he does so well. Members of the House would be wise to read the excellent article penned by the Treasurer in today's Australian, which outlines very clearly how Australia's growing economy and our ageing population have of course led to the enormous increase in demand for skilled workers. It is now a case of jobs looking for people, not people looking for jobs, the way it was under the previous government.The good news is that more than 90 per cent of those people who complete an apprenticeship have ongoing employment within three months of that completion. There is strong growth in commencements in the 12 months to September 2004. The number of people actually commencing trades and trades related apprenticeships increased by 19 per cent, which is good news. Overall Commonwealth funding to the vocational education and training sector has increased to its current level of $2.1 billion a year. That is a real increase of 57½ per cent since 1996. Election commitments that will be delivered on time, in full, in the budget - I do not suppose the Treasurer will mind me mentioning that; I will not go too far - are worth an additional $1.06 billion over the next three years.We are addressing the skills needs in trades such as the automotive mechanical trade, building and construction, plumbing, electrical trades and commercial cookery. The initiatives include the establishment of 24 Australian technical colleges, the establishment of the Australian Institute for Trade Skill Excellence, the $800 tool kit for new apprentices in skills shortage occupations and the Commonwealth trade learning scholarships upon successfully completing the first and second years of an apprenticeship - that is $500 per year over those two years. There is funding of 5,000 additional places over three years in the New Apprenticeships Access Program, which means we will see 10,000 of those disadvantaged people in our community gaining access to apprenticeships, and over $100 million to establish an Australian network of industry careers advisers. These commitments complement the work that this government has done progressively and aggressively over the past nine years. This has already led to a significant increase in the numbers of those in the trades, but we will keep working hard to keep making that happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her interest in superannuation. I released the regulations today for the implementation of choice from 1 July this year. The regulations will empower Australians to have control of their own superannuation funds and will give certainty to the industry to enable it to work with Australians to build on their retirement income. At the same time, I released the two-page super choice form, which will be made available to employees around the country so that they can make a choice about the second largest financial decision they will make in their lives, after the purchase of their own home: where they will put their superannuation. We also informed the public today that the education program of $19.7 million will roll out, as of next month, both to employers and employees to ensure the smooth implementation of the program.I inform the House that we will legislate for states to be brought into this jurisdiction. Having written to the states on two separate occasions and not having received an adequate response from the premiers, we will move to legislate so that state awards will in fact be able to come into this choice regime.The Leader of the Opposition sits in the chamber making noises. I would ask him to confirm whether or not he agrees with Senator Sherry's comment to the ISFA conference on 2 August that a Labor government would require the states to legislate for choice. I would ask whether this is still Labor policy or whether you are walking both sides of the street yet again.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that my office and the office of the Deputy Prime Minister meet regularly. I can also confirm that I am delighted that they do. I would have thought communication between the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister was very important. I can also confirm that a decision was made, as I have previously indicated, to go from a loan to a grant for the reasons that I have outlined. I can also confirm that, as to the rest and residue of the member's question, if there is anything further I should properly add, I will treat it with the same respect as I do the questions of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wills.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question and acknowledge his deep interest in the issue of aged care in his electorate. Dementia in all its forms is a degenerative condition that affects memory and personality. It can result in not only mental decline but also behavioural decline. It is a very emotional issue for those living with the condition and for their families and their carers.The risk of dementia increases with age, so, with an ageing population, the prevalence of dementia in our community will increase. That is why the Australian government announced last year that dementia would be an Australian government national health priority. That is why we announced funding of a further $200 million for dementia care and research, in addition to the $2.7 billion that is already invested in support for people with dementia and their families. This $200 million comprises funding for dementia-specific care packages, as well as for further research and awareness through education and training opportunities for police, ambulance workers and other community workers.This week is Brain Awareness Week. Today I announced a further $750,000 in funding for the Living with Memory Loss program, which already receives $1.5 million. It has already proven to be very successful in giving practical advice and assistance to people living with dementia. Australian researchers have been funded to carry out research, in collaboration with the international research effort, to find a cause and a cure for dementia, but in the meantime the Australian government will continue to provide support and funding for practical outcomes for people with dementia, their carers, their families, service providers and organisations such as Alzheimers Australia, which received $5 million in funding from the Australian government last year to continue their work for people with dementia and their carers.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that an amount in the order of that mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition has been expended. The Leader of the Opposition will know that the great bulk of that comprised the original federation grant of $5 million, which had the support of a lot of people, including, I think, successive Queensland governments of both political stripes. I have already explained to the House the basis of the moneys that were made available - along with new moneys made available by the Queensland government after the organisation was clearly in financial difficulty. For the reasons I have explained, an on-balance judgment was made to support it. I am aware of the financial difficulties that continue. I am not aware of the precise details of the orders of the Queensland Supreme Court. I repeat: if there is anything further that I need to provide to the Leader of the Opposition, I will be very happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question and for his interest in this very important area. Since coming to this portfolio, many things have become apparent about those people who are on the disability support pension. Probably the most relevant to the discussion today is that the Labor Party has given up on people on the disability support pension, and that is a national disgrace. The second thing I would say is that this government is the best friend that people with a work force capacity have ever had. That is why we are determined as a government not to give up on those people who are on the disability support pension.I reported to the House earlier this year that, in a disability support pilot that we ran, about one in three participants were able to find an outcome. They were able to go into employment, education or training. We never gave up on those people. I am pleased to report to the House today that that figure has increased to about one in two. We are very proud of the fact that this government is determined to help back into work those people who are on the disability support pension and have a capacity to work. We will never give up on those people who do not have a capacity to work and we will always protect the rights of those people. But this government recognises that there are now about 705,000 people in this country who are on the disability support pension. Since 1981 that figure has increased by about 300 per cent. At the same time, the population has gone up by only about 35 per cent. So the fact is that the system has been compromised. This government remains committed to restoring integrity to the system so that we can continue to support those people who do not have a capacity to work and, at the same time, wash aside the Labor Party's response of giving up on those people and help into work those people on the disability support pension who have the capacity to work.</DOC>

 - I have numerous discussions with the member for Wentworth. As it happens, we had a discussion not seven minutes ago about taxation. He was showing me a letter he was writing to the Sydney Morning Herald to correct a misreporting of his views. I will let the Leader of the Opposition in on another secret: I had dinner last night with the member for Wentworth. I hasten to assure you that the member for Indi was present as well. But do not worry - it was a very kosher gathering because the member for Corangamite was there to keep us in order and there were sundry other colleagues there. The member for Kingston was there too, doing that sound South Australian commentary, and there were numbers of others of my colleagues.Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that all of us on this side of the House are very proud of the way in which taxation has been reduced under this government. We are very proud of the fact that further taxation cuts will come into operation, as legislated following last year's budget, on 1 July this year. I am very proud of the fact that, as a result of the tax and other reforms that this government has undertaken, the disposable income of an average production worker in Australia is the second lowest in the OECD area. -  - I am sorry, Mr Speaker  - the second highest in the OECD area. I am proud of the fact that the taxation levels in this country are the eighth lowest in the OECD area. I am also proud of the fact that this government in the last budget introduced changes to our welfare and taxation systems that have greatly enhanced the position of Australian families, not least those on low and middle incomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her interest in this issue. Yesterday was the one-month anniversary of Rafik Hariri's assassination. There was another very powerful demonstration of people power with a simply massive turnout at a peaceful demonstration in Beirut. Lebanese, British and French media reports estimate that the turnout was around one million people. The demands of the people in the street were the same as I articulated a month ago: the perpetrators of this vile act of terrorism must be brought to justice. Also, there is no doubt that Syria must implement Security Council resolution 1559 and fully withdraw from Lebanon, and we are pleased to see that beginning to happen.What is happening in Lebanon is part of a broader trend in the Middle East. People of the Middle East are standing up to terrorism, violence, intimidation and tyranny. People of the Middle East are increasingly turning to freedom and democracy. We should be ensuring that everybody in this parliament - not just the government but the whole parliament - supports this campaign as best we can. I mentioned yesterday the speech of the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, to the Fabian Society, applauding the movements towards freedom and democracy in the Middle East and making the point that you could not divorce that from what has happened in Iraq.Even the US Democrat senator Ted Kennedy says that what has taken place in the Middle East is 'enormously constructive' and 'a reflection the President has been involved'. That is an extraordinary concession coming from somebody like Senator Kennedy, who is an eternal critic of the Republican Party and has been a strong critic of President Bush.In conclusion, let me remind the House again about the British MP, the left-wing member for North East Derbyshire, the redoubtable Harry Barnes. I am trying to check this, but I think my parents-in-law may actually live in his electorate, although they would not vote for him of course. They would certainly never vote Labour, but maybe they could be persuaded to next time because Harry Barnes is somebody with a bit of courage. He is somebody who has adopted the strong position of helping to set up the Labour Friends of Iraq. Let us remind ourselves of what he said:_ we must face the facts if we are to provide solidarity to Iraqi democrats in their hour of utmost need. My plain message to those on the left who ... rubbish Iraqi democracy because they cannot stand the idea that ... Blair or ... Bush get some sort of credibility from them is to get real and do so quickly.In Britain, Labour Friends of Iraq, which costs £30 to join, are supporting the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions. They are supporting the Iraqi labour movement, and that is what the Labor Party in Australia should do.</DOC>

 - The answer to the second question is no. As to my call to have a sense of proportion, I stand by that. I simply make the point that if the Leader of the Opposition wants an intelligent, engaged debate on this issue, he would recognise that, if you go back over the last 20 years, interest rates in this country at the present time, notwithstanding the recent increase, are at very low levels. - I know that the Leader of the Opposition finds this painful, and the member for Lilley interjects about campaigns. Yes, I did campaign very strongly on interest rates. I do not regret anything I said to the Australian people because everything I said about interest rates was true. I reminded the Australian people that when Labor was last in office, housing interest rates went to 17 per cent, small business rates to 20 per cent and bill rates for farmers went to 21 per cent. -  - Since we have been in government, interest rates have moved between six and eight per cent compared with 10 and 17 per cent for Labor. There is nothing falsified about that; there is nothing exaggerated about it. I stand by the statement I made to the Australian people that interest rates under the coalition will always be lower than interest rates under Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. As he would remember, and as members of this House would remember, when the government went to the Australian public to introduce a goods and services tax, it made it entirely clear that this was a replacement tax for other indirect taxes; that the Commonwealth would abolish the wholesale sales tax, which it did; and that the Commonwealth would expect the states to abolish their indirect taxes. This would start with bed taxes, financial institutions duty, reducing their gambling taxes and abolishing their bank account debits taxes.When the GST legislation was finally negotiated through the Senate, the base was not as broad as the government had proposed and there was some doubt as to whether the revenue would be great enough for the states to abolish those taxes. It was agreed that we would wait until 2005 and review the issue. I can report to the House that the actual receipts of GST are greater than we expected when we came to that agreement in 1999. Of the $35 billion in revenue going to the states this year, they will be getting a windfall of $1.9 billion over the guaranteed amount. That means there is now no excuse not to abolish those indirect state taxes which are to be replaced by the GST.There will be a meeting of state treasurers with the Commonwealth on 23 March where this matter will be decided. I want to say to the House that there have been some welcome developments overnight. In particular, there have been welcome developments from the Queensland government. The Queensland Treasurer, Mr Mackenroth, is quoted in today's Courier Mail as saying that he will be coming to the meeting on 23 March with an open mind. He said:We will go into the meeting _ with an open mind _ we have to have enough money to deliver services.But he accepts that the windfall will be available for the abolition of some of those state taxes. He said:We will see what we can deliver, but we won't be bludgeoned by Canberra over it _There is no intention whatsoever to bludgeon states; there is an intention to keep to the agreement of 1999. Nothing could be more simple.Let me make two points. The first point is that those states which abolish their inefficient indirect taxes and which now have the capacity to do something will be doing something for their own consumers and businesses. The second point is that, if states like Queensland are prepared to lead the way, it will be the state of Queensland that will steal the economic advantage from other states that follow. I would say to the states as they come to that meeting on 23 March that those states that lead the way and abolish their tax bases will be the states that will attract investment and whose people will have improved standards of living.The government welcomes the statement that has been made by Mr Mackenroth overnight. I would have hoped that both sides of this House would have joined together in maintaining the Commonwealth's position on the abolition of state indirect taxes and the ending of double taxation as a consequence. There has been an eerie silence from federal Labor. Why? Because the Leader of the Opposition is a patsy for the state premiers and he cannot stand up to them. That is the truth of the matter. He has been shown up by Terry Mackenroth, whose stand on this we welcome. We urge the other state treasurers and premiers to follow the lead that is coming out of Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise that he chairs the Australia-UAE Parliamentary Friendship Group. This morning in the building I co-chaired the fourth Australia-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission with Minister Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi and her colleagues from the UAE government, who are visiting Australia with a rather large business delegation at this time. This is the fourth joint ministerial commission that has been held. It is a very important mechanism for strengthening and enhancing an already significant economic relationship between Australia and the Emirates. The UAE is Australia's second-largest export market in the Middle East. Two-way merchandise trade stood at about $2.2 billion in 2004. Importantly, two-way trade in services stands at $1.5 billion between Australia and the Emirates.As a result of the discussions that took place in the JMC this morning, this relationship is set to grow and expand even further, following agreement reached between my UAE ministerial colleagues and me to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement between Australia and the United Arab Emirates. It is a very important market in the Middle East, as I indicated. This will be Australia's first free trade agreement negotiation with a country from the Middle East region - a significant step forward. Australian exporters can expect big gains and opportunities from a prospective free trade agreement with the Emirates.The Emirates is a regional financial and transportation hub - the Singapore of the Middle East, if you like. It is a launch pad into the Gulf and Middle East markets and a very important trading partner of Australia's, as I indicated. Currently, over 100 Australian companies have their regional headquarters in Dubai and over 6,000 Australians reside in the UAE. The Emirates has enormous oil and capital reserves and it is looking to diversify its investment portfolio as its economy is forecast to continue to grow at current rates. A free trade agreement with the Emirates was a key element of the government's trade policy commitments at the last election. This demonstrates not only our government's dedication to implementing our election commitments but also our dedication and approach to delivering ongoing market access improvements around the world for Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - I would like to refer to the case that has been raised by the Melbourne Institute, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Lilley. The case is a single earner on a minimum wage with one child under five. On a weekly income of $467.30 such a person would pay $66.57 in tax. They would receive $58.59 in parenting payment, $78.76 in FTBA and $57.49 in FTBB for a total of $194.83. They would receive a low-income rebate of $2.43.They have a private income of $467.30, parenting payments and FTB of $194.83 and in taxation a net figure of $64.13. Out of the weekly wage of $467.30 they have a disposable income of $598.10 - that is, in net terms not only do they not pay tax but they receive more in tax benefits than they actually pay in tax. Let me turn it around another way. After their tax benefits are taken into account, on an annual basis their income jumps from $24,299 to $31,096 - that is, instead of paying tax, that family actually receives in tax benefits in net terms $6,796. The person on the minimum wage pays no tax and, after they receive their tax benefits, receives in net terms an additional $6,796. They receive $6,796.What did the budget this year do for that family? Let me tell you. The budget this year made that family $23 a week better off. How did the budget make that family $23 a week better off? It made it $23 a week better off because it increased family tax benefit A by $600 per annum, it increased the free area for the family tax benefit by $420 and it increased the amount for the family tax benefit by $150 from 1 January, but that will be $300 in a full year. With the changes to the tapers, the free areas and the amounts, that family through this year's budget was made $23 a week better off. It was already in a net refund position and it was made $23 a week better off.If the member for Lilley were really worried about this family, Mr Speaker, you would think that his policy at the last election would have made that family better off, wouldn't you? Because otherwise it would just be hot air. I do not think he would be running around mouthing concern for this family if his actual policy did not make them better off. But I have to let the House into a secret - he had a policy for this family at the last election. Do you know what it was? It was to strip them of $600 of family tax benefit part A. Is that right? It would not be the case, would it, that the member for Lilley would run around professing concern for a family who he wanted to actually strip of benefits? That would not be the case! A white-bread politician would not be that cynical - oh, no!In the last budget we increased by $600 family tax benefit A, we increased the free area for family tax benefit B, we reduced the taper for family tax benefit B and we increased the amount. That family was made $23 a week better off and is in a net refund position - a position that the member for Lilley wanted to oppose.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the considerable expertise that he brings to health issues in this House. Today I am announcing a Productivity Commission report to study the long-term education and supply of health professionals in Australia with a view to taking away any regulatory or competitive blocks preventing the training of sufficient doctors, nurses and specialists to meet Australia's needs in the future.In its landmark report released back in 2002, the Intergenerational report, the Commonwealth showed that no area of expenditure will increase faster over the next 40 years than health. Health is expected to grow from 4.7 per cent of GDP today to 9.9 per cent of GDP in 2040. The consequences of that are that, if we are to maintain the standards that we have today, if we are to respond to technological developments and if we are to cope with the ageing of the population, expenditures will double in proportion to GDP - meaning that, if you want to keep Australia on the same tax base, other areas of expenditure commensurately will have to recede. That is the implication of the ageing of the population.This government has already put in place measures to boost the supply of doctors and nurses. But in response to a COAG request and state government requests the government will commission the Productivity Commission to look at those restrictions on supply, including restrictions on the supply of specialists. There is a concern that in relation to specialist training not as many specialists are being trained. In order to meet that looming demographic change and technological change, we will have to boost the supply of health services. The Productivity Commission report which I am announcing today will go a long way down that track.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no. I do not believe it is a justified construction of the remarks made by General Cosgrove to reach the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition did in the concluding part of his question. It is true, as the government clearly laid out in the election campaign, that this country is suffering a skills shortage. It is largely a result of our economy having performed so strongly. That is the reason. There is no secret.What the Leader of the Opposition should be reminded of is that every time he complains about this expenditure of $66 billion he is complaining about the more than $1 billion that the government invested in skills upgrading. He is complaining about the $14 billion of tax cuts. He is complaining about the $23 billion of family tax benefits. He is complaining about the additional expenditure on roads infrastructure. The Leader of the Opposition has a problem: he excitedly runs after the latest headline in a newspaper without understanding that, unless you have a consistency of policy, unless you recall your previous stances, you can get yourself into a great deal of difficulty.This country does have a skills shortage and this government has never sought to deny that. It is a function of a very strongly performing economy, and this government is putting in place a large number of measures to address the skills shortage. -  - I hear calls from the opposition about 'nine years'. Let me go back nine years; let me go back a bit further than nine years. Do you know how many apprentices there were in December 1995? Were there 200,000? No, there were 143,700. How many were there in September 2004? There were 393,800. In other words, we are very proud of the commitment that we have made to apprentices throughout the nine years that this government has been in office. We are very proud of the commitment we have had to training. But does more remain to be done? Yes. That is why, in the fullness of time, the commitments we made in the last election campaign will come into effect.There has been enormous interest expressed in the construction and development of the 24 Australian technical colleges around Australia. I notice that, in the last election campaign, the former Leader of the Opposition opposed the Australian technical colleges. I am pleased to note that I think the current Leader of the Opposition has reversed that policy. I am not absolutely certain - maybe he could clarify that, maybe he could make it clear that he is definitely going to support it. There is no doubt that this country does need to adopt new measures to address the skills shortage, and that is exactly what the government is doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He and so many people on this side of the House are very enthusiastic about giving support to the various choices young people seek. In fact, we saw a 52 per cent increase in the number of school based new apprenticeships in the 12 months to September last year. In fact, there are now over 12½ thousand school based new apprentices. But, sadly, over half of those are in one state alone. It is sad, because a school based new apprentice is somebody more likely to actually complete their training, because of the environment they start that training in. These apprenticeships include the hospitality, retail, agriculture, forestry, property, building services, building and construction and manufacturing sectors. Since 2000 the numbers have surged from just 2,370 a year to this magnificent figure of 12½ thousand plus. This gives young people the opportunity to gain nationally recognised trade qualifications and work experience while they are still at school.The Australian government are committed to this process. Over the next three years, out of that $66 billion the Labor Party does not like us spending, we are providing an extra $17.9 million, which will create an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeship places through group training organisations. This will of course address so many of the skills demands in industries. It will increase career and training pathways available to school students.The concern that we have on this side can actually be addressed by those on the other side: their political masters - the union movement and, indeed, the state governments, whom the Leader of the Opposition owes his career to - can in fact make a difference tomorrow. In the state of New South Wales there are no school based - that is, part-time - new apprentices in the trades with skill shortages. None, zero. In the biggest state of Australia, the answer is zero. We need to see a change in that. In Western Australia, in the building and construction trades, I am advised there are virtually no school based new apprentices. It is because of state based industrial awards that these starts are being prevented for young people.The Australian technical college initiative - $289 million over the next three years - will provide more opportunities for school based new apprentices in years 11 and 12. We have made progress as a government, and we are determined to keep that progress coming.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to be able to answer this question, because it has been 100 days since the Labor Party have asked me one question on skills training - which repeats the mistake of the 40th Parliament, when they did not ask any. With regard to the specifics of the member for Ballarat's question, let me advise that I have asked my department to make some direct inquiries into the MaxiTRANS new apprenticeship situation. We have been advised that the new apprentices in fact were being recruited through a local group training organisation. I have asked that group training organisation and the New Apprenticeships centres in the Ballarat region to work together to place with other host employers any new apprentices who were selected for MaxiTRANS and did not commence.But let us also deal with the sentiment that underscores this: a failure of the member for Ballarat - and, it seems, numbers of others opposite - to understand that the skilled migration program actually delivers a net benefit to the local community -  - and that it actually creates an opportunity for even more people to gain the apprenticeships that they might like to seek. Of course, over the years it has been developed to the point where as many as six or seven additional jobs can in fact be created -  - and opportunities given to more people as a result of employers in the local area working through the skilled migration program to bring people in directly to meet their company's needs. These people do not come here simply because they want to. Very simply, it is a process by which the employers have to advertise the vacancy nationally. If they satisfy the process in not being able to find an Australian-sourced person for that vacancy, they need agreement - including from the local state government, in particular - to be able to import that person.Just for the record, the member for Ballarat might be interested to know that there are approximately 3,000 apprentices in training in her electorate, which is a 292 per cent increase since 1996. So I would invite the member for Ballarat to celebrate the fact that a local business is investing in itself and the local region and creating more job opportunities for more young people around Ballarat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and acknowledge the considerable interest which he takes in promoting opportunities for mature age workers in his electorate of Casey. In last year's budget the government allocated $12.1 million to help mature age work seekers to continue to work and, indeed, made a further substantial commitment in the election platform last year. So the government is making a substantial commitment and providing substantial assistance to employers to assist mature age workers, but can I say that we also need to encourage employers to do more themselves. If one looks at the participation rate for people in Australia aged between 55 and 64, it stands at 53.4 per cent. This compares with the rates, for example, for the United Kingdom, which is at 57.5 per cent; the United States of America, which is at 62.4 per cent; and our nearest neighbour, New Zealand, which is at 66.8 per cent.Yesterday the government made announcements of awards to four companies under its Mature Age Workers Employer Champion awards. These are companies which have put in place policies not only to retain mature age workers but indeed to recruit older workers. I would like to commend those companies - the Westpac Banking Corporation, Socobell OEM of Spotswood in Melbourne, Aurora Energy in Tasmania and Magnet Mart here in Canberra - for their policies in developing age-friendly workplaces. One of the consequences of the ageing population in Australia will be a contraction in the coming years in the net growth of the Australian work force. Therefore, one of the measures which we are seeking to encourage employers and businesses throughout Australia to adopt is to retain and indeed to regain older workers.These proposals and this program stand in marked contrast to the program that the Leader of the Opposition employed when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, back in the previous government, and the member for Lilley was the chairman of the special caucus committee on long-term unemployment. Indeed, in May 1993, the then Labor government, with the Leader of the Opposition as the minister for employment, proposed the idea of paying old age pensions to unemployed people from the age of 55 and no longer counting them as part of the work force. So, instead of doing something to assist mature age workers, the policy of the Leader of the Opposition when he was last responsible for employment was simply to give up and to pension off these people from the work force. No wonder he told his biographer subsequently: 'I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining. I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than in just about anything that I had.' Instead of rising to the challenge to assist mature age workers, the Leader of the Opposition squibbed it. We will not do that.</DOC>

 - Finally, a question from the opposition directly to me. It has taken 100 days for them to actually raise apprenticeships directly with me. But, as I said the other day, there are lots of galahs in the pet shop, not just parrots. The Skills at work report showed that the number of completions of new apprenticeships has in fact increased by 280 per cent since 1996. Over the 12 months to June 2003, the period of the report, around 120,500 new apprenticeships were completed. We need to see the Australian Labor Party actually get behind the efforts of the government to keep encouraging the choices that young people make and to celebrate the process of choice that is at work in the marketplace today. The number of people starting apprenticeships across the board is up; the number of people starting apprenticeships in traditional trades is up; the completions are up; the funding is up. If only the Labor Party would actually have the good grace and decency to encourage young people to feel good about their choices, just as we are doing on this side of the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. She in particular and many members on this side have committed much of their adult lives to fighting for the fundamental principle that every Australian should be free to join a union, a guild or an association and be represented by that union if they so choose but that equally every Australian, whether they be in a workplace or a university campus, should be free to not join a union. This government will very shortly introduce legislation to give effect to the long-held Liberal principle that, when Australian university students - there are now 750,000 of them - arrive on campus each year, they should have the choice to join a union, a guild or association or equally they should be free not to join that union.I say to the members opposite, to the people who lecture us constantly from what they consider to be a social justice viewpoint: why should a single parent, a mother of two, who goes back to university to study nursing subsidise the abseiling club? Why should she subsidise buses to Woomera or the purchase of axes to break down the vice-chancellor's offices? Why is it that students who want to enrol in a diploma of language at Sydney University and who then have to do a course at ANU in India are sent a bill for ANU union fees, when all they want to do is to get an education at Sydney University? Why is it that a student in the 21st century goes to Sydney University to pay $2 for a sausage roll when they can buy one for $1.70 off campus and be served by a person who actually smiles at them? -  - I put this to the Australian Labor Party, which are opposed to Australian students having a choice to join a union: not a single word was said by the Labor Party when the sons and daughters of struggling families faced a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees in New South Wales - up-front charges from the New South Wales government - yet, here they are, railing against Australian students having the choice to join a union or not. This government will not be deterred from its course of action. This will be implemented in 2005.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I recall, and as the man in question has indicated, he indicated to me that he felt that you had become an ineffective member for that seat. He indicated, as indeed many members of the Tamworth business community have indicated to me, that they would like to see a change in representation. He himself said all of that in the Senate hearing the other day. So, in that sense, have members of the Tamworth business community talked to me about their representation? Yes. Did I say to him in some form or another that I had some offer to make to you? Very specifically, as I have said endlessly in this place, no I did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that yesterday's announcement of the new regulations, form and legislation going forward on the government's choice of superannuation fund from 1 July was very well received. In fact, Mr Richard Gilbert, the Chief Executive Officer of the Investment and Financial Services Association, said:This is a good result for investors and consumers.Whilst it is important that industry and business are engaged in and supportive of choice, the most important people in this equation are the consumers. I was particularly pleased to read an article in the Australian newspaper today which asked a typical young 23-year-old worker in the Sydney suburb of Bronte, Mr David Birtwell, about choice. He said that he was 'eager to control where his superannuation money was placed so he could ensure he paid minimum fees for maximum returns'. It is a pretty simple concept and one that we on this side of that House fully support. Mr Birtwell went on to say:I think it is definitely beneficial to have a choice. ... if I can choose, I will definitely take much more of an interest in it.It is very important that Australians take a very keen interest in their superannuation and choice will encourage them to do just that. I asked myself why those who sit opposite and their Labor state colleagues are opposed to choice, opposed to giving a fundamental right to average consumers to make what is probably the second largest financial decision of their lives beyond buying their own homes - that is, where they are going to place their superannuation, what sorts of fees they are going to be charged and what sorts of returns they expect to receive.The Labor Party are incapable of making these sorts of decisions on behalf of the public. They have now said that they do not believe Australian consumers should have a right to choose where their super funds go. Tom Barton, the Queensland Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations and a former union heavyweight in Queensland, proudly stated, when he reintroduced into the state parliament the removal of the little bit of choice that was there for state workers, that he had consulted with employers and unions. There was no suggestion that he had consulted with the people most affected, the workers themselves, the people whose money it is that is in choice. I encourage the Labor Party to think again, repudiate their current policy position and support choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I say the innuendo and the presumption that goes with that are disgusting and a disgrace. If he has an allegation to make he might first begin by declaring straight up and down whether he has confidence in the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who found that there was no case. The direct answer to his question is that there is no conflict whatsoever in terms of the substantive purpose for which I was requested to meet with Mr Maguire to talk about the proposed equine centre. We had a conversation about the matter that was at hand. No inducements were offered. Your implication somehow now that you want to make accusations, that you want to get into the swim of this, first demands that you make clear what your allegation is and whether or not in some way you are casting doubts on the findings of the Australian Federal Police. Later in the meeting -  -  - Yes, we went and looked at motorcycles. There is no conflict whatsoever between what I said then and what happened on the night - none.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and acknowledge that he has been a very successful small businessman in regional Victoria and is passionate about small business. We have 1.1 million small businesses in this country employing 3.3 million Australians. They play a very central role in the economy because they generate around 30 per cent of the economic production. The government values and recognises this contribution by small business and provides a range of assistance so that small business can grow. Programs like the 25 per cent entrepreneurs' tax discount will provide $1.1 billion of tax cuts to 300,000 small businesses. I am asked: are there disincentives for small business to grow and employ more people? I can tell the House that one of that biggest disincentives for small business is the hike in land tax that state Labor governments are applying to small business right around the country. The two states who are the worst offenders are New South Wales and Victoria. Victoria has increased its grab for land tax. -  - Mr Speaker, I think this is an important issue and I should be heard. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, Victoria has increased its grab for land tax by 123 per cent. The New South Wales grab for land tax this year is going to be $1.4 billion. On the ground, that means that small businesses like Dennison's Dry Cleaning in Camberwell in Victoria have had their land tax increased over the past five years from $947 to $20,500. It also means, on the ground, that the small business people running Arthur's Hotel in Arthur's Seat have had their land tax increased from $1,330 to $46,130. If the Leader of the Opposition had the slightest interest in small business, he would actually speak to his Labor counterparts in each of the states and convince them to reduce this burden on small business and give small business a fair go.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The simple point to be made in all this, as I made very plain last year and as I have reiterated every time I have been asked since, and I do so again today - and as is completely corroborated by Mr Maguire's testimony to the Senate committee last week - is that at no stage was any corrupt or inappropriate offer made or asked to be conveyed. In no way was there anything that is out of order in terms of the Electoral Act or in terms of decent behaviour. Are we at the point where a discussion, which inasmuch as it had to do with politics had to do with our candidate in that seat, should be fully reported in this House? - The main issue so far as the public interest is concerned is that no inducement was offered. The businessman at the centre of this confirmed that last week. - And there is no conflict whatsoever. There is not the slightest conflict or inconsistency between what I said last year and what I maintain and will continue to maintain until I depart this earth: no inappropriate offer was made.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the member for Forde's interest in aged care and thank her for arranging an aged care forum when I visited her electorate. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians receive not only high-quality care and choice in care but also high-quality accommodation if they need residential care. That is why the government introduced a 10-year certification program to ensure that by 2008 aged care homes meet community expectations in terms of building standards and the privacy and amenity in those homes. I am pleased to report to the House that already around 90 per cent of homes meet that 2008 certification standard.The sector is showing great confidence in the government's policies and continuing reform agenda in aged care. The most recent survey of aged care homes indicates that some $2 billion in private investment has been made either for work carried out or for work in progress to 30 June last year. Some 25 per cent or one in four homes report that they are planning new work in their homes. The Australian government committed almost a billion dollars over four years in the last budget in capital payments to aged care homes.In addition, recently I was able to announce the outcome of the 2004 allocation - a $40 million capital fund for rural and regional homes. I know, for example, that the member for Lingiari will be pleased that a home in Alice Springs in his electorate received $2½ million by way of a capital payment. Indeed, the member for Kennedy, whom I see here today, would also be pleased that the Fred Leftwich Rest Home received a $2½ million capital payment. I visited the Fred Leftwich hostel last year and I was very impressed with the work that they are doing in Mareeba for Aboriginal and Tourist Strait Islanders needing care. My colleague the member for Eden-Monaro has already indicated to me how pleased the people are at the Sir William Hudson Memorial Centre in his electorate, which is providing high care for people in rural areas. They have received a targeted grant of $1 million. So the combination of Australian government investment and private sector investment from the aged care sector, together with our ongoing reform program, is securing the future for aged care in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. My attention has been drawn to that very qualified conditional statement by the Italian Prime Minister. Let me say that the disposition of Italian forces in Iraq is a matter for the Italian government and the Italian people. I do not propose to comment on that particular statement except to observe that the Italian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and the building of a democratic Iraq has been exemplary. I want to praise the Italian Prime Minister. He has displayed great courage and great leadership within his own country, and the contribution that the Italians have made is something that we should be ready to praise and compliment. We should not seek to draw some kind of political advantage domestically from some statement that Silvio Berlusconi has made. In so far as the Australian position is concerned, I repeat what I said when I made the announcement about the additional 450. We do not have any current plans to increase that number but I cannot rule out some changes in the future and I do not intend to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I know that members on both sides of the House will welcome the fact that the President of Indonesia, President Yudhoyono, will pay an official visit to Australia between 31 March and 2 April this year. This visit will represent a further advance in the relations between our two countries. It will be the first visit to this country by an Indonesian president since the visit by President Wahid in June 2001, shortly before that gentleman ceased to be the President of Indonesia. That visit was the first that had taken place for a period of close to 30 years, the previous visit having been by President Suharto during the term in office of the Whitlam government.President Yudhoyono will bring to this visit a very strong commitment to the bilateral relationship. He is a person of great dignity and strength. He is a person who represents very much the new democratic future of Indonesia. Indonesia is now the third largest democracy in the world and it goes unremarked what that country has achieved in the last few years in its transition to democracy. Indonesia has suffered more than any other country as a result of the tsunami. It is well known to members on both sides of the House that the contribution that Australia has made to rebuilding the Aceh province after the tsunami has been second to none of those by nations around the world.I should also inform the House that the visit to Australia by President Yudhoyono will be preceded, on Friday this week, by the first meeting for some time of the joint ministerial council between Australia and Indonesia. There will be no fewer than nine ministers of the Indonesian government who will sit down with their counterparts in the Australian government here in Canberra on Friday not only to exchange policy experiences but also to further build the bilateral relationship. In addition to that, on Thursday afternoon - that is, tomorrow - there will be the first meeting, which I will briefly attend, of the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. This is the joint body that was established by President Yudhoyono and me and that will oversee the disbursement of the $1 billion aid package - the largest in Australia's history - that has been made available in the wake of the tsunami. I take this opportunity of saying again to the parliament that none of that money can be disbursed except with the joint approval of the governments of Indonesia and Australia. At that meeting Australia will be represented by the Treasurer and the foreign minister. Their counterparts on the Indonesian side will be the foreign minister and the minister for planning.In conclusion, can I say that the state of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia owes a great deal to the efforts of many people. I want to pay particular tribute to the efforts of many of my own ministers, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs. His relationship with his counterpart in the Indonesian government, Hassan Wirajuda, is a very integral part of the relationship. Very importantly, can I also record the value of the links between the Australian Federal Police, their counterparts in the Indonesian government and also the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Both of those agencies have developed the closest possible relationships with their Indonesian counterparts, and of course those relationships were very material in catching those responsible for the terrible attack in Bali which murdered 88 Australians in October 2002.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the member for Griffith that the statement made by the Italian Prime Minister is a lot more conditional than you have implied. I am reminded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is conditional on the Iraqis being able to take over from the Italians. As to any implications for us, naturally they will be assessed, but let me make it clear that we have taken a decision, properly based on the advice we have received, to provide a secure environment for some Japanese forces which are providing valuable humanitarian work.I know he might not like to be reminded of it, but I recall, amongst the many pieces of correspondence I received on Iraq, a very well argued letter from the member for Griffith after he had returned from a visit to Baghdad. I think it would have been in 2002. He said we had 'a solemn duty' - I think he may have actually used that expression - to provide more humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq and that we should provide more support for training. With the very greatest of respect, can I remind the member for Griffith that the two purposes of the deployment of the 450 Australian troops are to provide a secure environment for the Japanese who are providing humanitarian assistance and to provide further training for the Iraqi forces.In the long run, I think even the member for Griffith would concede that the basis for the Iraqis being able to run their own affairs is the training and development of adequate internal and external defence and security forces made up of Iraqis. We are making a contribution to that, and those who sit opposite seek to frustrate and to snipe at our endeavours to do so. They will not be successful.</DOC>

 - That is a very good question from the member for Solomon. We recognise how important Australia's export effort is for the Northern Territory, which he represents very well. It is important to note a few statistical facts. That is something that eludes the Labor Party - they do not like talking in facts; only a great deal of fiction. The export recovery which began in mid-2003 has continued into 2004 and 2005 led by strong world demand for resources. Of course, that is being driven by the extraordinary growth in China. Export values grew by 8.3 per cent in 2004 and delivered an export figure of $152.5 billion worth of products out of Australia. I have said before in this place that that is the second highest figure that we have ever achieved in exports as a nation. While volumes may have only grown by four per cent, it is still a significant figure.Export earnings in the first half of 2004-05 are up by 13 per cent over the same period in 2003-04. Treasury's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook forecasts export volumes to rise by four per cent in 2004-05, reflecting strong global demand for non-rural commodities. As I indicated earlier, resource exports are expected to rise even further as new projects come on stream in Australia and the growth in demand externally continues, particularly in areas like iron ore, coal and liquefied natural gas. Obviously this is being driven by the growth in China.The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has forecast a 16 per cent growth in exports of resources out of Australia in 2005-06. Of course, as we have debated in this place in recent times and publicly, there is one impediment to this and that is being able to get bulk commodities through the bulk ports in Australia that are controlled by the states, which will have an impact on the final result. ABARE has also forecast that farm export earnings are to increase by around 2.5 per cent in 2004-05. It was not too many years ago that we suffered the worst drought we have ever had in this country and there are many parts of this country still suffering from this significant drought. Yet ABARE is forecasting a 2.5 per cent increase in exports from the farm sector in 2004-05.Onto the services sector: one of the largest exporters within that sector is tourism. According to the Tourism Forecasting Committee, strong growth in international tourism arrivals is expected to continue. The forecasting committee expects tourism export earnings to rise by 5.8 per cent in 2005, and that is off a very strong base. This is obviously mainly due to international visitor arrivals, but it is an area that is very important in our services sector.The indication for growth prospects as far as our export earnings are concerned is strong. International markets are indicating growth and strength, particularly in East Asia. It is also interesting to note that the terms of trade are currently at record highs. In MYEFO the terms of trade are forecast to increase by 4.5 per cent in 2004-05, with a further increase in 2005-06. When we come to some of the fundamentals that a government has control of - that is, the policy settings - our government has been very assertive since 1996 in exercising and pursuing policies that open up markets across the world. We have also been very active in prosecuting the case for more reform domestically, within our own economy, to try and maintain the efficient and competitive advantage that we need to have. So it is only good policy, good management and delivering on productivity gains that will maintain the competitive edge for Australia and continue to deliver the export growth that we have had in recent years.</DOC>

 - I can say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that he must have been focusing on something else whilst the Minister for Trade was going through the prospects that lie ahead of us. Let me remind him of the ABARE forecast of a 16 per cent increase. Let me remind him of the enormous increases that will kick in in April this year in relation to exports of many of our mining products. Let me caution the Leader of the Opposition against grabbing hold of the past current account deficit figures in order to criticise the government's economic performance. Let me read something to the Leader of the Opposition. He may or may not have had this brought to his attention. It is a piece that I came across in a little bit of research in relation to the future of the economy. It has this to say about recent economic developments:The major weakness was in declining housing construction - a sector long due for a downturn. A great deal depends on stronger export growth but there is nothing in the numbers for 2004 to preclude solidly increasing output in employment between now and the next federal election. Global growth may well be down this year but the United States, China, Japan, most of the rest of East Asia and to a lesser extent Europe will continue to expand, underpinning Australia's export growth. If export growth increases and import growth fades, as I expect, the current account deficit at the end of this year will be a little narrower than at the end of last year.They are not John Howard's words or the words of the Treasurer. They are the words of John Edwards in an article 'Home truths for Labor', posted on the web site under the heading of NewMatilda.com. The last time I saw John Edwards on television, he was in the company of the Leader of the Opposition at the launch of a book that Edwards had written on the economic credentials of a former Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin.Can I conclude with another extract from John Edwards, which really bears very heavily on this whole debate. He had this to say:The Australian economy is not merely prosperous. In many respects the recent economic experience is the best Australians have ever enjoyed. Later this year the economy will highly likely begin the fifteenth year of uninterrupted expansion, a record unmatched since European settlement. In the last fourteen years real household wealth has doubled, a bigger increase than occurred over the previous forty years. Average real income has increased by nearly half. Average real earnings have increased by nearly one third. There are two million more jobs today than there were fourteen years ago, a much bigger increase than in the previous fourteen years. The proportion of working Australians to the whole population is at a twenty seven year high. Unemployment is now hovering just above 5 per cent, a twenty five year low.I am indebted to John Edwards for such an objective analysis of the state of the Australian economy. I thank him for providing such a valuable answer to the person whom he accompanied in the launch of his book on Curtin.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. He would be aware that earlier in the week there was a lot of interest in an OECD report called Taxing wages. This report attempts to take an average production worker across the 30 countries of the OECD and then compare their after-tax with benefits position across those 30 countries and across the years. It does this in relation to eight different profiles, taking 67 per cent of the average production worker's income, 100 per cent, 133 per cent and 167 per cent. I want to inform the House what this analysis shows, where Australia was and where it is in relation to the after-tax, after benefits income of the average production worker at those different levels.For a single worker with no children, on 67 per cent of the average income, in 1996 Australia had the third highest after-tax position in the OECD; in 2004 Australia had the second highest in the OECD. For a single person on 100 per cent, in 1996 Australia was the fifth highest in the OECD; in 2004 Australia was the second highest in the OECD. For a single person with no children, on 167 per cent of wages, in 1996 Australia was the sixth highest in the OECD; in 2004 it was the second highest in the OECD. For a married person on 100 per cent of income, with two children, in 1996 Australia was the sixth highest in the OECD; in 2004 it was the highest in the OECD. For a married person with two children, on 133 per cent, in 1996 Australia was the fourth highest in the OECD; in 2004 Australia was the highest in the OECD. For a married person with two children, on 167 per cent, in 1996 Australia was the fifth highest in the OECD; in 2004 it was the highest in the OECD. For a married person with no children, on 133 per cent of income, in 1996 Australia had the fifth highest net income - after taxes - and in 2004 it was second of the 30 countries of the OECD.What that report shows is that, on the average production worker's income at those different amounts, Australians - after tax, with their family tax benefits - are either the highest or the second highest of the 30 rich countries of the world and have improved across every cameo since 1996. I think members of this House will think that that does represent success in policy - that Australians on average, production worker incomes, after tax and after benefits, are either the top in the world or the second top in the world in terms of their after-tax income.A big part of that has been not just the improvement in tax and family benefits but the fact that wages have been increasing over the period 1996 to 2004. Over the period of 1996 to 2004, Australian workers have had real wages growth of 11.9 per cent, compared to an OECD average of 10.8 per cent. So their wages have been increasing faster than the OECD average, but it was not always the case. I ask the House to listen very carefully to this: from 1983 to 1996, the period when the previous government was in office, the average real wage growth in the OECD was 8.3 per cent. In Australia it was 3.3 per cent - not even half the OECD average. In fact, from March 1983 to March 1991 the real wages of Australian workers actually fell by 4.2 per cent.Those of us who were here in those days - and I was - can remember the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer coming to this dispatch box and their proudest boast was that they had depressed real wages. They would measure the success of their policy by the amount by which real wages had declined. I want to say to the House: this side of the House has always believed that if we have a strong economy average workers in Australia should have rising incomes based on productivity improvements and on a tax system which delivers better to them and which has now taken them to the top or the second position amongst the economies of the world.</DOC>

 - I certainly remember statements I made about the current account deficit when I was in opposition and I certainly remember the economic circumstances in which those statements were made. It is true that there are very heavy borrowings overseas by Australians: by Australian individuals and by Australian corporations. In fact, one of the consequences of a strong economy is that individuals and corporations borrow both domestically and overseas. But I think the member for Hotham will acknowledge that one of the big differences between now and when I spoke in 1995 is that now the government itself is not contributing to the borrowing demand. It does not have any budget deficit; it has a budget surplus - and the government is not making any contribution because the government has had a budget that has been very heavily in surplus for some years.Let me remind the member for Hotham that over the past three years the Australian mining industry has invested about $26½ billion in the expansion of productive capacity and, as this new capacity comes online, Australia's exports of mineral commodities should increase significantly. Furthermore, increases in export prices, many of which come into effect in April 2005, will benefit our external accounts in the period ahead. The contract price for iron ore, for example, has risen by 70 per cent and metallurgical coal in excess of 100 per cent. And the Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics published forecasts suggesting a 16 per cent growth in our commodity export earnings in 2005-06.Could I also remind the member for Hotham that Australia's ability to manage and service its foreign debt through export earnings has improved markedly in recent years. The net foreign debt servicing ratio rose to 9.3 per cent in the December quarter 2004. This remains well below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in 1990, and below the 1990s average of 13 per cent. Can I say that of course we have a large current account deficit - the government is not disputing that - but there is every reason, as I said in the House a few days ago, to believe that that situation will improve. That is a belief that is shared by reputable economists on both sides of Australian politics.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and for her interest. Today, 16 March, is the anniversary of Saddam Hussein's attack with chemical weapons against his own people in Halabja in 1988, and it is also the date the Iraqis have chosen for the Transitional National Assembly, elected in the elections on 30 January, to convene. We congratulate Iraq on this election and on the convening of the Transitional National Assembly, and I am glad we have supported it. We have so far committed $126 million of assistance for Iraq's rehabilitation and reconstruction. For example, we are providing technical experts to assist with the re-establishment of Iraqi government services. We have people working in areas like the electricity generation sector. We have provided significant support for the Iraqi elections ourselves. We have Australian Federal Police officers training Iraqi police. We have agriculture ministry officials who are being trained by Australians. I think we have about 25 of them in Australia at the moment.I would draw the House's attention to the fact that Soccer Australia has arranged a soccer game between Australia and Iraq in Sydney in the honourable member's home town on 26 March. I would urge all members who possibly can to go to the match and to support the team that represents Australia, of course, but also to give encouragement to the Iraqi national soccer team - after all, that is a team that now represents a freed people.Other countries are providing assistance as well. There has been some questioning today by the opposition about Italy, somehow suggesting that the Italian Prime Minister would be akin to the man whose name is not spoken in this House any more. But I will breach the protocol and say the name: Mark Latham. 'Troops out by Christmas' was the Labor Party's policy in the lead-up to the last election. Actually, what the Italian Prime Minister has done is provide significant numbers of troops to assist Iraq and show great courage in doing so. It has not always been popular in Italy, but Silvio Berlusconi has shown great courage in sending troops. Those troops have performed admirably. The Italian parliament - the Chamber of Deputies, the equivalent of the House of Representatives - yesterday voted by 246 to 180 to keep the troops -  
Government member - And other forms of assistance. - The only point I would make about Silvio Berlusconi is that they have got a six-month extension for the troops. He said the question of withdrawing the contingent 'will depend on the capacity of the Iraqi government to give itself an acceptable security structure'.Finally, I know members of the opposition are interested in what is happening in their brother party, the British Labour Party. I have mentioned before Harry Barnes, my parents-in-laws' own local MP, the member for North-East Derbyshire, and his establishment of the UK Labour Friends of Iraq. The Labour Friends of Iraq have established a 'Toolkit on Solidarity with Grassroots Iraq'. I have a copy of the toolkit here, and members of the Labor Party can apply to my office for copies of the toolkit because it is for Labour members of parliament. What the Labour Friends of Iraq say is this:'We should not walk away when the going gets tough ... we must do everything we can to help the people build a democratic country.'_            _            _The Iraqi democrats need you - Labour members of parliament - in their hour of need.And British Labour members of parliament are helping the Iraqi people. They are helping the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions, the teachers union and other members of the labour movement in Iraq. They are supporting them against the insurgents and the forces of tyranny. And what happens in Australia? The Labor Party, the cut-and-run party on Iraq, is now, as of course we know - </DOC>

 - Actually, I have not the faintest idea what the question was, but I will have a go at it. As to the first part of the question, the answer is yes. As to the second part of the question, which was highly defamatory of my government, the answer is no. Finally, given the confected exuberance of the Leader of the Opposition, I would like to read out a piece of advice contained in the article by Mr Edwards. It reads:But it would be foolish indeed for Labor to imagine the long run of prosperity is over.Everything about the behaviour of the Australian Labor Party has been predicated in the hope that, in some way, the good economic times of the last few years are over. Our warning to you, and Mr Edwards's warning to you, is that it is not over and you would be very foolish to get too excited about a few numbers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. I can advise him that Australia's largest export is coal, and it was worth over $13 billion in 2004. Hay Point is the biggest coal port in Queensland, and the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal is one of the largest in the world. Australian coal producers have just struck a deal with Japanese steelmakers to lift coking coal export prices from $US57 a tonne to $US120 a tonne. According to newspaper reports, 50 ships are now queued outside the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal and the owner expects 31 more ships to arrive by the end of the month. The average wait before a ship can load has increased to 23 days, and Australia's coalminers are paying $2.4 million a day in demurrage to wait for those ships to come in and load. The Dalrymple Bay coal terminal is owned by Prime Infrastructure, a floated infrastructure trust of the merchant bank Babcock and Brown. An argument between the users and the owner about the rate of return on any new investment -  - I love the way the member for Hunter comes in on cue - was referred to the Queensland Competition Authority for a decision 20 months ago. - The Queensland Competition Authority, which has now had the matter for 20 months, is yet to give a final decision, whilst 50 ships queue and the demurrage cost is $2.4 million a day. Once the Queensland Competition Authority gives an arbitrated decision after having been seized of this matter for 20 months, if the owner of the port, the private infrastructure trust, were to decide to build a new loader it would probably take between 12 and 24 months from start to finish. The only thing I can say, having discussed this with the owners and the users -  - I note, for the sake of the record, that Labor Party members are intervening in support of the Queensland Competition Authority and its 20-month delay in giving the decision. They are intervening in defence of the Queensland -  The member for Hunter then left the chamber. 
 - I would say to any other infrastructure -  - With respect to the Queensland Competition Authority, I would point out that parties can either come to agreements in relation to this matter - which may be a much faster way of resolving the problem - or, alternatively, there is provision for a declaration under the Trade Practices Act which will allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to intervene in areas of national infrastructure and to make timely decisions which can resolve these disputes. That may be an alternative, which is open to the parties if this matter should drag on any longer in the Queensland jurisdiction in a way which is now affecting Australia's vital national interests in our No. 1 coal export.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Ballarat that I do not seek to avoid addressing this issue. I am now in a position to say something more about it, as my office and my department have been in touch with a number of people concerned with this matter, which has received considerable publicity. We have been in touch with the group training company to establish what is being done to assist a further seven young people who were not placed by group training with the MaxiTRANS company. My advice is that it is not accurate to say that the skilled Chinese workers were displacing apprentices. The two are not substitutes. The Chinese workers in question were fully trained.I am advised that the decision to source skilled workers from overseas was taken last year, and the process commenced in the last half of last year. This was before the arrangements for the 2005 intake of apprentices were made. I have very considerable sympathy for the situation of the young man who was interviewed on national radio this morning, but there is all the world of difference between a company making a decision last year to bring in some skilled workers where there is a need for immediately trained people and -  - It should not be said that in some way that is unfairly disadvantaging people who are about to start - therefore, by definition, having had no training. I therefore think the criticism of that arrangement and of the actions of that company are misplaced. I have been asked a question about training, and I have been asked a question about skills, and there have been allegations of a skills crisis. For the last two or three weeks the Leader of the Opposition has been running around the country saying, 'I warned you years ago that there was a skills crisis; I was out there years ago.' In fact, on 12 March this year the Leader of the Opposition said, 'What this country needs is opportunities for young people to become plumbers, electricians, hairdressers and mechanics. The Labor Party has been talking about that for the past five years.' When I heard him say that, I thought, 'Gee, that is not the man I remember as Leader of the Opposition a few years ago,' so I rummaged through a few old files. It is amazing, but I came across a comely little publication called Work force 2010: securing your future. Needless to say, this is a document of the Australian Labor Party. It is a very good one, but it did not have too much to say about plumbers or electricians. This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say:We need to lift the numbers of apprentices and trainees in the sales, marketing, retail, health, education, welfare and hospitality - read 'Hungry Jacks' - if we are to meet the future demand.That document had nothing to say about the need to lift the number of people in the traditional trades area because, unlike what he is saying now, the Leader of the Opposition -  - I want to quote once more from this little publication. It shows us how able the Leader of the Opposition was to predict the future. He said:On current trends the industries most at risk of declining jobs over the next 10 years are communications, electricity, gas, water and mining. Many of the workers in these industries may find jobs in other industries.The Leader of the Opposition is, in every sense of the word, a Johnny-come-lately to the contemporary debate about skills in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that I was able to visit Mildura recently. The Sunraysia region is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. In fact, I think it is the 10th largest growth centre in Australia. It is focused around water, irrigation development and our export performance. I think Econtech are pretty well known in this House and are pretty well respected for their work. They have recently done some work for the Australian Farm Institute and Horticulture Australia. That has resulted in a report called Australia's farm-dependent economy. It will probably surprise many Australians - and I say this with the best will in the world - who sit in the cafes of the big cities, enjoying the high quality food and fibre that our farmers produce, that they can probably thank farmers not only for the food and fibre they enjoy at such low prices but for their jobs as well.Amazingly, it is often said that the farm sector constitutes only 3.2 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, but that very significantly underestimates the importance of the sector when you include all of the industries that support agriculture and the industries that depend on it. For example, the farm sector provides almost half the total inputs used by the meat and dairy products manufacturing industry. Econtech added all of this together and concluded that the farm dependent sector contributes more than 12 per cent of Australia's GDP. That sector employs 1.6 million people, 17 per cent of the labour force - and some 800,000 people in the major cities of Australia.I was asked about programs to support farmers. The most critical thing you can do for the farm sector is to keep interest rates low. It is worth recording that when the Leader of the Opposition was in government - when I came into this place 16 years ago - farmers were paying 22 per cent or 23 per cent interest. The other day I took the trouble to check what a farmer who wanted to borrow some money to expand would pay today; it is under 7.5 per cent. That is a third of what the rate was 16 years ago. So, sound economic management is the first and most important thing the government can do. You can add industrial relations reform to that - and nowhere has that been more evident than in our ports, where the lift in our productivity has been huge despite the fact that the Labor Party said it could never be done. - We are currently experiencing a drought, and I know that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry shares my concern about the desperate need for rain across most of eastern Australia. We are providing about $1 billion worth of support directly to farmers. Work has been done by the Minister for Trade in opening up further trade opportunities everywhere for the farm sector. The National Water Initiative has provided investment security for better environmental and economic outcomes. We have introduced the Roads to Recovery program - because every farm product starts its journey on a rural or regional road somewhere - and we are getting the roads back into condition. There has been talk about infrastructure. - The Leader of the Opposition called it a boondoggle! Just about everything we value-add and everything that those 800,000 jobs in the major cities depend upon, starts out on a country road - and we are helping to restore the roads.</DOC>

 - I suppose I should say that I could take the question in writing with a grain of salt! Behind the facile nature of the question is a very serious issue. When Australian students arrive at Australian universities in 2006, as far as this government is concerned they should be given the choice as to whether or not they will join the student union. There are many young people in the gallery today whom I suspect may be at university next year or the year after, and they should have the choice as to whether they will have $500 or $600 removed from their hard-earned dollars to join a student union, guild or association. If they want to join the Lego club at the University of Queensland, they can. If they want to join the fruit carving club at Sydney University, they can.Yesterday I made the point that, if you are an Australian student on campus today paying $600 in student union fees for subsidised services, why is it that when you turn up at the cafeteria at Manning you will pay $2 for a sausage roll, but, if you go across the road - and I will give the Leader of the Opposition and the white bread politicians on the other side an opportunity to write this down - to the Crispy Inn Bakery in King Street, Newtown, you will pay $1.70 for a sausage roll? And, in fact, you will get a very warm reception from someone who is in a traineeship. Further, if you go to the Newtown Bakery in King Street, you will pay $1.80 and get service with a smile.In terms of reading documents, I am not familiar with the 1978 publication, but I am very, very familiar with the February publication of the Southern Highlands branch of the Labor Party as written by Rodney Cavalier, which was published again in the Sydney Morning Herald last Saturday. - According to Alan Ramsey, Mr Cavalier was 'unsparing' when he said:Kim Beazley diminishes himself by asserting Macklin is the goods. She is a dud, gold and rolled - You are going to love this one, Mr Speaker:Given opposition is about making speeches to get a point across, this woman is a dead weight -  - I will come back to the question and will come back to Mr Cavalier again in question time. He said:Unafraid of a cliche, predictable to the point of tedium, you can always finish a sentence for her (and wish most devoutly that you could) - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. Yes, I did read reports that the ACTU was meeting yesterday to discuss a proposed campaign against the government's workplace reforms. It reminded me of the hysterical campaign that was launched back in 1996 when the government made substantial reforms to workplace relations in Australia. When I looked back at what the ALP had to say then, the then shadow minister - the member for Fraser - laid down five criteria by which he said the government's package would be judged. The criteria were: would it lead to fewer disputes, more jobs, a fairer distribution of wages, higher productivity and low inflation, and a low interest rate environment?I am pleased to report that the Workplace Relations Act has led to those outcomes. In fact, the government's reforms since 1996 have delivered a 12 per cent growth in real wages, the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years, the lowest number of strikes ever, higher productivity and more family-friendly work practices - and all that against a background of low inflation and low interest rates in this country.One has to ask: what does the ACTU propose to protest against - higher wages? Do they propose to protest against lower unemployment in this country? These reforms, like the others that this government has put in place, have led to better outcomes for ordinary working Australians and their families. Not only is the proposed campaign by the ACTU premature and reactionary, but it is no wonder that today in the private sector in Australia four out of five workers have walked away from trade unions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The government has conducted a thorough review of the community care sector, with wide consultation throughout the aged care sector over the past two, almost three, years. That resulted in a document, 'The Way Forward', which is the government's approach to community care, including to the community services the member referred to. This document was released in August 2004. In January of this year, in line with the recommendations in that document which was published widely last August, the government notified all services that there would be an invitation to apply for new services. We are not cutting services. This is an opportunity for service providers to apply to provide new services to older Australians in the community. That letter was sent in January. The invitation to apply was published in the newspapers on 5 March. The tenders - the invitation to apply - and the process will be completed by 30 June, at which time old contracts will cease, and so no service will in fact be cut and people will continue to receive community services as they did previously.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Makin for her question. I am happy to inform the House and put on the public record that Australia is as well prepared as any other country in the world for a possible outbreak of avian flu. That is not just my judgment, that is the judgment of the World Health Organisation. -  - There is a caterwauling opposite. - In last year's budget the government committed $114 million to purchase antivirals and, thanks to that foresight, Australia now has the world's largest stockpile on a per capita basis. Also in last year's budget the government provided $10 million to increase our disease surveillance capacity and $4 million to upgrade our laboratory analysis capacity. The government has a binding agreement with two of the largest vaccine manufacturers in the world to provide guaranteed supplies of a new vaccine against pandemic flu. Should it become available, the government can install thermal imaging equipment at all of the international airports in this country within a few hours of any pandemic outbreak. Since early last year all baggage coming to Australia from countries affected by bird flu has been routinely screened, and quarantine authorities have seized more than 1.5 tonnes of poultry contraband. There have been three previous outbreaks of pandemic flu known in this country. I can say that, thanks largely to the good work of federal and state health officials as part of the National Influenza Pandemic Action Committee, Australia is far better prepared than ever before. Certainly in the judgment of the World Health Organisation, it is as well prepared as any country in the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. No such condition was ever placed on the funding by me or by anybody else. Indeed, the Tamworth businessman who gave evidence to the Senate last week made precisely the same point. He said that he had suggested, as I understand it, to a couple of members of the committee that it might be advisable, and the committee might work more effectively, if there was no politician on it. But there were no conditions attached by me or by any emissary of mine. He gave that testimony to the Senate. He made it absolutely plain that he had not been advised as the chairman of the committee by me or by anyone else that there was a conditionality in terms of Mr Windsor's presence on the committee and the funding of the equine centre. He did make it plain that he had accepted the chairmanship of the Tamworth equine centre at the request of the member for New England, and he made it plain that, as he started to look over it, he became aware that the member for New England had been quite ineffective in pulling the whole thing together. -  - You asked the question. He said that the member for New England had not only failed to interact effectively with the federal government but he had failed completely to pull the local community together, specifically the P&amp;A Association who own the showground. I think the best thing I can do is refer those opposite to the Senate hearings and to the extensive evidence given by the chairman of the equine centre committee over a 2½-hour period, and they will find in that a very detailed rebuttal of this particular claim and many others as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I know he represents a number of organisations that are instrumental in helping us in relation to defence and security issues. Of course, the government's response to the global threat of terrorism in the wake of September 11 and of the Bali bombings closer to home was swift and decisive. We have been constantly working with our security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies here in Australia, as well as with the owners of critical infrastructure, to ensure that the Australian community is effectively protected against the threat of terrorism.But Australia will not defeat terrorism by acting alone, and that is why we have put a high priority on strengthening our cooperation with neighbours and, where required, offering assistance in capacity building. Never before have we been as engaged with our region on both government and operational levels. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have liaison partners right across the region, and ASIO continues to monitor individuals such as those with links to al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and their affiliates. Australian agencies are continuing to work closely together with overseas authorities to counter the terrorist threat in our region. We base our decisions on allocating resources dealing with counter-terrorism on assessment of threat. Our advice indicates that, in our immediate region, JI retains a high capability of carrying out attacks. The Australian embassy bombing last year I think demonstrated that point very cogently. But, not surprisingly, I understand the member for Griffith had some things to say about these matters yesterday in the House. Our approach has always been to take advice from competent authorities about where best to direct our efforts and not gratuitous advice. Let me just say I heard nothing yesterday from the member for Griffith that would prompt me to alter that approach.</DOC>

 - I have met Senator Lightfoot. Senator Lightfoot has prepared a statement which he signed, and which I now table. That statement covers the material allegations that have been made. Let me read a few excerpts from the statement. I do not intend to read the entire statement. In relation to the allegation about the money, the statement says as follows:I did not take $US20,000 in cash with me to Iraq. The only money I took with me was $US1,000 of my own money for personal expenses. I have a receipt. At no stage have I ever received, nor have I carried, nor have I given to the Kurdish regional government or the PUK or any agent or officer thereof, $US20,000. In relation to the gun, as also noted in my report - I am reading here from his statement - I was offered the use of a 38 calibre pistol by my Iraqi national guard detail. 
Opposition members - Ha, ha! - And:They were obviously genuinely concerned for my safety.Whilst those opposite may find that amusing, I do not think in the circumstances of Iraq it is an unreasonable precaution to provide somebody with a pistol. The statement continues:While I did take the weapon from them, I was uncomfortable with it and did not subsequently carry it. Indeed, I left it secured in one of the vehicles in which I was travelling.On the basis of the statement that has been provided by Senator Lightfoot, I find the response in that statement to the allegations entirely credible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can inform him that, after question time today, the inaugural meeting of the Joint Commission for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership on Reconstruction and Development will be taking place. This commission is chaired by President Yudhoyono and the Prime Minister of Australia. Attending the meeting this afternoon will be Foreign Minister Downer and his counterpart Wirajuda and also, on the economics side, me and Minister for National Development Planning Indrawati from Indonesia.This commission was announced in the wake of the terrible tsunami disaster which struck on Boxing Day and which killed an estimated 290,000 people. It was the largest announcement of aid that Australia has ever made - a package of $1 billion in response to that tsunami for reconstruction in Aceh - and it is not just for reconstruction in Aceh, but also for economic assistance more generally and more widely to Indonesia. We hope that this commission will draw our two countries together. It will have a practical work program overseeing reconstruction, but in addition to that it will strengthen the economic fundamentals of our countries. Our experience in Australia has been that sustained growth cannot take place without a strong framework of institutions, a strong framework of property rights and strong management. As part of the partnership for reconstruction and development, we will also be announcing a capacity to help Indonesia strengthen its institutions - a government partnership fund will play a role in helping Indonesia strengthen its institutions and governance. That will help Indonesia to get strong institutions, which will assist it in economic development generally, promoting rising living standards for its people and, of course, in a stronger economy, giving it greater capacity to engage in the reconstruction which has been necessitated by this terrible natural disaster.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to answer this question, given that -  -  - there has been a threefold increase in the number of apprentices in the electorate of Ballarat during the time of this government. In fact, in 2004 this government provided $7.8 million in incentives -  - to firms in the electorate of Ballarat. That is the sort of work that we have done. We heard Chris on Radio National yesterday talking about his ambition to have an apprenticeship, and I certainly commend him and others like him who want a trade apprenticeship. We are doing our bit to support them. But what is really important to know is that the member for Ballarat has been running around absolutely bagging the company MaxiTRANS -  - a company that in fact has been doing the heavy lift of hiring apprentices in that region. There are something like 57 apprentices on the books at MaxiTRANS right now. This company, with operations in other parts of Victoria and also in Queensland, will soon have 80 apprentices on their books. They have 400 staff. That is an excellent proportion of apprentices compared to the total number of staff.I think we need to actually get all of this into some context. There is no way on earth that, as has been suggested by those opposite, a skilled migrant arriving in Australia can substitute in the role of an apprentice. It is fundamentally impossible for that to occur. But we need to understand that this company is very well organised, geared towards apprenticeships, geared towards growing its business and geared towards growing the economy of the area around Ballarat - and as part of its plans it wants to make certain that it has the critical mass of skilled workers in its work force. MaxiTRANS has made it very, very clear that it continues to want to work with the local community and grow the local economy by these means. The other point that needs to be understood - and this is where the member for Ballarat, the member for Jagajaga and a couple of the other duds on the other side are completely exposed -  - is that these apprentices, Chris and his mates, have been employed by the group training organisation in the local area. They have not been without a job at all. They have not had an opportunity to get a host placement with MaxiTRANS on this occasion, but work is being done to ensure that their ambitions of an apprenticeship are being realised. The member for Ballarat is very clearly exposed on this, running around and telling people around the country that these kids have missed out on a job when they already had one. They were already placed in the group training organisation. The member for Ballarat and her colleagues on the other side would be wise not to follow the jargoning exercise of the member for Jagajaga but to put a bit of substance into the discussion and back companies like MaxiTRANS that are in fact doing the heavy lift of hiring apprentices.I table a statement from MaxiTRANS yesterday which outlines very clearly their commitment to the cause of getting more young people trained. This government works very hard on that. Ideally we want young people trained and into these skilled labour positions, but in the meantime we respect the decisions of companies like MaxiTRANS to grow their business case and create more opportunities for more young people to have more jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. He is the member representing Roxby Downs and has been a champion of that great mine which has done so much for South Australia. It originally was opposed by the Australian Labor Party.When I was in China in August of last year the Chinese officials I was with raised with me the possibility of buying uranium from Australia, and I explained to them then that that could only be done if we were able to enter into a satisfactory nuclear safeguards agreement consistent with longstanding Australian government policy - a safeguards agreement which would be akin to the safeguards agreements we have with a number of other countries and arrangements we have with the other nuclear weapons states.As a result of this we have started the process of negotiating with China a nuclear safeguards agreement. The Director General of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office visited Beijing at the end of February, and I think China understands very clearly what our policy is on uranium exports. We cannot be sure yet, but I have some quiet confidence that we might be able to negotiate a satisfactory safeguards agreement which is consistent with our broad policy and with the other agreements we have. This agreement will have to be a treaty-level agreement, and any agreement of this kind will be subject to the usual scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.The government wants to take full advantage of Australia's competitive position in the uranium industry. China is the world's second largest energy consumer, behind the United States. Its electricity demand is growing rapidly, by around 13 per cent a year, and it is seeking to diversify from fossil fuels. China plans to build four nuclear power plants between now and 2020. So China will become a uranium importer. As long as the safeguards agreement can be concluded, we would not see any further obstacles to exporting uranium to China.More broadly, this is a government that believes that safeguards agreements are necessary but that, within that framework, we should be able to mine and export uranium. Are there any other views? There is the Labor Party view. There are many people in the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, who believe in the so-called three mines policy. This is, of course, a policy of deceit. It is trying to convince people, 'We are not too much in favour of uranium mining but we are going to allow uranium mining.' It is a policy without commonsense, without rationality and without consistency. Not surprisingly again from the Labor Party, it is a policy that does not offer Australia jobs. They are always talking about the balance of payments. It does not offer Australia the opportunity to maximise its export earnings. It is completely irrational policy. I join with the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, in urging the Labor Party to abandon this nonsensical policy. If the Leader of the Opposition is a real leader, I am sure he will abandon it.</DOC>

 - The newspaper has made an allegation; Senator Lightfoot has responded. His response is now on the public record, and it will no doubt be trawled over by people and it will be available for examination by law enforcement authorities. I do not propose in those circumstances to commission some kind of independent analysis of it any more than I would propose to commission an independent analysis of contesting statements made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Sydney Daily Telegraph.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can tell him that, as a result of the initiative of this government, the parliament has now passed a law cutting tax for small businesses in Australia. Known as the entrepreneurs tax discount, it will deliver a benefit to 540,000 Australian small businesses. With a turnover of up to $50,000, small entrepreneurs and small business people can get 25 per cent off the tax they are currently liable for. If they are a company and they pay tax at the 30c rate, they would be obliged at the moment to pay $15,000 of tax. A 25 per cent tax discount will reduce their tax liability by $3,750, which is a decent tax cut. If they are individuals and they have $50,000 of taxable income, their tax would be $11,172, and a 25 per cent discount would reduce that by $2,793. They are decent tax cuts for small businesses in Australia, up to 25 per cent on a turnover of $50,000.Why has the government again cut tax for small business? This side of the House believes that it is important to encourage small business. Small businesses are people who go out and risk their savings and create jobs. Small businesses are independent people. Small businesses are people who take responsibility. They are the people that get an economy going, and they are the people that deserve the kinds of tax cuts that we have now managed to get through the parliament. This, of course, is in addition to this government cutting the company tax from 36c to 30c, halving capital gains tax, introducing rollover relief, giving a 50 per cent disregard on the sale of a business and abolishing a whole host of indirect taxes - and additional indirect taxes could be abolished next week if the Labor states adhere to the agreement that we have come to them with on the GST. This is another piece in the jigsaw of giving small business opportunity in this country.While I am on my feet, let me also observe that the OECD has today placed on its web site a statement making clear that the document that was relied on last week - allegedly to show that there had been an increase in tax on wages in Australia - that included payroll tax from 2002 onwards was incorrect. The OECD will be redoing its figures and, as stated by the OECD in a statement from Paris overnight:The tax wedge for the average production worker in Australia ... declined ... between 1996 and 2003.No doubt the Labor Party will be apologising for the claims that it made, and no doubt news organisations that reported to the contrary will be correcting the record.</DOC>

 - We have a situation here where an allegation has been made, that allegation has been denied and that denial is contained in a signed statement which is now in the public domain and will be seriously, carefully and comprehensively examined. Sundry copies of it will no doubt be forwarded by various active people to various agencies. I have no doubt that, if there is anything untoward which has not been drawn to my attention or the attention of the government, that will surface.If an allegation made against a colleague of mine is publicly refuted through a statement personally signed by him, I am not going to be in the business of setting up some kind of independent inquiry in relation to that. In the absence of some further material casting doubt on what my colleague has said, I am not going to do that. I happen to take the view that my party is composed of honourable men and women. If those honourable men and women deny things, I do not intend to assume that those denials are untrue.Let me simply say again: an allegation has been carried in a number of very reputable and esteemed journals, the allegation has been denied - it was denied on radio this morning - the denial was amplified in the statement that I have tabled, the denial has been signed and it has been repeated in a discussion I have had with Senator Lightfoot and in a discussion he has had with the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I have no personal knowledge of these matters. I was not in Iraq. The first I knew about this was when I turned on the Channel 9 news this morning at six o'clock. I must say that I held my cup of tea at my lips as I saw the news - I did not immediately consume it. But when it settled down I thought, 'This is a going to be an interesting day!' I do not think I have been wrong about that. Knowing nothing myself about this matter -  
An opposition member - You were there! - I was simultaneously in Davos, Aceh and Iraq at the end of January! I am flattered by the capacities that the opposition imputes to me, of which in my 65 years I have hitherto been completely unaware. Let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: a claim has been made, it has been comprehensively denied and, in the absence of further material of substance coming to my attention, no, I do not intend to establish an independent inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and for his thoughts. There is no doubt that when I am in Japan next week - and I will be travelling there to advance our bilateral relationship - I will get a warm welcome from the Japanese, particularly in response to what Australia has done to contribute to a secure environment for Japanese forces in Iraq. I note that Prime Minister Koizumi said of the Australian decision: 'I welcome it. I highly appreciate the decision.' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosoda said he was 'very grateful and very much thanked Australia for its decision'. So, amongst other factors, there is no doubt that this is a very important development in Australia's relationship with Japan. It does something I have always wanted to do, and that is to build a stronger security relationship with Japan and develop it beyond just an economic relationship.There are other approaches. The honourable member for Blair asked if there were other policies. There is the policy of the Italian government on Iraq. The Italian parliament on Tuesday voted 246 to 180 to maintain 3,000 Italian troops in Iraq. They voted not to withdraw them - as some people are claiming - but to maintain them. I note that yesterday the foreign policy adviser to the Italian Prime Minister spoke to our ambassador and explained that, contrary to what the opposition in this country has been claiming, there has been no change in Italian policy. Prime Minister Berlusconi said publicly yesterday: 'Everything has to be agreed with allies. We will do everything in a concerted manner.' After President Bush spoke to Prime Minister Berlusconi yesterday, he said 'he wanted me to know that there was no change in his policy ... any withdrawals would be done in consultation with allies and ... depending upon the ability of Iraqis to defend themselves'. This is a point that I and the Prime Minister made yesterday.The opposition - when it comes to other policies we sometimes mention them - are hoping everybody will withdraw from Iraq. I said last week that the opposition had 17 different policies on Iraq. I think I am more of an expert on opposition policies on Iraq than the opposition are. I do not think they follow what they are saying. Last night we had a spectacular: the famous member for Griffith on Lateline. It is always worth watching. He announced not only the 17 policies but also the 18th and 19th. We had the member for Griffith talking about our deployment of 450 troops, and he was saying: 'The Italians are leaving' - as though the Italians were just going to walk out - 'and that is going to leave a less secure environment. What is going to happen to the Australians?' So Tony Jones forensically asked, 'So the Australians might have to be reinforced?' What does the member for Griffith say? He said, 'Well, you are right'. In other words, Labor will not rule out supporting the sending of more troops to reinforce the 450 - but they think we should withdraw from Iraq. I do not think I have ever seen in politics such a classic example of walking both sides of the street.The member for Griffith, having said this - so don't forget all that - was asked about the letter he sent to the Prime Minister that the Prime Minister referred to. He said in the letter that Australia had a 'solemn duty' to provide security for Iraq. Tony Jones asked him about it and the member for Griffith suddenly decided that policy No. 19 - our formal legal responsibilities in Iraq - concluded in June 2004. I do not know where he got that from, but suddenly there is a new policy. There is a new policy almost every hour from the Labor Party on Iraq.Let me give the Labor Party a policy. Follow the lead of Harry Barnes, the member for North-East Derbyshire, my parents-in-law own MP - not that they have ever voted for him, but they just might do so on 5 May, and I will be giving them a ring. Harry Barnes has set up Labour Friends of Iraq. Labour Friends of Iraq is about supporting democracy and freedom in Iraq. We hear none of that from the member for Griffith - you can forget him. We hear none of that from the Leader of the Opposition, who on this issue is trying to satisfy the sort of green Left of the Labor Party without wishing to tarnish his credentials with the Americans too much. There is an old saying in politics: walking both sides of the street does not work.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is asking me for a legal opinion. I think I will decline giving a legal opinion, and I thought it was in some way a breach of the standing orders to request it. Let me just repeat what I have said. I regard the response that Senator Lightfoot has given in the circumstances as a credible response to the allegations that have been made. For that reason I do not intend to commission some kind of independent inquiry. He has made a statement. It is for all the world now to see. It will be trawled over, no doubt, and if there are particular allegations or claims that the Leader of the Opposition wants to make let him make them, let him take action, let him pursue with the appropriate authorities what he regards as being the allegedly improper conduct of my colleague.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. Of course, his electorate being just near to the north of my electorate, he recognises the importance of exports for the strength of his local economy. The government is pursuing probably the most ambitious trade agenda of any Australian government in the history of this country. Along with putting enormous resources and energy into our pursuit of the multilateral agenda - that is, the successful conclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations - and not resting on our laurels and just putting all our eggs in that basket, we are also pursuing a range of bilateral opportunities with major trading partners.Earlier this year, on 1 January, the free trade agreement with the United States of America, the world's largest economy, entered into force. At the same time the free trade agreement with one of our major regional trading partners, Thailand, also entered into force. During the course of this year we will embark upon negotiations bilaterally with the 10 ASEAN countries to our near north, and today and tomorrow we will be meeting with our Indonesian colleagues here in Canberra and that will be part of the discussions with them.Earlier this week I announced we would be negotiating a free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates, in the Middle East. Later on this year hopefully - if we make a decision and our trading partners do too - we will launch negotiations for a possible negotiation with China and Malaysia. This is a very ambitious Australian agenda, and it is delivering for the Australian economy. As I indicated in debate yesterday, it delivered $152.5 billion worth of exports in 2004. That is set to grow, with 13 per cent growth in the first six months of 2004-05.Whilst the federal government is doing that, we are seeing state governments being lazy and resting on their laurels after collecting the booty from the sales of some of their assets that are creating choke points for some of these exports. Yesterday we heard of the outcome of the negotiations on the coal contracts. We have seen almost a doubling in the value of our coal exports prospectively, yet we still read in the papers that up to 50 ships are being held up waiting off the port of Dalrymple Bay in Queensland. I did a bit of research about when the Queensland government sold the long-term lease in Dalrymple Bay. Queensland's Premier Beattie said in his press release at the time:On the one hand we receive a strong return for the state from this asset; on the other hand we help ensure the long-term efficiency of the coal supply chain and the sustained competitiveness of the Central Queensland coal industry.Premier Beattie needs to revisit those words and think a bit more clearly about what his government should be doing to release this bottleneck at Dalrymple Bay for one of Australia's major exports - an export opportunity that could significantly boost the income to the economy of Australia out of the port of Dalrymple Bay. We learnt yesterday that the Queensland Competition Authority has been considering for 20 months the dispute between the users and the operators of the coal-loading terminal in the port of Dalrymple Bay. We have also learnt in the last couple of days that, not long after leaving the Queensland government, Mr David Hamill became the Chairman of Prime Infrastructure, the operator of the coal loader at Dalrymple Bay. I wonder if that has anything to do with the delay in the Queensland Competition Authority's decision in the dispute between the operators of the terminal and the users. The federal government is getting on with the job of providing opportunities for Australian exporters by helping to negotiate these deals and it is time that the Beattie government in Queensland in particular took some action to take care of what is fast becoming a national disgrace.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and her interest in ongoing reform in this area. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the long-term unemployment figures. They highlight the fact that long-term unemployment in Australia has fallen by 47 per cent since March 1996. The trend long-term unemployment level is now at its lowest level in Australia since 1986. Indeed, in the last month very long term unemployment - that is, those people unemployed for two years or more - has fallen by 9.7 per cent and this, too, is the lowest level since records were first kept in 1986. This is a result of the strong economy which has been administered by this government and of the workplace relations reforms which this government has put in place, which have helped to slash unemployment throughout Australia. However, the government acknowledges that further reform is necessary. Indeed, over the past few months almost every business organisation and industry group in Australia has called for further reform in this area. That is something on which we have heard absolute silence from the opposition.Last week the member for Perth told the Australian Mines and Metals Association:After the last election we announced that we would undertake a review of our industrial relations policy. That review is ongoing ...However, two days ago the Leader of the Opposition reportedly told ALP members of parliament that Labor would be 'a policy free zone'. One wonders whether that is why the Leader of the Opposition was re-elected. That was reported, but there was another report today in the Australian by Mike Steketee about a meeting that was held at the Star Hotel in North Fitzroy in Victoria. Such luminaries from the other side of the House as the member for Melbourne and the member for Fremantle are reported to have attended this meeting. One of the participants is reported to have told Mr Steketee: ... there are huge amounts of money available to fight election campaigns but very little to develop ideas.The reporter goes on to say:There also was a strong view that it was not good enough to leave policy-making to the next ALP national conference ... and to the shadow cabinet.This report indicates that many members on the other side of this chamber believe that the opposition is a policy free zone. The report indicates that there is a stark contrast between the parties. On one hand you have a party of policies and programs; on the other hand you have a party that is simply dedicated to petty in-fighting. On one hand you have a party of reform; on the other hand you have a party of reaction. We will continue to make policies and we will put them into practice for the wellbeing of the Australian people.</DOC>

I hazard a guess that the archaeological work would not have been carried out by Australia because the works are being carried out by the Turkish authorities.I know I do not need to remind anybody that we are dealing with the territory of another country. We made certain requests in relation to a road in one part of the area, which was, as I understand, a little away from Anzac Cove. They were made in the context of providing easier movement of people, given the large number of people who go to Anzac Cove not only on Anzac Day but throughout the year. If there is anything further I can make available, consistent with the obligation of which I have spoken, I will make that available.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I am sure lots of people want to ring him up to hear this good news. They want to hear this good news because, thanks to the policies of the Howard government, bulk-billing rates in rural and regional Australia have jumped from 52.8 per cent in the December quarter of 2003 to 64.9 per cent in the December quarter of 2004. A year ago, barely one in two GP services were bulk-billed in country Australia. Today, nearly two in three GP consultations are bulk-billed in country Australia.Bulk-billing is certainly not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, especially to children and concession card holders, and that is precisely what is happening thanks to the policies of the Howard government - in particular, the $7.50 regional bulk-billing incentive introduced as part of 'Strengthening Medicare'.I am sure the member for Braddon will be pleased to know that there has been a 14 per cent bulk-billing increase in his electorate. The member for Barker also has enjoyed a 13 per cent bulk-billing increase. Just so members know that the benefits of the Howard government are bestowed on a bipartisan basis, I can tell you that in Ballarat and in Capricornia the bulk-billing rate has gone up by 11 per cent - and I look forward to the press releases from those members giving credit where credit is due. All these results demonstrate that you can trust the Howard government with Medicare and that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I know, as a former and very distinguished member of the police force, he is very much aware that allegations of police corruption strike at the very heart of our society because they undermine the integrity of those services intended to serve and protect our community. The Australian government strongly supports measures to combat corruption in Australian police forces. These measures, of course, must be consistent with the existing legislative frameworks available as investigative tools. Corruption can only occur when proper oversight and accountability mechanisms are not in place.The telecommunications interception powers that we have are amongst the most intrusive investigatory tools available to law enforcement and anticorruption bodies. For that reason the Australian government expects Victoria to meet the same legislative requirements as every other jurisdiction. I have to say this is well understood by the Victorian government, but it is disappointing that it refuses to address the inherent conflict in the vesting of interception powers in the Director of the Office of Police Integrity who in his separate role as Ombudsman also has responsibility for oversighting the use of interception powers by the Victoria Police.I note that there is an editorial in the Herald Sun today that calls on me 'to act in the best interests of crime prevention'. I strongly agree with that sentiment, but I have to say the only authority standing in the way of conferral of interception powers to be used in the fight against corruption in Victoria is the Victorian government. I am willing to work with the Victorian government to assist it in complying with the interception regime that now exists, to ensure that Victoria is able to access exactly the same interception powers that have already been conferred on dedicated, independent anticorruption bodies operating in New South Wales and Western Australia. I notice the silence of the opposition on this matter. I hope it is a strong endorsement of the position the Commonwealth is taking on this question -  -  - and that you might encourage your Victorian colleagues to come to the party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite not only for his strong interest in the aerospace industry but for his ongoing support of industry, particularly high-tech industry in his electorate of Corangamite. - I checked your electorate yesterday, Gavan; it could do with some work. Australia's aerospace sector is generating jobs, exports and economic growth. The Australian government is standing right behind this industry and supporting it as it grows. Yesterday I announced a $12.5 million support package for the Australian aerospace manufacturer, Hawker de Havilland, a key player in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner project. This funding. which was complemented by the Victorian Labor government - I am unable to disclose how much, but can I assure the House that it was a pleasure working with a Labor government who had a vision to grow the economy - will cement Australia's role in developing the most advanced commercial aircraft ever built in the world.Hawker de Havilland has won the highly contested contract to develop the 787's trailing wing edges and, as a result of the government package, the bulk of this work will be done here in Australia. This is great news for the Australian economy, with the establishment of some 220 high-technology jobs and some 15 apprenticeships. As well as that, there will be hundreds of indirect jobs created by this project in terms of tooling, design and R&amp;D. In all, the project is expected to generate for Australia some $4 billion in revenue. This government support has ensured that Australian technology, Australian R&amp;D, is commercialised here in Australia for the benefit of Australia and for the benefit of creating jobs in Australia.I am asked if there are alternative proposals. The alternative proposal from the Labor Party would not have seen this project happen in Australia. Their policy of abolishing Invest Australia would have seen these jobs and this project go overseas and Hawker de Havilland miss out on the contract. While the Labor Party are happy to sit there and watch apprenticeships, jobs and economic wealth go overseas, this government is ensuring that jobs and economic growth are maintained.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In view of the question yesterday and my answer to it in Hansard, let me make a few points. This open competitive process is designed to ensure that more providers can offer new or better or different services in the community care programs, that existing providers can offer better ways of delivering community care programs and that older Australians who are receiving services under the community care programs have better access to services. In relation to the timing, existing providers have been on notice for some 18 months or more as existing contracts have not been renewed but rolled over, pending the outcome of the community care review. Last August the government produced its response to the community care review, 'The Way Forward'. I recall that at the time the member for Canberra supported the government's approach to the community care review. In fact, when the document was released there was support from the Australian Labor Party on the approach we were to take. Now when we do adopt that approach all the Labor Party does is criticise.A letter was sent to peak organisations and to providers advising of the open competitive process. Advertisements were placed in the paper. A procurement company was engaged to ensure independent probity and advice. The new contracts will be in place by 1 July. The department is working with all applicants and all providers to ensure that if transition arrangements are needed they will be put in place. Our priority is to ensure continuity of care for older Australians. This government has expended over $1.4 billion on community care programs. The service providers need to be accountable and older Australians deserve choice and better access to community care programs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and congratulate her on the fact that since she has been the member the unemployment rate in her electorate has dropped from 9.6 per cent to 6.6 per cent. It shows how hard she continues to work. I am very proud to inform the House today about a new voluntary pilot we have for parenting payment recipients. We know that it is very important process to go through because we know that in this country we have about 600,000 children who are living in families where nobody works. Two-thirds of those families are headed by only one person, so sole parent families comprise two-thirds of families where nobody works. It is a problem we need to continue to address.The pilot will cover seven regions across the country, including the Gold Coast. We are very proud of the fact that there will be many hundreds of recipients able to go into the Work for the Dole program who will benefit from what has been an incredibly successful program right across this country. It has been successful in providing work experience to people and in lifting their self-confidence and self-esteem. It ultimately provides for a stronger and more secure financial outcome not just for them but for their families as well. It shows that this government remains committed to the Work for the Dole program. It remains committed to providing young people and mature age people with work experiences that help them practically into paying jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I again express my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims of this tragic accident. I think I can safely presume to speak for all members of this House in this regard. I acknowledge the excellent efforts of the Queensland authorities, the police and emergency services personnel and the coroner and his team for their outstanding response to this tragedy in very difficult circumstances.As I said yesterday, I confirm that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have recovered both of the black boxes - the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. They are now due back in Canberra. Over the next few days, presuming that it is possible and if the contents of the boxes permit, they will be able to assemble a lot more information about what has happened. In the meantime, the ATSB will continue to map the site and gather available evidence. They have to complete that part of the investigation over the next few days.The Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA - as people would expect and as is the normal procedure in these cases - is cooperating fully and will make available all relevant material and all of their records, including their safety audits of the operators involved. If there are people with information that may be of use, we ask them to come forward - and that will of course be treated properly.I again emphasise the point that I made yesterday: uninformed speculation or public commentary in a case like this, ahead of our having clear advice and clear knowledge about what happened and why, is unfortunate and adds a burden to those already experiencing great grief. To the colleagues, friends and, most especially, though, the families of those who died, I again extend not only my sympathies but also the sympathy of all members of the House and, I am sure, the sympathy of all Australians.</DOC>

 - Let me simply say that I had not thought it was in my ministerial responsibilities to comment upon the remarks made by leaders of other political parties. Let me say this about my good friend Michael Howard. I had the opportunity after the British election to congratulate the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a man who displayed spectacular courage on Iraq, a man who was prepared to lead and, where necessary, confront his own party on that subject. I had the opportunity to speak to him and I also had the opportunity, as is my fraternal wont, to speak to the leader of the British Conservative Party, who expressed to me - and I am glad you asked me this question - great admiration for the support he had received from my good friend Lynton Crosby. -  - You know all about Lynton Crosby, don't you! All I can say is that different people have different views on all sorts of subjects. I wish Mr Blair well on his re-election. I wish the British Conservative Party good health. I am glad they won some seats from the Labour Party. It will be a very interesting contest at the next election.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know how interested he is in security issues, given his former career in the Australian Defence Force - and a distinguished career as well. Back in 2002 I pushed the idea with the Japanese and also the US Deputy Secretary of State, Rich Armitage, whom many here know, that we should establish a trilateral security dialogue between Australia, the United States and Japan. This eventuated at what is sometimes called deputies level. When I was in New York and in Washington last week, I met with Foreign Minister Machimura of Japan and also with the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. We all agreed that we should upgrade this dialogue to ministerial level. This dialogue is likely to occur twice a year at ministerial level. It will also have an officials level component, which will meet out of session.I have been promoting this idea because Australia and Japan have a lot in common. Everybody is familiar with the trading relationship, but we have security interests in common as well. Both of our countries are great liberal democracies, both of our countries are developed economies - we are aid donors in the region - and both of our countries are allies of the United States of America. Bearing in mind all of those things, for us to get together from time to time and talk not only about regional issues but also about global issues makes a great deal of sense. Bear in mind, for example, that Australia and Japan are literally side by side in Iraq, and the United States, obviously, is substantially present in Iraq as well. That is an illustration of how we as countries can work together. Because we are countries that stand for similar values and we are close partners in the Asia-Pacific region, we do not want that partnership to be a limited one; we want to encourage and develop it. So I was delighted that Secretary of State Rice, Foreign Minister Machimura and I were all able to agree last week to upgrade that trilateral security dialogue to ministerial level.</DOC>

 - I reject the suggestion that we are arrogant or insensitive on these matters. - Yes, I did see Lateline, and I thought the minister performed magnificently. I thought the minister displayed a steadiness under legitimate but tough questioning. That was admirable. I watched the whole lot of it. I thought Amanda did a very good job in a difficult situation. Quite plainly, the public expects answers in relation to both Cornelia Rau and the apparently mistaken deportation, and we will respond to that; but we are going to allow the Palmer inquiry to run its course. In the light of what the Palmer inquiry reveals, further decisions and responses will be developed. Mick Palmer is a person of ability. This is an issue that requires somebody who has an on-the-ground understanding of how police and other procedures work. I think Mick Palmer is very well qualified for that. When we have the results of that inquiry, we will calmly have a look at them and only then decide what further action may be needed. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and all members of the House that we do not take these matters lightly and that we do not dismiss them arrogantly, insensitively or contemptuously.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and recognise his interest in this particular bilateral relationship, given that his electorate provides a lot of the exports that go to China, particularly the iron ore that goes out of Western Australia to China and, prospectively, the LNG resources that are going to earn significant amounts for Australia's economy in years to come.On 19 April, during his fifth visit to China as Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and his Chinese counterpart, Premier Wen Jiabao, announced that Australia and China will commence negotiations on an FTA. Obviously, the FTA will further enhance Australia's outstanding trading relationship with China, a trading relationship that now stands at a value of about $27 billion in two-way trade. That figure has trebled over the last five years. China is now Australia's second-largest merchandise export market. Merchandise exports grew by 22 per cent in the last year.A joint feasibility study concluded that an FTA could boost the Australian economy by an estimated $24.4 billion. The announcement was welcomed by business groups, both core business manufacturing industries and agricultural industries alike. The National Farmers Federation has endorsed the government's decision to go ahead with the FTA, saying that farmers and agricultural exporters would gain significantly. The Australia China Business Council said that it is a sign of significant progress in a burgeoning trade relationship. As with the free trade agreements we have negotiated with Singapore and Thailand, and negotiations that are under way with the ASEAN group of countries and Malaysia, it is a part of this government's ambitious trade agenda with Asia - a trade agenda that is absolutely focused on expanding our export opportunities and generating new jobs in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I am not familiar with that particular survey. I can inform the mining community in Newcastle and the Hunter that, had there been a Labor government elected last year, there would have been a $470 million tax on the mining industry through the reduction in the diesel fuel rebate from 100 per cent to 90 per cent to fund more places for doctors and lawyers in Australian universities. Tell the mining companies that!As far as the University of Newcastle is concerned, I will not repeat what I said in the House in response to a previous question on this matter. But the Labor Party needs to be reminded that the problems at Newcastle university relate specifically to the management of the university. The vice-chancellor himself, Professor Nick Saunders, said in the Australian Financial Review on 4 May this year that the university's problem is its:... 'very old fashioned ways of doing business' which led to it being burdened by higher staff costs than most other institutions.In its editorial on this matter the Australian said it extremely well on the same day:Whatever the cause of the crisis, Newcastle faces a problem of its own management's making. And the Government cannot, must not, come to its rescue.I ask the member for Newcastle to explain to people in the Hunter why she and everybody on the other side voted against more than $50 million of additional money for Newcastle university in the reforms to Australian higher education.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. It is an opportunity to remind all members that this government is unmistakeably and unambiguously tough on drugs. Since 1997 the government has spent more than $1 billion on law enforcement, on education and on rehabilitation because there is no safe way to use illicit drugs. People said then, and they have said subsequently, that you can never win the war against drugs. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently published statistics showing that in 2004 15 per cent of the Australian population at some stage used illicit drugs. This is far too high, but it is a very big improvement indeed from the 22 per cent of the population who had used illicit drugs back in 1998. Heroin deaths are down from well over 1,100 in 1999 to about 350 now. The number of heroin users has come down by 12,000 since 2001.This government is tough on drugs. I have to say that there is a strange ambivalence from members opposite. In 1999 the Leader of the Opposition strongly supported heroin injecting rooms. I suggest to members opposite that, if they want to demonstrate that they are different now, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to say he has changed and got stronger, here is an opportunity: oppose heroin injecting rooms and support a zero tolerance policy for illicit drugs.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the web site to which the member refers but on the question of the road, as the member knows, the changes that were requested by the Australian government in the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs' letter did not relate to the Anzac Cove road. It is true that some changes were made to that road as a result of the common position of Australian and Turkish authorities that, for safety and conveyance reasons, some reinforcement and change was needed, but the scale and scope of those were not specifically or, indeed, implicitly requested by the Australian government.Let me also say this: we have had excellent cooperation from the Turkish authorities. I had the privilege, as did a number of other members of this House, to visit Anzac Cove on Anzac Day and I also had the privilege to meet in person probably about 1,000 young people who were there. I will say two things about it. The first thing I will say is that not one single person of the at least 1,000 people - largely young but of many ages - that I met said anything about the roadworks: not one single person. -  - The honourable member has asked this question. He has tried to make a bit of mileage out of it. He is entitled to do that but I am entitled to put the facts as I encountered them there. I had the opportunity to meet these people, and not one single person made any reference to the road. I suspect that that was also the experience of others in this House who visited.Could I also take this opportunity to say that, as a result of discussions that I had with the Turkish Prime Minister on 26 April, there has been an agreement for a joint engineering review, and the review will be conducted as a matter of priority. The team from Australia that is contributing to that review will be leaving this weekend, and the Turkish government has agreed that no further roadworks will take place until those discussions are held.The other point that I will make to those who sit opposite is simply this: sacred though this site is to this country - and it plainly is - we must remember that it is Turkish territory. We must respect the sovereignty of Turkey and we must also acknowledge the contribution that the Turks have made to the joint commemoration of events that occurred on this particular site. I say to the member for Grayndler and to some - not all - on the other side who have sought to make some political mileage out of this that, if they had been there, they would have been sadly disappointed by the response of average Australians to their miserable campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I was delighted to join him to visit some small businesses in his electorate last year. Just recently Michael Chaney from the Business Council of Australia released research commissioned by the Business Council which revealed the benefits of changes that have been made to the workplace relations system under this government. In particular, that research estimated that the benefits of change were equivalent to $4,200 in additional income per person per year in 2004 and the equivalent of over $80,000 in wealth per person.Indeed, this research indicated that, had it not been for the changes to industrial relations brought about in the last nine years in Australia, the unemployment rate in 2004 would have been 8.1 per cent rather than 5.8 per cent at that time. So what this clearly shows, once again, is the strong link between workplace relations reform and higher productivity. That is why the Business Council of Australia, along with almost every other business group in this country, is urging the government to make further reforms to the workplace relations system.The member for Kingston asked me whether there were any alternative views. Indeed, there is a range of alternative views. I was interested to see on Sunday on Meet the Press that the member for Lilley said:There will always be more to be done in industrial relations ...This did not quite ring a bell with what I had heard from the Leader of the Opposition, who on 12 April told the National Press Club:The industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry ...Is there more to be done or has it been squeezed dry? Then we had the member for Perth, who last month told a union meeting:_ I am in the market place for sensible industrial relations reform that is based on fairness and productivity _He went on to say:I am happy to contemplate serious industrial relations reforms that improve the productivity and efficiency of the economy _So there is yet another alternative view from the opposition. More recently we had the Leader of the Opposition telling the Australian Sustaining Prosperity Conference:The scope for productivity gains from the old reform agenda of deregulation, privatisation and industrial relations reform is largely exhausted.So the lemon has been squeezed dry - according to the Leader of the Opposition, it is largely exhausted - yet we have these alternative views from the member for Lilley and the member for Perth. We must ask the question: just what does the opposition believe? The Leader of the Opposition is reported in the Australian this morning as saying that his strategy is to pursue a 'two parallel tracks' approach. I am not quite sure what 'two parallel tracks' is. All I can work out is that this is the railway equivalent of walking both sides of the street.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member would be aware, the Middle East is a very important market for Australian agricultural produce, not just for live animals, about which there has been a lot of public attention, but also for meat, grain - in particular, wheat and barley - dairy products, fruit and vegetables and a whole range of other agricultural produce worth at least $600 million a year. During a recent visit to the Middle East region, I was able to sign, on behalf of the government, some agricultural cooperation agreements with Kuwait, Jordan, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia - and that follows on from an earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates. These agreements will provide for agricultural cooperation between our countries. They will provide opportunities for Australia to share ideas in areas such as dryland agriculture, locust control and the like. In the case of Eritrea, we are providing some assistance for the development of an agricultural college in that country.The signing of the agreement with Saudi Arabia is of particular significance because it will open up the capacity for us to lift the ban on the live animal export trade with that country. Saudi Arabia has established a quarantine facility which will be available to immediately unload any live animals should there be a dispute that would lead to a delay in the unloading of the shipment. Countries such as Kuwait, Jordan and Eritrea have also given similar undertakings that, in the event of there being a dispute, the animals would be unloaded into a safe place while those dispute issues are resolved. I think that is an important breakthrough. In the case of Eritrea, there has also been an undertaking to accept animals from other countries in the event of Australia asking them to do so as a result of a dispute in that region.Animals will be unloaded within 36 hours. That will provide the confidence that the Australian people expect that this trade will deliver good animal welfare outcomes and will be conducted in an atmosphere of assurance that the trade is acceptable internationally. From an Australian perspective, we will be doing more in relation to the choice, selection and preparation of animals for the trade, and, at the other end, as a result of these agreements there is now a firm commitment to unload the animals promptly and deal with them in accordance with proper animal welfare principles. This is an important market for Australia, and these agreements will ensure there is a strong level of agricultural cooperation between Australia and the Middle East.</DOC>

 - It is pretty hard for members opposite to say that there was some kind of conspiracy of deceit on the part of the government when the figures the member for Fraser referred to were published by this government before the election. There was no conspiracy; there was no attempt to deceive. Members opposite are trying to say that there has been some kind of travesty perpetrated on the Australian people by this government in respect of the safety net. I want to make three points. The first point is that when I made my pre-election statements about the safety net I made them in good faith. I absolutely believed them to be true. The second point is that the highest commitment of any government is to the long-term national interest of the country. This government reluctantly made a decision that it was necessary to restore the originally proposed safety net thresholds for the sustainability of our great Medicare system.The final point I make is that this is not a question of members opposite supporting a low safety net threshold and members here supporting a high safety net threshold. They do not support a safety net at all. They would rip the safety net right off the Australian people. All this huffing and puffing, all this posturing from the member for Lalor and others -  - The member for Lalor is waxing indignant about this change to the safety net threshold. It is like Al Capone complaining that there are fewer policemen on the streets of Chicago! It is rank hypocrisy and it is totally unconvincing to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Perhaps I could best answer that question by quoting the current Leader of the Australian Labor Party and what many people believe will be a future leader of the Australian Labor Party. The current leader of the Australian Labor Party - the person who asked me the question - said that many tradespeople were affected by the top tax rates cutting in too soon. He said this in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 February 2005. The headline was: 'Beazley's ALP to champion the new rich'.It gets even better, because if you do not want to rely on the authority of the current leader of the Australian Labor Party let me quote the words of Bill Shorten, the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, who is apparently lining up some of his factional opponents in Victorian seats to be shoehorned into this place at the next election. This is what Bill Shorten had to say in an article in the Australian on 3 May this year:Some steelworkers I know at a OneSteel fabrication plant are doing something about Australia's rotten tax system. Having calculated how much they can earn before paying the top income tax rate of 47c in the dollar, they simply refuse to work any overtime that pushes them above the limit.He went on to say:The top marginal income tax rate thresholds - that is, I say to the Leader of the Opposition, the 47c and 42c thresholds - should be raised to create a fair, productive and competitive tax system.I could not put it better. But that is only the half of it. The whole basis of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition on the tax cuts announced in the budget last night is his charge that in some way we have made the tax and payment system of this country unfair to low- and middle-income earners. The Leader of the Opposition is posing now as the champion of the low- and middle-income earners of Australia.Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition about what has happened to low- and middle-income earners under this government. Let me remind him that since coming to office the government has increased total assistance to families by over $6 billion and that the base rate of family assistance has increased from less than $600 a child in January 1996 to almost $1,700 a child - a real increase of over 100 per cent. Let me remind him that even before last night's budget a single income family on $41,800 a year would pay no net tax. They would pay no net tax on $41,800 a year.If he does not want to take my word for it, let me remind him of the modelling carried out by Anne Harding at NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, that shows that low-income households have enjoyed the strongest growth in private incomes over the period from 1997 to 2004. This research shows that the real disposable income of low-income families grew by an average of $87 a week - a rate of growth similar to that of middle-income families. She concluded that, overall, the bottom 60 per cent of households are net gainers from the welfare and taxation policies of this government. In the face of that record, in the face of his own statement and in the face of the logic argued by a putative leader of the Australian Labor Party, the reaction of the Leader of the Opposition and his attack, on the basis of fairness, on this budget is absolutely staggering. But the Leader of the Opposition is characterised by a capacity to change his position according to the prevailing mood.I have another piece of field evidence, because as well as opposing the taxation cuts the Leader of the Opposition has also declared that the Labor Party will vote against the removal of the superannuation surcharge. That is a pretty remarkable statement, because do you know what he did when he was last leader? He voted against its introduction. That is an astonishing performance. How is this for consistency and new era leadership from the member for Brand? You vote against the introduction, you vote against any amelioration of it and you vote against its abolition! That is a trifecta of humbug the like of which I have not seen. I rest my case.</DOC>

 - That question is a reminder of the paucity of the leadership that the member for Brand is bringing to the Australian Labor Party at the present time. The members of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, like all other law-abiding Australians, pay tax. They will be taxed in exactly the same way as anybody else is taxed at an equivalent level of income. I simply remind the Leader of the Opposition how inconsistent his position has become. It was all right when he was freshly returned to the leadership, running around trying to demonstrate that it was a new Beazley in charge of the Australian Labor Party, when he said:Ordinary tradespeople were affected by the top tax rate cutting in too soon, which could even be a cause of the shortage of skilled tradespeople.In other words, he was arguing commonsense, just as Bill Shorten was arguing commonsense. We need a tax and payments system that looks after the vulnerable. We also need a tax and payments system that encourages and provides incentive to people in the community to work harder and to better themselves. We also need a taxation system that is internationally competitive. We need a taxation system that will retain the brightest and the best in this country and not see them increasingly go out of this country to other countries. We also need a taxation system that recognises the essential classlessness of this country and we need a taxation system which is not built on the old-fashioned, outdated, discredited politics of envy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I note that he, of course, represents the port of Gladstone. That is a major export port. Some 12 per cent of Australia's exports go through that port and about a third of Queensland's, and we are helping to develop it. That is very important for investment and for jobs. The budget indeed confirms that Queensland, provided only that it signs up to the bilateral for AusLink, will do extraordinarily well, with some $415 million for projects in Gympie, Gladstone, Townsville and Tully. The flood proofing of the highway south of Tully is something that is urgently needed, and that will take place just as soon as Queensland signs up.I begin by congratulating the Treasurer for looking to the future. The government has looked to the future. This is, in essence, a budget for our children and grandchildren because it looks to the realities of an ageing population and the fact that we need to do the right thing by those who will be future taxpayers. When it comes to measures in the budget of value to regional Australia, the first point I would make is that for the great export industries of agriculture, mining and tourism you need a soundly run economy. And that is what this budget locks in: low inflation, interest rates down, a competitive economy and the winding back of debt. It lets us fund infrastructure.The Treasurer spoke again of AusLink last night. One powerful illustration of what AusLink is achieving is to be found in the Hunter Valley where, until we took over the Hunter Valley line, capacity constraints on the rail network meant that we could not pump the amount of coal through Port Waratah that the port could undertake. The reforms that we have put in place have already resulted in a 20 per cent improvement in productivity since we took it over in September last year, and we are en route from 85 million tonnes a year to 140 million tonnes capacity over the next five years. - I will take that interjection about the New England Highway. We are going to build a link road between the F3 and the New England Highway. I know the member for Paterson is very excited about that. Then there is the $2 billion water fund and the money to ensure that we are able to enact and carry forward the most significant environmental policy achievement in this country for the last couple of decades - the National Water Initiative.Over and beyond that there are a couple of specifics I would like to mention. We have a real problem with a shortage of doctors and allied health care workers in regional Australia. The budget introduces a $15 million program to help small rural communities build medical centres and clinics to attract doctors on the new basis that many of them work on - they essentially choose not to buy into partnerships in the way that they used to. There is $5.6 million to help subsidise the costs of en route charges for light aviation to keep those vitally important rural commuting plane services in place.It would be remiss of me not to mention the drought. I think all of us, I hope on a bipartisan basis, would be very concerned about the outlook at the moment. The critical timing for sowing this year is slipping away from us. An estimated $1 billion has been made available and is going out at the rate of some $4 million a week to help farmers in rural communities cope with drought. This budget puts down proper foundations for the future and - in stark contrast to the ALP, which says, 'Whenever you spend money in the regions, you're doing the wrong thing' - confirms our commitment to regional Australia, and extends and improves it.</DOC>

 - Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition of some of the basic arithmetic of this budget. When all of the tax changes announced by the Treasurer last night are implemented, the Leader of the Opposition has promised that he will block them - all of them. Not only will he block the tax cuts that involve a lift in the threshold; he said this morning that he is going to ask his party in the Senate to vote against cutting tax from 17 per cent to 15 per cent.The Leader of the Opposition is up here on his third question posing as some kind of pretend friend of the battlers of this country. He is actually saying to the battlers of Australia: 'As far as I'm concerned, you can't even have $6 a week.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. Let us have none of this phoney indignation from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is going to vote them down. He knows perfectly well that all of these tax measures will be rolled into one piece of legislation and, in order for the workers of Australia to enjoy by 1 July this year a reduction from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, the Australian Labor Party will have to support our measures in the Senate because the minor parties have said they will not support them.So it is in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition between now and when the Senate reconvenes after 1 July. Is he going to vote for or against the $6 a week tax cut that he derides? Is he going to vote for or against a reduction in the bottom rate of tax? Is he going to vote for or against some tax relief to the low- and middle-income earners of Australia? It appears from what he said on radio this morning that he is going to vote against those measures, but he does have time to recant by Thursday night. Maybe pressure from some of the people who sit behind him, who I think have a little more realism in their bodies about this issue, might bring about a change in relation to the Leader of the Opposition.In relation to the arithmetic of the tax cuts, let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that as a result of the changes the Treasurer announced last night more than 80 per cent of Australians will be on a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. Only three per cent of Australian wage and salary earners, income earners and taxpayers will be on a top marginal rate of 47c in the dollar.I regard that as a reform for all Australians. I regard changes to the tax system that provide greater incentive for steelworkers, greater incentive for people who work in the mining industry, greater incentive for many police officers who work overtime, greater incentive for people who work in the Public Service and greater incentive for many small business men and women who work from home as being good for the future of this country. And so, in his saner moments, did the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition once believed this. He believed it a long time ago. He believed it on 3 February 2005. Way back in February this year that is what the Leader of the Opposition believed and it is still what Bill Shorten, a future leader of the Australian Labor Party, believes. Not only did he lament the fact that many steelworkers he represented were going to get into this top bracket and lose their incentive to work overtime; he also made the telling point that not only did he regard the rate as too high but also as coming in at too low a level compared with the United States at $402,000, Britain at $73,000 and Japan at $216,000, using Australian dollar exchange rates at 16 March. In opposing these measures and engaging in the cheap populism that has characterised the last three questions, the Leader of the Opposition is abandoning any credibility in relation to his own position.</DOC>

Last night not only did the government balance the budget and make a substantial investment in services but also returned to taxpayers a reduced tax bill in the form of income tax cuts for every Australian. Those tax cuts take two forms. One is a cut to the rates at the lower level and the other is an increase in the thresholds at the upper level. The consequence of those tax cuts is that all Australians get a tax cut but low-income earners get the largest percentage tax cut. A person on $10,000 would get a tax cut of above 15 per cent whereas a person on $100,000 would get a tax cut of under 10 per cent. Those new rates will give incentive to the Australian public in terms of work and effort.Having established in this place that the government stands for lower taxes, the Leader of the Opposition has been busily establishing that Labor stands for higher taxes. On the AM program this morning the AM reporter asked the Leader of the Opposition whether Labor will vote for the change from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar for very low income earners. 'What will Labor do?' she asked. 'What will Labor do on reducing the 17c rate to 15c?' she asked the Leader of the Opposition. Get a load of this answer: 'We are going to vote against it.' They are going to vote against a reduction of the lowest tax rate from 17c to 15c. The AM reporter, incredulous, said, 'You are happy to be seen to vote against the tax cut from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar?' The answer: 'No, it is part of a package which delivers an unfair outcome so of course we will not vote for it.' If you ever wanted proof that Labor stands for higher taxes, there it is.This bill will be introduced tomorrow. I believe we can facilitate a vote on it this week - we could do it tomorrow if need be. I would like an indication from the members of the Labor Party backbench before we call the vote that there will be no sudden illnesses that call them back to their electorates, no pairing and no overseas trips, because every one of the Labor Party backbench ought to go onto the record as voting against a reduction in the lowest income tax rate from 17c to 15c. A sudden hush comes over the Labor Party backbench at this point of the proceedings. If we can get the Labor Party whip to guarantee no illness and no unexplained commitments back in the electorates, then we can bring the vote on and give every single one of them the chance to vote against a reduction in the lowest income tax rate from 17c to 15c.The kind of questioning that you have heard from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to these tax changes reminds me of his last outing on economic policy. His last outing on economic policy for those of us who were in the House was when the government was introducing the GST and abolishing the wholesale sales tax. He campaigned on that for over three years on envy politics - that it would destroy Australia as we knew it, that it would be terrible for poor, that the sky would fall in, that either interest rates would go up or interest rates would go down, that the economy would either overheat or undercool. He promised us the policy which dare not speak its name. His last economic outing was on the policy of rollback.We do not hear too much about the policy of rollback because nobody in their right mind today would say that we ought to get rid of GST and go back to wholesale sales tax. Do you know what is happening here? This government has to fight for the hard yards. We have to put up with this cheap opportunism. No sooner have our reforms been put in place than the Leader of the Opposition wants to adopt them and make them his own. Let me make this prediction: if these income tax changes go through, the Leader of the Opposition will not be going to the next election demanding that they be reversed. He will not be going to the next election saying that the 15c tax rate ought to go up to 17c. He will not be going to the next election saying that the top threshold ought to come back down from $125,000 to $70,000. The truth is that he is not opposed to this reform. He is a cheap populist who wants to try and play envy politics, which has no place in Australian society.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for that question. Can I remind him that in this country we operate under a progressive taxation system. We have in the past examined - I certainly did back in the 1980s - the introduction of a flat taxation system. It would work manifestly against the interests of very low income people because their average tax rates would be far below the level at which any flat tax would be introduced. In those circumstances it is inevitable that two consequences follow. It is inevitable that people on higher incomes pay a lot more in tax, in dollar sums. It is also inevitable that whenever there is an adjustment to the tax rates or to the threshold the dollar gain by higher income earners is greater than by those on lower incomes because they start off by paying a lot more. That is just a simple fact of how the taxation system operates. The member for Lilley knows that. The Leader of the Opposition knows that.The argument that is being mounted by both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley is just about the most intellectually dishonest argument I have heard in this place for a long time. But it is hardly surprising, because the Labor Party is led by a person who promised so much to his own colleagues when he returned to the leadership but who, on every occasion he has had over the last three or four months to embrace genuine reform and change in the economic area, has fallen at the hurdle. He made that extraordinary declaration at the Sustaining Prosperity Conference in Melbourne that the cause of industrial relations reform has been accomplished and nothing more needs to be done. He said later on that the lemon had been squeezed dry when it came to industrial relations reform. By his opportunistic rejection of last night's taxation reforms, he demonstrates very clearly something that I told my party room yesterday, and that is that he is the first political leader in modern history to have acquired reform fatigue while still in opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Last night's budget introduces a comprehensive reform of Australia's welfare system for Australians of working age. It does so by tackling the twin goals of lifting work force participation and reducing welfare dependency whilst at the same time maintaining a strong safety net for those who need it. A feature of the reforms is to introduce new obligations for those who have the capacity to do some work. Parents on welfare will generally be required to look for part-time work when their youngest child is aged between six and 15. People with disabilities who apply for welfare and can work part time will be required to seek part-time work. I stress that, when these changes are made, people who are currently on the parenting payment and the disability support pension will remain on those payments.These measures involve expenditure by this government of some $3.6 billion over the forward estimates period. For example, the government will spend over $2 billion on expanding services to assist people to get back into the work force, including some $681 million for the Job Network, to help people prepare for and find work, and $266 million for child care, to fund an additional 84,300 extra outside school hours care places. I note in passing that there are more extra outside school hours care places being funded in this budget than existed in total under the Labor Party when it was last in government. In addition to that, there are 2½ thousand extra family day care places, and child-care fee assistance for an extra 52,000 families.In welcoming this budget the CEO of Mission Australia, Mr Patrick McClure, who has had a great interest in welfare reform in this country, said that the federal government's welfare reform package will encourage people to return to work. He said:This is a broad package of incentives which will advance the cause of welfare reform.The reality is that this government wants to see more Australians in jobs - and, by the way, when they get a job, we think they deserve a tax cut too.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. One of the important parts of the budget has been the government's decision to provide funding over four years for the establishment of a capacity to provide warnings of possible tsunamis, to establish a national tsunami warning centre. This is a very important initiative. Everybody in this parliament and around Australia was very struck by the impact of the tsunami back on Boxing Day last year. We understand the horrific impact of tsunamis. We also understand that even our own country could conceivably be affected.The $68.9 million we are spending on a tsunami warning centre will be split into three. Some $36.4 million will be for the development of a warning capability for the west coast of Australia, covering the Indian Ocean immediately to the west and north-west of Australia; $21.8 million will be for the establishment of a warning system for the east coast of Australia; and $10.7 million will be for an Australian contribution, integrated with the existing Pacific tsunami warning system, which will facilitate tsunami warnings in the south-west Pacific. As I think all members know, we take our responsibility in the Pacific very seriously. To provide additional support to ensure that those small and often vulnerable countries in the south-west Pacific are not excessively damaged by a tsunami is an important initiative by Australia.We are taking a lead role in responding to the tragedy of the Indian Ocean tsunami. We have taken a leading role in terms of assistance; we have taken a leading role in terms of aid; we are now taking a leading role in terms of establishing a tsunami warning centre. That is just one of the many extraordinarily valuable contributions, both domestically and internationally, that the Treasurer brought forth in the budget last night.</DOC>

 - No, I do not. I do not agree with either of those gentlemen. I sometimes do and I sometimes do not. Let me tell you why I do not agree with them. The first reason is that the surplus is one per cent of GDP, which is a very significant surplus, and the surpluses in the out-years are almost equivalent to that. The other reason is that, importantly, because we have decided that the income from the Future Fund will be reinvested into the corpus of the fund, we have effectively tightened fiscal policy. We are not taking the income of the fund at the bottom line of the budget; we are reinvesting it in the fund. That represents a tightening of fiscal policy. On both of those grounds, I do not agree with either Saul Eslake or Chris Caton.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. It is appropriate to remind the House that in last night's budget there were 98 individual health measures involving a net new spend of $3.3 billion - $3.3 billion on health. I am more than capable of proudly saying that the Howard government is still the best friend that Medicare has ever had. It is an even better friend with an extra $3.3 billion that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have contributed to health over the forward estimates period.Let me focus for a moment on the very serious issue of cancer. As the Treasurer pointed out last night, cancer is the principal underlying cause of death in this country. One in three men and one in four women will face the reality of cancer in their lives before the age of 75. The good news is that death rates from cancer have been dropping by 1½ per cent a year over the last decade. Last night, this government committed an additional $190 million for cancer detection, cancer care and cancer research.Let me highlight a few measures. We committed $43 million to implement our election commitment to phase in a national bowel cancer screening program by 2008. We committed $23 million to implement our election commitment to provide local palliative care grants. Another election commitment was implemented last night: $14 million to establish a new coordinating agency, Cancer Australia. And a very important new initiative was $25 million to try to reduce smoking amongst young people.I refer all members to the comment of the Cancer Council of Australia that this budget is 'the most comprehensive set of government-funded cancer control priorities ever announced in a Federal budget'. I thank the Treasurer and I thank the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and also for his very strong and ongoing interest in industry in his electorate, which I have had the opportunity to visit from time to time. We on this side of the House focus on economic responsibility so, when we have the opportunity, we can give back to the Australian people. Last night this government cut taxes to individuals and to business. One of the many winners in last night's budget was industry. The three per cent Tariff Concession Scheme was taken away at midnight last night. Industry is immediately better off by $1.3 billion over the next five years. This is a major boost to manufacturing. It will save the makers of electrical goods some $37 million and the makers of textiles some $6 million. Where there is no locally produced equivalent, imported parts on a whole range of items will be three per cent cheaper. Those items range from furniture through to construction equipment and even lawnmowers.It is worth reflecting on the views of some of the industry organisations. The Tyre Manufacturers Association has hailed the move as 'much needed tariff relief for Australia's tyre manufacturers', and it will assist in 'safeguarding local manufacturers'. The Australian Industry Group said:... the government has got down to business in this budget. The removal of the three per cent tax on manufacturing imports will be greatly welcomed.They said:All round, a smart effort.I could not have said it better myself. This government has a history of cutting taxes whenever the economic conditions allow it to do that. But, on the other side of this House, the Labor Party are opposed to tax cuts. They are opposed to tax cuts for individuals and they are opposed to tax cuts for industry. That is a disgrace. They are a disgraceful, opportunistic opposition. This government will continue to pursue tax cuts for individual Australians and for industry.</DOC>

 - I am a regular reader of both of those gentlemen. I read both their articles. I think the budget is both popular and responsible. I think the irresponsibility and the populism is in the Labor Party's response rather than in the content of the budget. I read the entirety of Alan Woods's article, and I do not think the quote employed by the member for Lilley does justice to the balance of his article. In particular, he expressed the very strong view that I did a couple of questions ago: that the budget would not exert upward pressure on interest rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question because, coming from Western Australia, as he does, and given Western Australia's proximity to areas of instability, he appreciates very much the importance of the security of Australia. Yesterday, at an important conference on security and government, the Deputy Director of ASIO said:There had been at least one actual or disrupted terrorist attack against Australian interests in each year of the past five years.He cited Bali, the Marriott Hotel incident, the embassy attack in Indonesia, the thwarted terror plot of Frenchman Willie Brigitte and the thwarted plot to attack the Australian High Commission in Singapore. The environment in which we operate necessitates not only the swift, decisive and comprehensive response that the government pursued after September 11 - where we have now invested somewhere in the order of $5.6 billion in measures to protect Australia and Australians from the threat of terrorism - but also that this work be regarded by us as an unfinished canvas. That is why in the budget we have included a raft of additional measures totalling more than $1 billion in additional expenditure. That included an extra $150 million for ASIO to boost training and cooperation in the region, to further develop language skills, to improve border control monitoring and to enhance counter-terrorism investigation capability. There is $48 million for agencies within my portfolio, so as to ensure that we can effectively manage the security arrangements when we host APEC. Victorians will be interested in our involvement in the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne through the Protective Security Coordination Centre.There is a further $694 million to boost the capacity of the Australian Federal Police, particularly here in Australia and throughout the region. The Australian Federal Police will continue its excellent cooperation work with more than half a million dollars allocated to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, and regional cooperation will be enhanced with the further commitment of $7.6 million over two years to strengthen the AFP's capacity to be able to detect and deter the movement of terrorists throughout the region. These measures, and many others outlined in the budget, demonstrate clearly the government's determination to build on our security arrangements and to maintain the safest environment possible for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. This budget provides a major boost to Australia's border security and quarantine arrangements - in fact, close to $1 billion of extra funding is being provided for our quarantine service and for the Customs Service to undertake their very important activities in keeping this country free of pests and diseases and in curbing illegal fishing activities. This funding is in addition to the base funding that is provided to those organisations to run their day-to-day activities. There is around $560 million over the next four years to maintain the increased quarantine intervention that has been occurring since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom. This will mean that we will continue to be able to inspect all the mail that comes into Australia, all the containers that come into this country and around 90 per cent of the passengers who arrive at our airports.In addition, there is close to $40 million to establish Biosecurity Australia as an independent agency, as we indicated during the election campaign that we would do; and over $300 million to undertake increased activities to endeavour to stamp out illegal foreign fishing in northern and southern waters. These are particularly important initiatives because of our concerns not only about quarantine issues associated with the illegal foreign fishing effort but about our capacity to manage those scarce stocks and to ensure that fishing occurs in a sustainable way.In addition, I am sure the honourable member will be particularly pleased to note that there is $144 million in the budget to maintain the 40 per cent subsidy on export inspection charges for our primary products. That will certainly help to encourage our exports into those difficult markets around the world.This contrasts markedly with the situation that would have occurred had Labor been in government. We know that at the last election they made no financial commitment at all to maintain the increased quarantine initiative - in fact, they were actually going to take money out of the quarantine service and give it to their new 'coastguide' arrangements. This would effectively have torn the heart out of the intervention arrangements that have meant so much to protecting this country from pests and diseases. Remember, under Labor only five per cent of international mail was checked, practically no containers were checked and only about 25 per cent of passengers could expect their baggage to be checked at the airport. That is the kind of standard that Labor would have delivered. The funding in this budget guarantees a high standard of border protection for Australia and an effective quarantine service that will do its job in keeping this country free of pests and diseases.</DOC>

 - The member for Lilley interjects, but I will say this for the member for Kennedy: at least he has the guts to get up and ask a question. The member for Lilley has not actually got to his feet to ask a question.In answer to the member for Kennedy, in relation to baseload power in Northern Australia I am aware that there are many industries, particularly in the north of Western Australia, where private investors actually build their own electricity generators. That is what happens with many of the mines in north-west Australia. Where the owner of the mines or the owner of the infrastructure does not build their own infrastructure, quite commonly state government takes responsibility. After all, the states are responsible for electricity generation. Is the best thing for the Commonwealth government to do to pick up all of the responsibilities for the failure of the Beattie government? Would it encourage the Beattie government to get more responsible if, by walking out of the field, the Commonwealth took over its obligations?In relation to water, can I say that the federal government has a National Water Initiative of $2 billion which is directed towards improving water. Regarding branch lines from Mount Isa to Adelaide and Darwin, I am not sure whether such a proposal has an economic case that would show that such a line would be profitable. If somebody does a feasibility study, I think it would be well worth having a look at such a thing, but I am not aware of any feasibility study that has been done that shows the advantages.Can I say this: obviously Northern Australia, particularly in relation to minerals development, makes an enormous contribution to our country. The member for Kennedy will have heard me speaking on the subject of infrastructure, particularly in relation to Dalrymple Bay and North Queensland, and the importance of improving things. I welcome the fact that the Queensland Competition Authority has now brought down its decision. I believe that may lead to more investment. It will be private investment; it will be good investment for Australia and will help in Australia's export of mineral commodities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also thank him for showing an interest in the budget, which was released last night, because this is a budget which is for Australia's future. This is a budget which will keep unemployment low. This is a budget which will keep inflation low. This is a budget which will keep net debt low. This is a budget which will improve funding for future generations. As question time finishes on the day after the budget, this opposition frontbench has distinguished itself by failing to ask a question of the Treasurer in relation to his budget. The intellectual attack on the budget with a question to the Treasurer was led by the member for Bendigo. -  - As is common on the day after a budget, the matter of public importance will be on the budget. Today the attack on the budget through the MPI will be led by the member for Hunter - not by the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley goes around counting his press appearances and claiming that he has done 100 press appearances this year. He needs to separate these into category A and category B: category A, where the press turned up, and category B, where they did not. Of that 100, a very large number are where his staff member puts a dictaphone in front of his mouth, transcribes and puts it out as a press conference. Category A and category B - ceaseless activity, but to no effect.This is the day after the budget and the member for Lilley asks no question of the Treasurer. The intellectual charge comes from the member for Bendigo and the MPI comes from the member for Hunter, and why? Because the collective intelligence between those three is greater than that of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the truth of the matter. There is no Labor attack on this budget other than cheap opportunism, because this is a budget for Australia's future.</DOC>

I can report that discussions are currently under way with the person in the Philippines, involving the Australian consul-general, and offers, if it is her wish, to return to Australia with government support have been made.In the meantime, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has indicated, this matter has been referred to Mr Palmer's inquiry. When the results of that inquiry, not only in relation to this issue but also in relation to Cornelia Rau, are available, the government will then consider what further steps should be taken in what appears on the face of it to be a very sad and unhappy circumstance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his questions and I can advise the House that hardworking Australian families will benefit from this budget when income tax cuts are passed through this parliament. Income tax cuts are due to come into effect for every Australian income tax payer on 1 July 2005. Thresholds will be changed at the upper end; rates will be cut at the lower end. In order to get those income tax cuts in place by 1 July 2005, legislation has to pass the House of Representatives and the Senate to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to publish the schedule so that employers know how much to take out and know to take out less after 1 July 2005.I am asked whether there are any alternative proposals. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party are going to vote against these income tax cuts. If they are able to vote against these income tax cuts, they have the capacity to delay an income tax cut to every Australian taxpayer. I am very confident that, when the new Senate assembles after 1 July, the new Senate will pass this law. They will not defeat this income tax cut. What they are able, at most, to do is to delay this income tax cut. If you ever wanted any evidence at all that Labor stands for higher taxes, you are getting it from the Leader of the Opposition now.I am pleased to see that not everybody in the Labor Party supports the Leader of the Opposition in his tactic of opposing income tax cuts. According to the Australian Financial Review today, one member of the Labor Party described this tactic as insane. According to the article 'Labor divided over tax cuts' in today's Australian, one long-serving Labor MP has said, 'We've blown our brains out.'Mr Laurie Ferguson was interviewed on the way into the parliament today and was asked these questions:JOURNALIST: Should Kim Beazley be opposing the Government's proposed tax cuts _?LAURIE FERGUSON: I think Kim and Wayne Swan will be handling that.JOURNALIST: What do you think though?LAURIE FERGUSON: They will be handling it ...JOURNALIST: Do you think you are setting yourself up for a political death?LAURIE FERGUSON: I think they are handling it ... They are handling it.That is precisely the problem: they are handling it.The income tax cuts have been supported by Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, who in fact said that these cuts could only be introduced because of the good work of the Western Australian people. They have been welcomed by Kevin Foley, the Labor Treasurer of South Australia. According to the ABC radio in the Northern Territory, Clare Martin has told Labor's two Northern Territory members not to oppose the cuts. 'That is the federal budget, and I would not be opposing tax cuts,' Clare Martin said. If the two Labor members from the Territory do not oppose the tax cuts that bill can go through the Senate, Australians can have the tax cuts that they deserve and they ought to be delivered on 1 July.</DOC>

 - I understand and respect the comments that are made by mental health experts. We always take them very carefully into account. I have indicated, in relation to both the Cornelia Rau incident and the latest case that was the subject of the first question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, that we first must establish the facts of what occurred. When we have the results of that inquiry the government will then be in a position to decide whether further examinations, further inquiries or further investigations are needed. I can assure the House that the government take these issues very seriously and we are as concerned as other Australians are to ensure that, first of all, we get to the bottom of what exactly happened in both cases. Then we will be in a more soundly based position to take decisions on action for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. The monthly labour force figures for April were released today and they showed that employment increased by 6,900 people in April. More importantly, they showed that the number of full-time jobs in April increased by 39,100 and that was offset by a decrease in part-time positions of 32,200. The consequence is that the unemployment rate remains at the lowest level in 28 years, at 5.1 per cent. More than that, this is the 21st consecutive month that unemployment has been below six per cent and the fifth consecutive month that it has been at 5.1 per cent. More important than that, the participation rate - that is, the participation in the work force - is at the highest level on record, at 64.5 per cent.Since this government was elected in March 1996, 1.6 million new jobs have been created in Australia. There are more Australians in work than ever before. The participation rate is the highest recorded. Now is the time to reform the welfare system to encourage more people into the work force. People never had a better chance of getting a job in the last 28 years than they had in the month of April in 2005. This indicates that the Australian economy continues to grow. There are still further reforms that have to be put in place to improve its capacity. But I think all Australians today will welcome the fact that job creation has been strong and unemployment low in the month of April.</DOC>

There is no doubt that the seven million Australians who do not live in the major centres of the country, those who live in regional Australia, will benefit from the government's tax reforms, presumed only, of course, that they are passed. They will give real cash-in-hand benefits to people in regional Australia and that will benefit average everyday workers in regional Australia - farm labourers, carpenters and electricians.I can provide an example - a butcher from the electorate of Groom. He has been in contact with my office. This butcher is not a wealthy Australian and he does not purport to be. He has a wife and two young kids and he works 40 hours during the week at a normal rate of $22 an hour, for a package of about $45,000 a year. But he is trying to get ahead and he has been doing a bit of overtime on Saturdays. He noted that he is basically on 30c in the dollar now, which is a lot better than what he was on under Labor, when he was paying 43c in the dollar on the old scales back in 1999. He also goes on to say, 'I hear all this talk about the proposed changes only being worth $6 a week to me.' He says: 'They're not; they're worth $31 a week to me. They are really worth having. They will make a difference and I would very much like to have those tax cuts.'I suspect that story is being told all over regional Australia as people shake their heads in absolute and total disbelief and, I would think, total bewilderment at the proposal by those opposite to oppose these measures. Indeed, I think country people everywhere will be wondering whether there is anything that is good for regional Australians that the Labor Party are actually prepared to support. Is there anything at all? They oppose not only the tax cuts; they oppose Roads to Recovery, they oppose Regional Partnerships and they oppose Sustainable Regions. They oppose everything.There is a very interesting question that must be asked of some particular members in this place. There are not many regional members in the federal parliament from the Australian Labor Party. But there are some: the member for Capricornia, the member for Hunter, the member for Richmond, the member for Ballarat and the member for Lingiari. The questions that have to be asked are: will they all be in here tonight, which way will they vote and will they then go home and explain to their constituents that they opposed tax cuts for workers in regional Australia? In particular, it has to be asked whether the member for Lingiari will personally explain to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, why he opposed her recommendation that they get on with the job and pass the tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that the family he referred to is more than $500 a month better off as a result of the lower interest rates under this government. I am very happy to confirm that. I can also confirm that that particular family will be better off as a result of the tax cuts that the Leader of the Opposition is trying to block. I am not surprised, at this question time, by the sombre demeanour of those who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition - they are more attentive than usual to their electorate correspondence during question time - or by the restrained enthusiasm they have demonstrated as the Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. I think that one of the more amusing press statements on the budget was one that came out this morning from my friend the prospective leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bill Shorten. He endorsed our policy in black-and-white when he said:The top marginal income tax rate thresholds should be raised to create a fair, productive and competitive tax system.He put out a statement yesterday saying that the AWU rejects the Prime Minister's budget claims. That is a pretty extraordinary example. All I can conclude is that on the subject of taxation relief, given what Mr Shorten said, he has already as a prospective leader of the Labor Party learnt something from the current leader of the Labor Party, and that is the capacity to walk both sides of the street on the one issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. Coming from Western Australia, he knows how important it is to have a very strong domestic economy as a platform for Australia's exporters. To make the most of global market opportunities we have to work off a strong economic base in Australia, and that has been the absolute focus of our government since 1996. In this year's budget we continued our commitment to strong, sustainable growth that provides further opportunities for Australia's exporters to benefit from a strong economy. It is a budget that delivers an $8.9 billion surplus; it forecasts three per cent growth in the GDP; it forecasts a seven per cent increase in export volumes - not values, but volumes; and it also delivers about $1.8 billion worth of tax relief to enhance the competitiveness of Australian businesses - in particular, Australian export businesses - including the abolition of the three per cent concessional tariff on imported business inputs. The budget also delivers $21.7 billion worth of personal income tax cuts to help create a more competitive work force.These reforms build on previous reforms that we have introduced. We need to recall the tax reform package that also delivered a $3½ billion tax benefit to exports. You would recall, Mr Speaker, that in the tax reform package we took $3½ billion worth of embedded wholesale sales tax burden off the back of our exports. You would also recall that back then those measures were opposed all the way by the Labor Party and by the Leader of the Opposition in his previous incarnation. Ultimately they were passed and, of course, we know the results have been significantly beneficial to Australia's export industries.We get a sense of deja vu this week. This government is proposing significant tax cuts to improve the competitiveness of Australia and, again, they are being opposed by the Leader of the Opposition in his latest incarnation. He will never learn. We have continued to prove the benefits of a strong economy for Australia's exporters - a strong, competitive and efficient economic base to compete in the global marketplace. This budget is all about taking that further and doing more. But, shamefully, the Leader of the Opposition is going to continue to oppose these measures, as he has done for years and years and years.I believe we will ultimately win this debate. The Australian people want these tax cuts delivered. There are many members of the Labor Party backbench who also want them. There was an article in the Daily Telegraph headed 'Kamikaze Kim: Labor blocks cuts'. There was an article in the Australian in which there was a comment from a Labor Party MP who is obviously a former union official. The article states:One critic of the decision said Labor was likely to cop a backlash from middle Australia. 'I was a union official for many years,' the MP said.'You don't knock back a pay rise.'I think the millions of Australian workers who want this pay rise would agree with him and would want the opposition to support the government in delivering these tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. She has shown a long-term commitment to Indigenous health. I can take this opportunity to reassure her and all members of the House that overall this has been a good budget for health, with 98 separate measures and $3.3 billion worth of additional spending over the forward estimates period. Importantly, there is $170 million more for Indigenous health. That is important and necessary because, quite tragically, Indigenous people have a life expectancy some 20 years below that of the wider Australian community.In particular, there is $40 million more for the Primary Health Care Access Program. That should mean four new clinics in Indigenous communities and an additional 50 health care workers, doctors and nurses. There is an additional $102 million for the Healthy for Life program. That should mean an additional 200 health professionals in Indigenous health clinics around the country, particularly targeting child and maternal health and chronic disease management. And there is $9 million to supply unsniffable petrol to an additional 23 Indigenous communities. Overall, Indigenous-specific health spending will be 21 per cent more next year than this year. Indigenous-specific health spending is up. Since 1996, it has more than doubled in real terms.I should take this chance to mention that Indigenous health has been a particular interest of the retiring president of the AMA, Dr Bill Glasson. I want to express in this place my appreciation of the leadership that he has shown over the last two years.</DOC>

 - The national wage case positions that have been taken by the government have been based on its assessment of what is good for the economy and good for the employees of this country. Even for the member for Perth, the evidence is on display today: the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years. How can any Labor spokesman on workplace relations have the hide to ask questions on things like that when, under this government, not only has unemployment fallen but real wages have risen? This government, the Howard government, is not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had; the Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had. We have delivered. We have delivered jobs to Australian workers. We have delivered tax cuts to Australian workers, and we want to deliver more, but you are trying to stop us. We have delivered lower interest rates to Australian workers. We have delivered a future to Australian workers that was never even dreamed of under the former Labor government. We will continue to take approaches to the management of the national economy that are designed to promote fair outcomes for low- and middle-income earners.I refer the member for Perth to the recent research of NATSEM which showed that, under the tax and payments policies of this government, the bottom 60 per cent of Australian families have been left in a much better position. When you compare every group, you find that they were better off under the policies of this government than they had been under the policies of the former government.Of all the things this government has achieved, there is nothing I am more proud of than the fact that the average worker has been looked after. The average Australian worker is better off. That is why those workers voted in their thousands against the Australian Labor Party at the last election. It will always be the commitment of this government that we look after the interests of the working men and women of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for the question and for the interest he has in security measures. I note that for his constituents in Townsville this is a particularly significant issue. This budget is yet another example of the determination of the government to continue to enhance the security of our nation and of the Australian people.We have provided over $67 million over four years to develop biometrics for border control, to provide Australians with highly secure and reliable passports. Australian passports will be leaders in the world. We have provided nearly $100 million over four years for security enhancement to our embassies, bringing our total commitment across all agencies for that particular purpose since 2002 to around $1 billion. Obviously, the government places the highest priority on the safety of the thousands of Australian and foreign visitors to our missions abroad, as well as the safety of the people who work in those missions. Indeed, the security measures we had put in place at the Jakarta embassy saved many lives in September last year, when that embassy was bombed.We are also providing in the budget a further $22 million over four years to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, to boost the collection of intelligence on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and also to ensure that Australia can play a significant part in the strategy of our allies and our friends, particularly in the region, to encourage joint action against international proliferation activities. We have also provided $9 million over four years to ASIS as part of an additional package of $40 million to a range of agencies - which will be coordinated by my department - to boost regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism. I note that since 1995-96 this government has increased expenditure on the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and lifted it up to be an organisation we can be proud of, representing and promoting the interests of Australia. We have increased spending by 130 per cent in real terms. We do take its work very seriously.It is worth noting that, since financial year 2001-02, the government has committed over $5.5 billion to national security issues. This budget should remind Australians that this is a government that is determined to take the fight to its enemies.</DOC>

 - The changes that were announced by the Treasurer do involve a situation where, if you are currently -  -  - Small things amuse small minds, Mr Speaker - very much so. At least the member for Sydney has asked a question which is relevant to a reform in the budget, and I am very grateful that she has. It provides me with an opportunity to explain the rationale of the changes. We believe that it is better to be in work than on welfare. We believe that we should provide encouragement and incentive for people to transfer from welfare to work and we believe that the way our program has been structured it will achieve that goal. The calculations are that more than 180,000 people will find employment over the forward estimates period as a result of these measures. We believe that the $2 billion which the government is investing over the forward estimates period to provide training and assistance for people to move from welfare into work and to assist people who might otherwise have been on the disability support pension is a very good investment not only in the future of the economy but in the futures of the people involved.There is no future in a welfare policy which provides incentives for people to remain on welfare rather than to go into the work force. That is the rationale of the policy and I think it is a policy that has been widely supported by the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I also know about the value of experience. I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I know that, as a new member, he has a very real interest in the plight of Australian families. He seems to be more aware than members opposite of the very significant investment in the family law system contained in the budget - almost $400 million committed over four years. It will create a new system, a new culture; it will help hundreds of thousands of families through relationship difficulties. It is comprehensive and it is targeted at every stage of relationships: pre-marriage, with counselling and educational services; early intervention, with over 100 services to keep families together by helping them to resolve difficulties before they become insurmountable; and immediately after separation, with $188 million in family relationship centres to help separating families before conflict becomes entrenched. For when contact arrangements break down, it quadruples contact orders - programs to help separated parents where conflict is entrenched. There are also 30 new children's contact services - safe houses for handing over childrenThe important changes that are contained here will also help people resolve their disputes before having to involve the courts of Australia. It is an area in which there is too much litigation and not enough mediation. We want to change the culture of family separations. We want to stop people fighting in the courtrooms instead of sitting down and working these issues through. The major initiative here is the network of 65 new and innovative family relationship centres, which will be the front door to the new family law system. It has associated with it a number of other significant benefits: an outreach program for servicing rural families, some for the first time; a national family telephone advice line; and family resource centres will be established, not only in capital cities but also in major regional centres.These measures have been very warmly welcomed. The major organisations involved in dealing with family relationships - Catholic Welfare Australia, Family Services Australia and Relationships Australia - yesterday put out a statement congratulating the government on its commitment to supporting family relationships. I want to quote people from two of those organisations. Frank Quinlan, Executive Director of Catholic Welfare Australia, said:We support a less adversarial Family Law System and the Family Relationships Centres proposal seems to go a long way towards meeting this aim whilst ensuring the children involved are protected. Children's welfare must be paramount ...Sarah Lees, National Manager of Family Services Australia, said:This is the outcome we have been looking for. For years the industry has been speaking as one voice, the voice of the child and of the family. This budget is an indication that we have been listened to and Australian families have been listened to ...</DOC>

 - The member for Sydney has completely misrepresented the government's policies. Anybody who is unable to work will continue to receive the disability support pension. The implication in the honourable member's question is wrong. The second observation I would make is that I think there is wide community support for a policy that endeavours to ensure that people who are, in any common understanding of the term, unable to work, continue to receive in full the disability support pension. That is our policy. But for those who are able to do part-time work it is not unreasonable, on an entirely prospective basis - and that is the policy - to adopt a different approach in relation to those people. That is the common understanding of the policy. That, in plain language, is what the policy means. I think it is a policy that not only is good for the community but, more importantly, is good for the people concerned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. We are glad he is here; he is a very strong member for that wonderful part of the eastern outskirts of Melbourne. I have been out there. I have seen how effectively he is working with his local community, and we want him to keep it up too. Well done to you. The budget, he will be pleased to know, delivers all of the government's election commitments extremely well. In fact, $1.4 billion in new initiatives will provide for skills needs. It is the biggest ever commitment to the vocational and technical education sector by any government.In total the Howard government's 10th budget delivers $10.1 billion over the next four years. The government is offering more than $4.9 billion to the state governments of Australia, provided they are effective in the use of their funding for the institutes of TAFE and, of course, private training providers. We want to see a change to the system. We have another 116,400 places on offer at the moment and we want to make certain it is no longer simply the doctors and the lawyers of Australia that can travel from one state to another and practise their professions. We would actually like to see the plumbers and the electricians being able to do the same thing. It is ridiculous: if you are a hairdresser trained in Queensland today, you are not allowed to cut hair in New South Wales. Can you believe that? It has only been in recent months that a hairdresser trained in Victoria has been able to cut hair in New South Wales, provided they are over the age of 21. Can you believe that? - No Victorian hairdressers are touching the Prime Minister's head, but these are the sorts of things which are real in Australia today. Three hundred and fifty-one million dollars over the next five years will establish 24 Australian technical colleges. - They are in areas with skills needs all around Australia. You know what, the member for Grayndler reminds me that the Labor Party offered zero dollars over zero years for the same sort of approach. Five hundred and twenty-six million dollars over four years will extend the entitlement to youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy for new apprentices. An extra 31,500 pre-vocational and training places will be provided over the next four years. After 1 July, $120 million will be provided for $800 toolkits for use by apprentices on the successful completion of the first few months of an apprenticeship. It will then belong to the new apprentice after 12 months. One hundred and six million dollars will be provided for scholarships via two $500 payments for new apprentices who complete the first and second year of a new apprenticeship in a trade within the area of skills needs in a small or medium business. These are real commitments and real dollars - a record commitment by this government to the important area of Australia's skills needs.</DOC>

 - I would have thought it was self-evident that, if you expect - and it is a projection made by the Treasury - some 180,000 to enter the work force over a period of time, not all of those people would have children in need of child care. Many of them would have children who do not need child care. Quite a number of them would not have children. The calculation has been made on that commonsense basis.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She is somebody who, like most members in this parliament, is keen to see people who are of working age and who have a work capacity get back into work. This government knows that people who are coming off welfare and into work and who do have a work capacity lead much better and more fulfilling lives, not just for them but for their parents. It is part of the reason, of course, that in this country we have an unemployment rate at a 27-year low. The Howard government is investing almost $400 million in helping parents back into the work force, which includes 137,000 employment preparation places. We are helping people through the Job Network system by providing training and support to those who most need it.In the budget this week, this government announced that people with disabilities will be the beneficiaries of an investment of $555 million to help them get back into the work force, with over 100,000 places in employment services for job seekers with disabilities, including over 20,000 places for disability open employment services. Places for vocational rehabilitation required by those people will be delivered by this government. The very long-term unemployed are also beneficiaries of this government's program, with over $360 million provided to help the long-term unemployed back into work. As the Prime Minister said earlier in question time, this government is a great friend of those people who are looking for work, and will provide them with the opportunities.</DOC>

 - Could I say, with all due respect to the member for Sydney, that she and other members of the opposition should try and make up their minds regarding the government's decision, to use the parlance, to grandfather existing disability support pension beneficiaries. There are some 700,000 of those. They are not required to meet the obligations, or they will not be subject to the same test. Self-evidently, therefore, a comparison of the total number of people receiving benefits and pensions with the total number of training places made available represents a total misunderstanding - deliberately I suspect - of the government's policy. On the one hand, the opposition are saying that there is something wrong. They said it on the night the Treasurer brought down the budget. They said it then that something was wrong and unfair -  - My colleague reminds me that it was not reformist enough. In other words, what they were implying for that audience, the financial community audience, on budget night was that they were not being tough enough: they should apply this new regime to those still on the disability support pension. But now they are running a different line. They are up here trying to say, 'This over here doesn't equal that over there.' Obviously, this over here does not meet that over there. This over here is not meant to meet that over there because they are two entirely different cohorts.I just say again that, if you are on the disability support pension, you are not affected by the new rules. Self-evidently, it will take many years for those coming onto the disability support pension or applying for it for the first time to reach the stock of those who are already on it. Can I say to the member for Sydney that she should go back and carefully read the Treasurer's announcement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question and note his interest in these matters. The Australian government recognises that, with the ageing of the population, there will be an increasing demand for health and aged care services, which is why the Australian government has more than doubled funding for health and aged care. In aged care there has been a 140 per cent increase since 1996. Along with the measures announced by the Treasurer in the area of health, $3.3 billion worth of initiatives, senior Australians will welcome the extra funding in aged care. Building on the $2.2 billion package delivered last year, the single largest investment in aged care by any government at any time, this budget delivers a further $528 million in specific aged care services.We all know that the prevalence of dementia will increase as the population ages. This government is delivering a further $320 million in funding on top of the $2.6 billion that we already invest to ensure that people who are living with dementia, their carers and their families can receive appropriate support by way of earlier diagnosis, more training and education for aged care workers and more places for people living with dementia.In this budget we have also increased funding for carers. These people carry out the very demanding role of caring for older Australians. On top of the $100 million we already invest in carers support, a further $208 million in support for carers is contained in this budget. This will enable people who are employed to place their loved ones with day centres that will have longer hours. There will be more weekend respite and more overnight respite. This budget also includes funding for up to 1,700 nurses who will be focusing on aged care over the next four years.But the budget is not just about health and aged care. There is also financial support for seniors with initiatives in the Medicare levy threshold and the senior Australian tax offset threshold, in relation to the seniors concession allowance and the seniors utilities allowance. Because of the strong financial management of the Australian economy, this government can deliver real outcomes, real services and real support for older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for raising with me an issue that is very important to debate on public policy in this country, and that is: which side of politics is better at looking after the interests of workers in this country? The reality is that, in the time that we have been in government, real wages since 1996 have increased by 14.1 per cent. Under the previous Labor government real wages rose by just 1.2 per cent in 13 years. This is relevant because every time I hear somebody from the Labor Party talking about workplace relations reform, do you know what they say? They say, 'The coalition wants to cut real wages.' They said it in 1996, they said it in 1997, they said it in 1998 and they have been saying it ever since. But what is the reality? The reality, in contrast to the fiction, is that under us real wages have gone up. I say again to this parliament: I had no prouder boast in the last election campaign than to say to the people of Western Sydney that the coalition had done more for the workers of Australia than the Labor Party could ever have dreamt of doing. And that will be the same when the government's workplace relations reforms are unveiled. Predictably, as surely as day follows night, the Leader of the Opposition will be up here saying, 'Oh, they are going to cut real wages,' just as he said in 1996. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you were wrong in 1996 and you will be wrong again in 2005.</DOC>

 - There is no confusion. Quite plainly, as I indicated earlier, to the extent that we get a seasonal break the impact on the economy will be minimised. Or, put the other way around, the sooner it breaks and people get an opportunity to put their crops in, to harvest crops and to turn stock off, the better the growth forecast will be. It is quite obvious that many people are still in drought. The budget fully provides for them. That provision is untapped and is going out at the rate of about $4 million a week. But it is also the case, as every farmer knows, that, even as we speak, if we get good rain within the next few days, a lot of the pain that we unfortunately anticipate might happen - and which we are making provision for - may not yet happen.I hope that everyone in this place would join me in hoping that over the next few days the weather forecast might turn around, we might get good rain and we might get a good wheat and cereal crop. In that sense, can I say that with the best will in the world you cannot accurately foretell what is going to happen in rural and regional Australia. But I make this very important point: if there is one thing the farm sector is glad of, it is that sound economic management has meant that interest rates have been much lower than they otherwise would have been. We remember the horrors for farmers of the 1980s and the 1990s, and if there is a second thing they can be thankful for, it is that we are in a financial position in this nation to ensure that as many as possible of them get through. If the ALP, with their sudden, new-found concern for the welfare of the farmers in this country, want to be regarded as quite genuine, the first thing they could do is to trot off and talk to their state colleagues about what they are going to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I can inform the House that one of the great differences between the two sides of politics represented in this House is that this side of the House believes that Australians ought to have tax cuts on 1 July and the other side of the House opposes them.We ought to be very clear about this: the Australian Labor Party believes that no tax cuts should be brought in from 1 July 2005. Can I also say that, in addition, this side of the House believes that senior Australians should get tax cuts and the Labor Party believes they should not. By opposing a reduction in the lowest tax rate from 17c to 15c - and I do not think this has occurred yet to the Leader of the Opposition - he opposes senior Australians getting a tax cut under the last budget that this government brought down.In addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition talks about equity. And what is his equity? His equity is that if you are a low-income earner over 65 you should get no tax cut. That is his equity. This side of the House stands up for senior Australians while the so-called tax plan of the Australian Labor Party would cheat them out of any tax cut at all. I say to senior Australians who qualify for the senior Australians tax offset: look very carefully at the fine print of what the Australian Labor Party was talking about when it was in this House giving its budget reply.I can go on. In addition to tax cuts, which we say should take place on 1 July and which the Labor Party say should not, this government has also increased the family tax benefit. Under the budget, which I announced, the family tax benefit part A threshold increases from $33,361 to $37,500, providing 400,000 low-income families with an additional $12.55 a week. That is, again, something that the Labor Party have not even agreed to at this stage. And let me say that family tax benefit A is real money - $600 goes into a bank account, comes out of a bank account and can buy goods and services. It is the same $600 which the Australian Labor Party promised to abolish if they were elected at the last election for all of those low-income Australian families the Leader of the Opposition heartlessly had no concern for in the last election. These changes mean that a single-income couple with one child under five and two dependent children have had a 29.5 per cent increase in their real disposable income since 1996 and, with the family tax benefit cashouts, effectively pay no net tax until they earn $46,000.I am asked: 'What is it that would ensure that the government could meet its tax promises?' I will tell you what it is: the cessation of this useless blocking activity which the Leader of the Opposition is trying to put in place. The schedules that employers need to apply these tax cuts on 1 July 2005 are being prepared by the taxation commissioner. They can be disallowed by either house of the parliament. If they are disallowed in the Senate on the votes of the Australian Labor Party then 850,000 Australian employers will be thrown into confusion and Australians will not get their tax cut on 1 July 2005. Let me make this clear to the House: Labor will not block tax cuts. The very most that this useless blocking activity can accomplish is confusion for employers and a delay in those tax cuts. This side of the House stands for tax cuts on 1 July 2005, and we call on the Australian Labor Party to get out of the way and let Australians have them.</DOC>

 - I have got several answers to that question.An honourable member - Where do you start? - Where do I start? I could start with the $36 million that you could give the working Australian people by handing back the ill-gotten gains of Centenary House. But let me simply say that, in relation to the disclosure limits, I remind the parliament that when the legislation about disclosure was introduced by the former Labor government a threshold of $1,000 in 1984 was fixed. That was increased during the term of the former government to $1,500. I believe that there is a case for further increasing it; I make no bones about that.I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has been running around talking about corruption. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you Mr Speaker, that he does his own party a disservice, as well as a disservice to the party that I am proud to lead and the National Party, by talking about corruption. The reality is that, in the more than 100 years of Federation in this country, politics at a national level has been blessedly free of corruption on both sides. Therefore, all I can say is that in the name of cheap populism the Leader of the Opposition does as great a disservice to his own party as he does to the Liberal Party of Australia. There is a case for adjusting those disclosure levels, just as there is the case for, from time to time, adjusting the levels of tax deductibility of contributions. I do not apologise for saying that, and at an appropriate time we will give attention to the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and, together with the member for Robertson, for putting on a fantastic post-budget event quite recently in Gosford. Of course, one side of Australian politics believes that taxes should be cut on 1 July 2005; the other side of politics believes that there should be no tax cuts on 1 July 2005. In the extraordinary performance which he gave in reply to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition released a statement that says that there should be no change on 1 July 2005. I do not know if it has occurred to the Leader of the Opposition yet, but his tax changes are due to take effect on 1 July 2006. That just happens to be 13 or 14 months away. There is only one side of Australian politics that wants to cut taxes on 1 July 2005.The second point that I will explain to the Labor Party backbench - because they do sometimes have a tendency to believe what their leader says - is that the Labor Party wants to introduce a welfare-to-work income offset. If you read the fine print, you will see that this increase of $680, this new welfare-to-work bonus, is to apply - wait for this - from 1 July 2008. The next federal election is in October 2007. The Leader of the Opposition has a tax cut for July 2008 - one for the next parliament. I also point out that the change in the welfare-to-work bonus from 1 January in a full year would amount to a tax cut of $5 for anybody on $20,000 or less, but in the current financial year, because the Leader of the Opposition will introduce it only on 1 January, it would amount to a tax cut of $2.55 for people on $20,000 or less.Can I also point out that, because the Leader of the Opposition does not reduce the tax rate from 17c to 15c, and tries to cover that up with a welfare-to-work bonus, senior Australians do not get anything. Senior Australians do not qualify for the welfare-to-work bonus; they qualify under the senior Australian tax offset.So there is no tax cut on 1 July and no so-called $12 at all until 2008. In the current financial year, if you are on $20,000 or less, there is $2.50. And at the end of all of that, the Leader of the Opposition has a tax plan which, strangely enough, seems to be about the same value as the one which the government announced in the budget. That is funny. It is funny you should say that and funny you should announce it on Thursday. On Tuesday and Wednesday the opposition was claiming, was it not, that cutting taxes would put up interest rates? Then, on Thursday, it came out with a plan to cut taxes more. It is such a strong economic attack! - Withering. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition interjects so loudly. The interjections always rise in volume as his case gets weaker.What does this mean? What this means is that one side of Australian politics stands for a tax cut on 1 July, one side of Australian politics will deliver higher benefits to lower income earners, one side of Australian politics is delivering family tax benefits, one side of Australian politics will have its tax plan take part in this parliament rather than in the next parliament, and one side of Australian politics is now standing between the Australian people and the tax cut which they deserve on 1 July 2005. What we say to the Australian Labor Party is this: you will not defeat tax cuts. Those opposite will not defeat them. The new Senate, at the very last, will pass them. All Labor can do for Australians is to delay the tax cuts which they deserve. We say to the Australian Labor Party: get out of the way and let those people have the tax cuts they deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley; I really do. I really thank the member for Lilley for that question. It is very, very kind of him. Both the Treasurer and I understand the difficulties that families in this country on modest incomes face. That is why we have been more generous to them than any former government has. It is amazing that the member for Lilley should talk about an annual income in the $40,000 range when, in answer to an earlier question, the Treasurer made the point that, because of the tax and family payment reforms of this government, a single-income family with two dependent children, with one of those children under five, has to get to $46,000 a year in income before they are, in net terms, paying any tax. It is that kind of reform that enables an independent organisation, NATSEM, headed by Ann Harding, to actually assert from her independence that, under this government, the position of low-income families, especially single-income families and especially sole parents, has improved enormously and that the bottom 60 per cent of taxpayers have enjoyed net gains from the tax and payment system at the expense of the top 40 per cent.The reality is that, if you look at the budgets of this government, you see a continuum not only of strong economic policy - an economic policy, for example, that has seen unemployment fall to its lowest level in 30 years, has seen real wages rise by 14.1 per cent against a miserable 1.2 per cent under the former Labor government and has seen the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees average 67 over the last nine years, compared with an average of more than 190 days under the former government, the so-called friend of Australian workers, the so-called maestros of the industrial relations system of this country, the ultimate conductors, the ultimate producers, of industrial harmony in the country - but also of where in budget after budget we have given more and more to low- and middle-income families.We have boosted the family tax benefits. We boosted them in the last election campaign. We will pay the $600 a child and, as the months go by after 1 July, there will be a reminder for about two million Australian families. When they receive the $600 a child payment they will be reminded that, if they had voted for the Labor Party at the last election, that $600 would have been taken from them. It remains a policy of the Australian Labor Party.Can I say to the member for Lilley: under your policies, a family on $40,000 a year with two children would be worse off to the tune of at least $12,000 per annum. They would be worse off because they would be paying higher interest rates - and we have got the evidence to prove it - and they would face greater job insecurity and lower real wages. So if you are looking for a friend of low-income Australians, you will find them all on this side of the parliament.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Braddon for the great interest that he displays in the forest industry in Tasmania. Can I say how pleased I was to go to Tasmania a little over a week ago, along with him and the member for Bass, and in the company - let me give him full credit - of the Labor Premier of Tasmania, who is a lot more in touch with the interests of the working people of Tasmania than any of his federal colleagues. Let me say how very pleased I am that I was able to conclude a historic agreement with the Premier of Tasmania which guaranteed the jobs of the workers in the forest industry in Tasmania and delivered a $250 million program to which the Tasmanian government contributed about $90 million and the federal government $160 million. It will involve investments in programs to support industry, jobs, the community and the environment.This agreement - which will result in almost 90 per cent of the Tarkine being preserved from any logging, which strikes a fair balance between the interests of the environment, the interests of workers and the need to provide security and stability for the industry, which commits 170,000 hectares of old-growth forests to reserves, and which will result in over one million hectares being held in reserve - could never have been negotiated other than by a federal coalition government. Labor in the last election showed a willingness to put at risk the jobs of thousands of timber workers in Tasmania because they were desperately craving the indulgence of Green preferences on the mainland. They showed disdain, contempt and indifference to the interests of their traditional blue-collar workers and they rightly paid the price when the election came along.Can I simply say to the government of Tasmania that the cooperative spirit in which this agreement has been negotiated is an example of what can be achieved when governments work together and when governments care about the job security of average Australians. It was a coalition federal government that was prepared to act to save the jobs of the timber workers. It was a punitive federal Labor government that could not have cared less about the jobs of those timber workers in Tasmania. They were desperately craving the preferences of Green voters on the mainland, many of whom saw through their cynicism, and they paid a doubly heavy price.Can I finally say what I said at the signing ceremony in Tasmania: I place on record my appreciation of the cooperative spirit displayed by the construction division of the CFMEU. On this occasion, that division acted with a sensitive regard to the rights and interests of their members. That division was pro the interests of the Australian workers and they were willing in that cause to make common cause with the coalition. I finally say what a delight it was to make that announcement with my colleagues the member for Bass and the member for Braddon. I know that for many years into the future they will continue to represent the interests of the workers of Northern Tasmania.</DOC>

 - I will take a moment or two to analyse every part of that question, and, if I can add anything further to the answer I am about to give, I will. The basis on which the question is framed is that somehow or other all of the high-income electorates in this place are represented by this side of politics and all of the low-income electorates are represented by the other side. In fact that is not right. I saw a table the other day that showed that of the 10 electorates with the lowest incomes only one of them was not held by the coalition. I know that we represent a broader church in this place now than we might have in earlier days, and I know that the spectrum of people who are supporting the coalition is getting wider. It is the Labor Party that is narrowing its base to the inner metropolitan elite. I understand that.The proposition is that we are only interested in representing these wonderful electorates like North Sydney, Higgins and Warringah. We are proud to represent those people. We are also very proud, equally proud, to represent the low-income electorates like Wide Bay, the low-income electorates in Northern Tasmania and the low-income electorates like Paterson and Longman. The list goes on and on.I give this bit of advice to the member for Hunter, who I think is a person of good disposition: forget about this old idea that the Liberal Party and the National Party are in favour of all the rich people and you are in favour of all the workers. You have proved again and again that you do not understand the aspirations of the Australian worker, let alone have a capacity to represent them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and his obvious interest in this important issue to all Australians - because every Australian taxpayer will be receiving a tax cut thanks to the Howard government's 2005 budget. The member for Cowper will be interested to know that the tax office is working very hard to find an answer to the confusion that has been put upon the Australian workplace, on all of the 860,000-odd employers who are out there trying to find a way through, as to how to deliver the tax cuts so richly deserved by hardworking Australians. The way it is having to do this is that the Tax Commissioner is having to put out not one but two sets of formulas of withholding tax so businesses can actually deliver those tax cuts to the hands of workers from 1 July. It is having to give out to workplaces - to 130,000 employers who actually have their own internal formulas - two separate formulas. The hope is that the Labor Party will get out of the way and allow these tax cuts to go through in time. In the event that they do not - in the event that the Labor Party keep stymieing Australian workers from receiving the tax cuts they richly deserve - there will be two sets of formulas so workplaces will be able to implement the tax cuts the Treasurer announced in the 2004 budget to be introduced from 1 July.Then we also have the software providers out there who inform my office that there will be some cost of perhaps $10 million to them in wasted time and energy for one reason: the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party continue to stand in the way of a progressive tax system delivering tax cuts to Australian workers. To answer the member for Cowper's question, there is only one thing that needs to happen. Today in this place the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Lilley needs to stand up here and say: 'We will get out of the way. We will allow the tax cuts to go through. Let the ATO do its work. Let business get on with making a profit and delivering for the Australian economy and for Australian workers.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. He of course validated everything I said earlier in question time. Every time there is talk of changes to the workplace relations system the Labor Party jump up and say, 'They're going to cut real wages.' They said that in 1996, they said it again in 1998 and they are saying it again now. Can I say in reply to the member for Perth that, just as over the last 9½ years you have been proved wrong, you will also be proved wrong as a result of these changes.These changes will deliver enormous benefits to the Australian economy. They will boost productivity. They will continue the process of real wage maintenance and gains that have been the case over the last 9½ years. Far from this being an exercise in cutting wages, this is an exercise in boosting the productivity of the Australian work force, this is an exercise in further strengthening the Australian economy, this is an exercise in winning for the Australian economy an even greater share of the globalised economy. Just as the old-fashioned, out-of-date, negative rhetoric of the Australian Labor Party has been proved wrong over the last 9½ years, you will be proved wrong when you see these reforms. The last thing I would say to the member for Perth is: do not believe everything you read in the newspapers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Labor Party are into the big issues today. We look forward to hearing the Mark Latham annual lecture, by the way - given, no doubt, by the member for Hunter. Talk about revisionism! The judgment of the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court meant that the Australian police elements as part of the Enhanced Cooperation Program had no legal authority to exercise political powers in Papua New Guinea. This, in turn, exposed Enhanced Cooperation Program employees to criminal liability in carrying out their work. The police have withdrawn from Papua New Guinea - they did so on 17 May. But the non-police Enhanced Cooperation Program officials who will continue on in Papua New Guinea will do so as advisers only, not in in-line positions.Already the Enhanced Cooperation Program has achieved good results. There have been improvements in law and order in Port Moresby. The financial and management structures within the government in Papua New Guinea have been improved. It is very important to remember that the Enhanced Cooperation Program, whilst it has undoubtedly been quite controversial in Papua New Guinea, has been very warmly welcomed by the people of Papua New Guinea. The public have been enormously supportive of it.Both the Australian government and the Papua New Guinea government want to find a solution to enable the Enhanced Cooperation Program to continue. We will be working on that. We have had some discussions at officials level. I am expecting the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, and the Minister for Internal Security, Bire Kimisopa, to visit Canberra later this week so we can begin discussions on how we sort out the legal questions. There is obviously a real difficulty when the court has found that the legislation implementing the treaty is unconstitutional. This is a decision of the court. We will all abide by the decision of the court - obviously, the Papua New Guinea government wants to do so - but we also agree that we would like to get the program back on its feet. Once we find an appropriate legal solution to that, the program will be fully reinstated.</DOC>

 - Anybody who is currently on what I think they call 'parenting payment single' will not have their payment affected. They will have an obligation, but they will not have it affected. The member for Sydney appears to be proceeding under the same misunderstanding as evidenced by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, in a statement he put out today. It completely overlooks the fact that under the new arrangements which will apply to people newly coming on to the sole parent benefit after 1 July 2006 a single parent family with four dependent children under the age of 16 will receive a $16,000 per annum tax-free family tax benefit A. It also ignores the tax-free $2,000 per annum the single parent would receive if one of the children were under five. The total family tax benefit payable to a single parent family with four children aged over six in the circumstances described by Labor would be more than $614 per fortnight, tax free. Yet in his press statement the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate speaks of that family having to 'survive' - that is the expression used by Senator Evans - on $813.80 a fortnight, deliberately or inadvertently omitting the $614 a fortnight that that family would receive in family tax benefits. I know that the Labor Party do not think family tax benefits are real, particularly when they have a '6' in front of them, but I would have thought on something as fundamental as this that they would have got their facts right.We have unapologetically introduced a new system. What it means for people currently on the sole parent benefit is that, when the youngest child reaches six, a person will be obliged to take on a part-time work responsibility. People coming into the system for the first time will continue to get the sole parent benefit, it is now understood, until the youngest child reaches the age of six and then the enhanced Newstart allowance will operate. There is, effectively, 13 months notice being given of that. We think the combination of policy contained in this system will result in more of these people going into the work force. We think that is good for them. We think it is good for the community. We think it would be a good idea if the Labor Party sat down and made an effort to understand the new proposal before attacking it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and acknowledge his role as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation and their recent report, Working for Australia's future: increasing participation in the workforce. The Australian Industry Group today released a survey of some 700 employers, and this report from the Australian Industry Group is welcomed by the government - in particular, the remark made by the Chief Executive of AiG, Heather Ridout, in her foreword, in which she says that further reform to Australia's workplace relations system is 'an important element of the drive to make the Australian economy work even better'. These comments stand in marked contrast to statements by the Leader of the Opposition, who just last month argued that 'the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry'. So we have a clear message coming from business, from a survey of some 700 employers through the AiG, saying that they want further workplace relations reform, yet the Leader of the Opposition is saying that this has been squeezed dry. In fact, he said just last week:... those changes simply are not going to provide a new wave of productivity growth - the major reforms in this field are now in place.Last week, in his reply to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition was talking about the test of leadership. Here is a test of leadership for the Leader of the Opposition: will he stand up to the vested interests in his party and the labour movement and pursue an industrial relations policy that puts the national interest of Australia first? Will he do that? Does he have the leadership to listen to the voice of business when business is saying over and over again that further reform is necessary? The reality of the industrial relations changes which this government has put in place has meant more than a 14 per cent increase in real wages for Australians, compared with about 1.2 per cent under 13 years of the Labor Party. Our government will make tough decisions. We will not shirk the issues - unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who must be the first politician to ever suffer reform fatigue whilst still in opposition.</DOC>

 - I can understand the enthusiasm of the member for Bass, because I can inform him that the GP bulk-billing rate in Tasmania is up 18.4 per cent since December 2003. We had not a single word on health from the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply or in his National Press Club speech, because of the divisions on his frontbench over the so-called Medicare Gold policy. But from this Howard government there is more good news on health.The March quarter GP bulk-billing rate was 73.7 per cent, and that is a 7.2 per cent increase on December 2003. For children under 16, 80.7 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed, and that is a 12.9 per cent increase on December 2003. Labor denies a tax cut for people over 65 but because of the Howard government 84.5 per cent of GP consultations for people over 65 are bulk-billed. That is a 10.5 per cent increase since December 2003. The bulk-billing rate in country areas is up 14.3 per cent since December 2003 and, as I said, 18.4 per cent in Tasmania.Bulk-billing is certainly not the be-all and end-all of Medicare but it is important; it should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners. That is precisely what is happening under the Howard government, and that is why the Howard government is still the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - It is the case that, in November 2004, Mick Palmer took up an appointment with the Department of Transport and Regional Services as the Inspector of Transport Security. The inspector was to investigate transport security matters referred by me, and they would include such things as major transport security incidents, patterns or series of incidents that might point to a systemic failure or other possible weaknesses of aviation or maritime security problems. As a result of his initial recommendations, I might note, we have determined that we ought to put in place a legislative basis to support the inspector, particularly in the protection of information for no-blame investigation. But I reiterate the answer that I gave a moment ago: he is on a temporary assignment elsewhere. I do not see that going for very long and, in the meantime, the Office of Transport Security is fully capable of undertaking any necessary inquiries on my or the government's behalf.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and acknowledge his very keen interest in the growing relationship between Australia and China, particularly on the economic front. This morning in Sydney, I participated in a forum with the visiting Chairman of the National People's Congress, Chairman Wu Bangguo, who is visiting Australia at the moment. Together we announced that today the first round of discussions with regard to the free trade agreement negotiations with China has begun in Sydney.The economic relationship between China and Australia has grown dramatically in recent years, to the extent where two-way trade at the moment stands at about $A29 billion. It is not just through exports out of the resources and minerals sector; it is also through the efforts of the banking and financial services sector, tourism, education and agriculture. Of course, these are all sectors that will benefit from the successful conclusion of a free trade agreement with China. The feasibility study that the government undertook into an FTA with China indicated that over the next 10 years it could be worth $24.4 billion to the economy. It is certainly worth pursuing. The rate of growth in China is having a profound impact on the global economy as well as our regional economy and the Australian economy. Of course, we want to take advantage of that and be able to consolidate our position in that market.We need to position the Australian economy well to take advantage of the growth in the global economy with our traditional trading partners but also with our major trading partners within the region. Our government has taken some hard decisions over recent years with regard to reform of the Australian economy. That has provided exporters with a very solid foundation to tackle global marketplaces. The challenge now for this country is to embrace new reforms in the industrial relations system so that we can boost productivity further and increase our competitive nature. Obviously, our government is absolutely focused on achieving this. The only thing that stands in the way is the Australian Labor Party, which is opposing these reforms and many other reforms. This is a challenge for the business community, as we heard the minister for workplace relations lay out. The business community is challenging the Labor Party to get out of the way.We need to increase productivity in this country. We need to increase our competitiveness so that we can take up the challenges of the growth that is taking place in the global economy, with the integration particularly of the Chinese economy with the broader global economy. It is a challenge that we are taking up on the trade front. We have taken it up in terms of reform of the Australian economy. We now need to tackle the challenge of reforming the industrial relations system in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. Yes, I did see those reports. I can inform the member and the House that, last week or late the week before last, I wrote to the assistant defence minister, asking her to provide me with a current assessment of recruiting and retention levels in the armed forces.I think it is fair to say that the current retention levels are broadly in line with the long-term average of the past 10 or 15 years. It is also true to say that, because of the strength of the economy and the well-rewarded employment alternatives that are available, it is correspondingly harder to retain and recruit the kinds of people we want. It is also the case, as the honourable member will know from his shadow portfolio responsibilities, that remuneration levels are set by an independent body. It is also the case that, when this government came to office, the one area that was absolutely quarantined from any budget cuts - in order to get rid of the $10½ billion deficit left to us by your leader - was Defence. There have been significant increases in the government's provision for Defence over the 9½ years it has been in government.I have to say that my experience and that of the defence minister and, indeed, of many others is that the enthusiasm and commitment of the men and women of the Defence Force remain at a very high level. We do need to understand that, in a very strong economy, we have to ensure that pay levels are adequate to retain sufficient people. I think it would be a mistake to infer, on the basis of one article in a newspaper, that everything contained in that article is correct, because it manifestly is not. Certainly, based on the advice I have and my own assessment, I do not find the depiction in that article as representative of the attitude of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. But I can assure the honourable member that this government will continue in the future, as it has done in the past, to provide all the financial support that the defence forces need - and, if further enhancements are needed, they will be provided.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. It is well known that state governments own, operate, administer and primarily fund state schools and that the Commonwealth government assists the state governments in doing that. The federal government - the Howard government - had already committed $1½ billion for capital works in schools over the next four years. In addition to that, the Prime Minister announced during the election campaign that an additional $1 billion will be invested directly in Australian schools, with $700 million of it to go directly to government state schools.As the member for Hasluck knows only too well, the Gosnells Primary School, which is in his electorate and is celebrating its centenary year, has toilets that are only marginally younger. For 20 years the Gosnells Primary School has been second on the list with the Western Australian Department of Education and Training - second on the list for 20 years - to have a toilet upgrade. The member for Forde will know that the Loganlea State School is desperately trying to get some shadecloth for the school. The member for Hume knows that the Bowral Primary School desperately needs some heating and sewerage work as well as a whole range of major projects which parents strongly support and will now receive.This government will provide capital works funding directly to Australian public state schools. Parent organisations and principals have to sign off on the projects. Up to $150,000 will be provided directly to the schools for projects that the parents believe are critically important in those schools. I noticed yesterday, in the Sun-Herald, that parent groups in the state of New South Wales have welcomed this funding. The article was headed 'Federal money to save our schools' and said:Sharryn Brownlee, president of the NSW Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations, said parents, frustrated by the long wait for funds from the State Government, were taking advantage of the Coalition's program.She described it as a lifeline.One thing I would say to the states is that I am deeply disturbed by what Queensland members have told me: that the Queensland government, through its political operatives in the education department, is telling school principals in that state that, if they cooperate with this initiative of money going directly into parents' projects in schools, it will be 'a career-ending move'. That is the kind of crippling, ideological bureaucracy that parents have had a gutful of putting up with. This government is determined to break through the educationally constipated bureaucracy at a state level.</DOC>

 - I welcome the fact that, for the first time in a very long time, we at last have a question from the opposition that has something to do with rural Australia. The drought that has been going for three to four years has finally dawned on the Leader of the Opposition, so welcome to the world. The reality is that the government have done more than any other to reform exceptional circumstances assistance, and we would have done a lot more if we could have had a bit of cooperation from the Labor states, most of which are now walking away entirely from drought assistance. The Victorian government are a classic example. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to show some compassion to farmers, I suggest that he first calls some of his state colleagues and asks the Victorian government why they terminated all of their drought assistance the moment their state election was over. Why did they cancel their assistance as soon as their state election was over? Why have Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia reduced their efforts?The reality is that we have sought to make significant reforms to the system, but we have had little or no cooperation from the states. In spite of that lack of cooperation, we have acted unilaterally to significantly improve the support available to farmers. We have done that by allowing such things as predictive modelling, so that declarations can be made earlier. We have changed the arrangements of boundaries for areas so that people are not locked out just because they are on the wrong side of the line. We have provided more generous and timely assistance. When the states would not cooperate, we acted unilaterally to provide assistance in December 2002 so that farmers could get immediate assistance. Even though we have tried - and we are still trying - to develop a drought reform system in cooperation with the states that will deliver meaningful assistance in a timely way, when the states have not cooperated we have still gone ahead, done our share and worked very hard with Australian farmers.As I have said on a number of occasions, and as the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister indicated in western New South Wales just a few days ago, we will stand by farmers during these tough times. We know it is difficult. We know that they are enduring perhaps the worst drought in our nation's history. We have demonstrated through the commitments we have already made that we will help farmers. We are prepared to do more, and we are working with industry organisations to achieve the very best possible results even when we cannot get cooperation from Labor states.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for the interest she shows in what is happening in Bougainville and in Papua New Guinea more generally. Over this period - that is, since last Friday until 2 June - elections are taking place in Bougainville to elect an autonomous Bougainville government. The House should be aware that these elections are a momentous occasion in the history of Bougainville and more generally Papua New Guinea. The elections are particularly significant when one bears in mind the bloodshed caused in Papua New Guinea by a civil war over a significant period of time.Around 130,000 people have registered to vote in Bougainville. This is a clear demonstration of the success of the peace process that has taken place there. I want to congratulate the government of Papua New Guinea, the leaders of Bougainville and the people of Bougainville on what they have done to take the peace process forward.In answer to the honourable member's question, I can say that we have had direct involvement in the elections in this one respect: we are participating in the United Nations-coordinated election observer mission on Bougainville, and we have provided $1 million to help with the election preparations. More importantly, it should not be forgotten that the government played a key role in bringing to an end the civil war in Bougainville and in facilitating the peace process. The Australian and the New Zealand governments were particularly important in assisting Papua New Guinea to bring peace to Bougainville following the Sandline crisis. This is one of the great achievements of Australia in recent years.Let me conclude by saying that, since 1997, the Australian government has provided more than $180 million in assistance to support the peace process and post-conflict reconstruction on Bougainville, and many Australians have worked in the Bougainville Peace Monitoring Group and other, related organisations. We strongly support the election process and are committed to ensuring there is lasting peace and development in Bougainville.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is also no. I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that there is already in the government's policy, and has been for some time, provision for children to live outside of detention with their mothers. That has been the case now - and I will stand corrected on this - for some two to three years. Not every family faced with the option of the mother and the child or children living in the community chooses to separate themselves from the male parent in that family, and that, of course, is their decision.Let me take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that the government continues to adhere to a policy of mandatory detention. It has been a central element of policy in this country from both sides of politics. We have already taken steps in relation to children. The decision taken last night, so I am advised, was a decision that was taken by the immigration department in its inherent administration of the immigration policy.I want to take this opportunity of expressing my very strong support for Senator Vanstone's administration of that portfolio. I express my very strong support for Amanda Vanstone's administration of what is a very difficult portfolio. The Australian people have not forgotten the flip-flopping and the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition on border protection and immigration policy. I believe that the minister is administering this policy in a sensible and flexible fashion. She is trying to achieve the balance between compassion in appropriate cases and the maintenance of a very strong border protection and immigration policy underpinned by mandatory detention, which, I understand, remains the formal policy of the opposition - although it suits the opposition when the occasion strikes it to pretend in a narrowcast way to a section of the Australian community that it no longer supports mandatory detention. The minister will continue to administer a highly successful policy in a sensitive and compassionate manner.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I can tell him that this side of the House support tax cuts for all Australians commencing on 1 July this year. In particular, we will do that by cutting the 17 per cent marginal rate to 15 per cent. I made the point yesterday that the Labor Party opposes that and that it opposes any tax cut on 1 July. The member for Lilley took great objection to that and he scurried around and produced one of his press releases, which I, at least, read - I do not want those press releases to feel entirely lonely and orphaned! He took great objection to this. He said, 'Oh, that's not right. Labor's proposal would see tax cuts on 1 July 2005.' Do you know what they were? They were the government's tax cuts from the last budget. I might have missed the last election, but I thought the Labor Party went to the last election saying that they were no good because they did not apply to people on under $52,000. Now they are an integral part of the Labor Party's tax policy.The second thing he said was that Labor's plan gives you a $12 tax cut on 1 January 2006. As I said yesterday, if you are on $20,000, you do not get a $12-a-week tax cut. Of course you do not get a $12-a-week tax cut on $20,000. Again, it was completely false. The third thing he said - and get a load of this - was that senior Australians would benefit from Labor's tax plan. I said yesterday that, because Labor are against cutting the lowest marginal rate, senior Australians would not get the benefit. The member for Lilley went out and said, 'No, no, they will. Senior Australians will get the benefit because' - and get a load of this - 'senior Australians will be eligible for Labor's welfare to work bonus.' Can't you see the Leader of the Opposition going through old age homes and, when people ask him, 'Where's my tax cut?' him saying, 'Well, if you only move off welfare into work, madam, you will be eligible for Labor's welfare to work bonus'? This was a tax policy cobbled together out of nothing to try to relieve the Leader of the Opposition's self-inflicted wounds. It changes on a daily basis.That bill implementing the tax cuts will go through this parliament. If it does not go through this Senate, it will go through the Senate that takes its place on 1 July. The bill will be dated to take effect from 1 July. It will become law, even if it has to be passed by the new Senate; but, in order for people to get their tax cuts on 1 July, the withholding schedules, which have been prepared by the Commissioner of Taxation, must clear both houses of this parliament. Either house can disallow those withholding schedules. If the Senate should disallow the withholding schedules, that means that employers cannot operate the new withholding schedules from 1 July and people will not get their tax cut on 1 July.The critical question for the Leader of the Opposition now becomes: will he be disallowing those withholding schedules, which will be tabled in the Senate when the Senate sits in about 2½ weeks time? Will he be disallowing them and throwing 850,000 businesses into confusion, denying people their tax cut, or will he allow those withholding schedules to go through? According to AAP the Labor caucus discussed this issue in their meeting. Bear in mind that the Labor Party is taking this great stand against tax cuts so that the Leader of the Opposition can show how strong he is on the issue. Here is the AAP report on what the caucus intends to do about the withholding schedules:A party spokeswoman said that the Labor Party would oppose the bill - that is, the tax cuts - in the House of Representatives and the Senate. But it will not make a decision on disallowing proposed tax schedules. 'We have determined through caucus today to not determine a position on the disallowance.This is the resolute Australian Labor Party: 'We have resolutely determined today not to determine a position on this particular issue'! There are 850,000 businesses in Australia that need to know what to do on 1 July. I call on the Labor Party to determine to determine to have a determined position, determinately in favour of tax cuts! Get out of the way and let the tax cuts through.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the contents of Cornelia Rau's news conference yesterday. I have read reports of it. I did not see it, although I saw some excerpts from it on television last night. Clearly, the lady has been through a very difficult experience. I have acknowledged that repeatedly; spokesmen on behalf of the government and others have acknowledged that repeatedly. We do have an inquiry process underway. I can repeat what I have said before that, until the Palmer inquiry has reported, it is not the government's intention to contemplate other things. When we have the report of the Palmer inquiry in, we can then assess all of the circumstances and give further attention to what might be done. At this stage, beyond repeating my previous expressions regarding this lady's treatment, I do not intend to add anything. I think the sensible, measured, right thing to do - a thing that I suggest any government looking at this matter seriously would do - is to act as we have said.In relation to Vivian Alvarez, I would like to take the opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about her, to repeat that the circumstances of that have been referred to Mr Palmer for inquiry and report. He has publicly indicated how he is going to handle that. In the meantime, as I think the Leader of the Opposition knows, a very experienced Centrelink officer from Darwin has been sent to the Philippines to talk to Vivian Alvarez and offer her assistance on behalf of the government. That person will have communicated the following offers of assistance immediately available to Vivian Alvarez: payment of her airfare and return airfares for an accompanying relative and/or nurse or carer, as assessed as appropriate in Manila; assistance from a reputable and experienced community agency to provide reception arrangements; accommodation and out-of-pocket expenses and assistance with finding and settling into longer term accommodation; the provision of a case manager to ensure that she has regular and ongoing access to advice and counselling as required; ensuring she is appropriately linked to other services, including income support, assistance, rent assistance, Medicare and counselling; and assessment for and arrangements to access medical and rehabilitation services, including the meeting of appropriate costs. That is what has been offered at present. Of course the lady is free to return to Australia. The question of when she returns and if any conditions are attached -  -  - Let me say this again: if any preconditions are attached to her return to Australia, they will be preconditions of her choosing, not of the government's. The government have made it perfectly clear that we will do everything proper to facilitate, assist and support Ms Alvarez's return to Australia. We are offering these things and, when we have further advice from Mr Palmer about the circumstances of her detention, depending on that advice we will have something further to say. I understand the keenness of the opposition to attack the government over this - oppositions do that. I simply want to say that it is a very unfortunate situation. Something plainly has gone wrong, but until we have available the report of Mr Palmer I am not going to start prejudging the situation. I simply say again that the minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, continues to enjoy my very strong support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I can inform him that if the withholding schedules are not disallowed by the Australian Labor Party then every Australian can have a tax cut on 1 July 2005 - which is great news. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is determined not to determine its position in relation to those withholding schedules. But business in Australia has no doubt what the Australian Labor Party should do. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:... the red-tape problems small business had been dreading in relation to the failure of the Senate to pass the tax cuts have come to pass.At least 850,000 employers are tangled up in this mess.This is Labor playing with the businesses of 850,000 hardworking Australian business owners. Heather Ridout from the Australian Industry Group said:This is ultimately just a political move by Labor ... Business is already facing an inordinate compliance burden and this is just going to add to it ...Mark Bethwaite of Australian Business Ltd said that the opposition has:... made its political point.Now business wants it to do the right thing by Australia and end the confusion.Those 850,000 businesses want to end the confusion. Harry Quick, the member for Franklin, said:There was a fair bit of angst there, let's be honest. Why should we delay them getting the six bucks?'According to ABC radio, we had Clare Martin instructing her senators to allow these schedules through. Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, did not just support these tax cuts; he claimed he was responsible for them. He said:If we look at the tax cuts, which I think are excellent - and we have been advocating that for some time. They're essentially built off the back of the WA economy. The hard work of the West Australian people, the strength of our economy, has given Peter Costello the surplus he needs to deliver these tax cuts.Apparently nobody told his fellow Western Australian the member for Brand. Paul Lennon, the Premier of Tasmania, said in the Tasmanian parliament:... at the end of the day, the Tasmanian community wants the tax cuts delivered and had I been in the Federal Labor caucus I would have been advising them not to block the tax cuts.When asked if Labor should be rejecting tax cuts, Bob Carr, the New South Wales Premier, said:Listen, you'll have to go to federal Labor.So who is responsible for this great strategy to deny Australians their tax cuts on 1 July? The Sunday Telegraph of 15 May said:Swan and his close mate Stephen Smith were in the lock-up. So was another 'rooster' from the Mark Latham era, Stephen Conroy.Can't you just see them in the fetid air of the budget lockup, discussing their tactics? Mr Speaker, this was no budget lockup; this was a chicken coop. The roosters were sitting around discussing their strategy. I am not a gambling man but I have taken an interest in scratchies since the last election. For $2 you can buy a scratchie called 'the Lucky Rooster'. If you scratch three roosters, you can win $100,000.Government  members interjecting -  - Let me say to the Australian public: if we could scratch the three roosters, every Australian would get a tax cut on 1 July 2005, and that is what they deserve.</DOC>

 - It is because it is the perfect answer to the meretricious nonsense that the Treasurer has gone on with in the course of this question time. The simple fact of the matter is that if you accept our amendments seven million Australians will get $12 a week, not the derisory, contemptible $6 you have offered them while personally pocketing $65 a week. That is why: because we on this side of the House stand for a bit of tax justice for seven million Australians who, in the course of the last five years, with this alleged tax cut of yours you propose to give $10 while you award your backbench $120. We regard this as unacceptable for the Australian people. Those seven million Australians - those nurses, those truckies, those people on the waterfront and on the building sites - worked for the wealth of this country, and they deserve a decent tax cut. You have denied them that tax cut, and the moment that you give them that tax cut you will get your legislation. -  - If Labor's tax cuts go through in the next couple of weeks, average Australian families will find themselves in a situation where they are $1,800 better off if they happen to be dual income families, or nearly $1,000 better off if they happen to be single income families. They will be able to use those resources to pay for petrol, to pay for the rise in interest rates under this government, to pay for the various things they need - not your indulgences, their needs. That is what will happen if Labor's tax cuts go through. The Treasurer invites us to bow down and worship at his altar of a $6 tax cut when he has already presided over, as a result of the policy he pursued last year, an $8 a week rise for the average mortgagee. Minus $2 is what the Treasurer offers the average mortgagee in Western Sydney.So, Treasurer, you have some very simple options here. You want the Labor Party's support for your legislation. You can get it very easily. You can sacrifice that $24 billion you have decided to whack off the bottom line of your budget in order to pay for giant tax cuts for your backbench - both in their superannuation and in their income tax - to further your leadership ambitions. You can sacrifice that for the seven million people who put you there and whom you have treated with such arrogance, not only in this budget but also in previous budgets. But if you do not accept what we have to say, Mr Treasurer, perhaps we may shame you into a position where you never do this to ordinary middle-income taxpayers again. And we will fight to change your behaviour.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that Japan submitted plans to the scientific committee of the International Whaling Commission to expand its so-called scientific whaling program in the Southern Ocean. That plan would double its take of minke whales to 935 and for the first time include fin and humpback whales. The government strongly opposes all forms of commercial and scientific whaling. Let me make that absolutely clear. And we always have done. In all the time we have been in office we have opposed - and I think the previous government probably did too - this type of whaling; in fact, we have opposed all types of whaling. While stock numbers remain under threat it is clear that Japan's whaling program simply cannot be described as science. The Prime Minister made known Australia's opposition to Japan's plans during his recent visit to Japan and, more importantly, has written to Prime Minister Koizumi urging Japan to reconsider its proposal.On my instructions, our ambassador in Tokyo has also raised Australia's concern and our embassy in Tokyo is coordinating joint representations to the Japanese with other anti-whaling governments. Quite a few governments, I believe, will participate in this demarche. We will be working with anti-whaling nations at next month's International Whaling Commission meeting in Korea to urge Japan to cease altogether the scientific whaling program. Diplomacy and the force of argument are the best hope we have of being successful. The member for Griffith has suggested we use the leverage of our aid to a country like the Solomon Islands in order to get the Solomon Islands to change their position. - Indeed, I was, Mr Speaker. I make the point that I think it is quite wrong to use the excellent program we have in the Solomon Islands as leverage. In other words, that we would propose to cut out or cut some of the RAMSI program to rehabilitate the Solomon Islands. I do not think that is the right approach. Only Senator Brown agrees with the member for Griffith on this particular - </DOC>

 - There is distinction between the application of that legislation and the circumstances of the case. The reason why we have not intervened in the manner I think implied by the member for Grayndler is that the strong legal advice we have is that our claim over the waters off the Antarctic, which are the subject of our claim, is not recognised by Japan. It is not a claim that is recognised by a lot of other countries, and in those circumstances, on our advice, the sort of action sought would not be supported by international law.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to some very interesting statements made by the member for Grayndler in the House last night, to some made by the Leader of the Opposition, and then to some again made by the member for Grayndler. They call into question the seriousness of the commitment I thought the Leader of the Opposition had made last week when he went to Tasmania to support in full the agreement I signed with the Tasmanian Premier. The truth is that last night here in the parliament it was very clear from the speech made by the member for Grayndler - for whom the member for Lyons has a very endearing and memorable expression - that he did not regard the agreement that I signed with the Tasmanian Premier as going far enough. He in fact wanted us to go a great deal further. The member for Lyons no doubt would have listened to that speech with a great deal of interest, because, unlike the member for Grayndler, the member for Lyons does have an interest in the jobs of hardworking Tasmanians.It was quite clear from the speech made by the member for Grayndler last night that he was in conflict with what I thought had been the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in Tasmania last week. But this morning at a doorstop the Leader of the Opposition seemed to me to be endeavouring to back away a bit from what he had said last week. Instead of expressing fulsome support, he was talking about a glass being only half full. In other words, he was walking both sides of the street. On the one hand, last week in Tasmania, surrounded by all those timber workers, he supported the agreement. But that all changes when a bit of heat is put on him by the member for Grayndler - fancy allowing the member for Grayndler to corner you on a policy issue. The Leader of the Opposition has answered a lot of questions today, and I have one more question for him so he can clear this matter up. At the end of question time today he can get up and very simply tell the House whether or not, if Labor were to win the next election, it would be the intention of a Beazley Labor government to renegotiate in any way the agreement that I signed with the Tasmanian Premier.</DOC>

 - As I think the member for Griffith would understand on an issue like this, when we are dealing with a nation that is a close friend of Australia and that is very important to Australia for a whole variety of reasons, one does not jump to the next move that one might consider making without having exhausted other moves. The sensible thing for this government to do, and what the government intends to do, is to continue to pursue a diplomatic path. You never completely rule things out but, I have to say, taking legal action against Japan in the International Court of Justice would be a very significant thing to do.We will continue to pursue the diplomatic path. That diplomatic path also involves, of course, taking the matter to the International Whaling Commission and arguing our case there. It is not, I believe, productive for this country to adopt an arm's length belligerence towards Japan. It makes no sense. It is not more likely to get a result. It is far more likely to get a result if we pursue the matter in a diplomatic fashion. And if, on the basis of those results, we believe that some further action is necessary then we will give consideration to it. I think the action that is currently being taken is the right action.</DOC>

 - Since some remarks were made by the member for Perth yesterday, I have had a bit of further research done on the issue of workplace relations reform. It is very revealing research. For example, on 17 June 1996, the Leader of the Opposition said:... the government is attacking the very basis of people's living standards ... Attack wages, and you attack families.On 8 October 1996, Senator Faulkner, the then Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, said:In my view, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill signals the end of cooperative industrial relations as we know it today.The member for Batman, not to be forgotten, said:I rise to speak on the workplace relations bill, which I strongly believe threatens the very fabric of our society.Senator Kate Lundy, on 6 November 1996, said:... what the bill really means is much lower pay without extra jobs.The member for Jagajaga, on 21 November 1996, said:There is no question that the workplace relations act, when it is finally brought into play, will make the work environment much harder for women.And, of course, the most comprehensive of all were the remarks of the member for Perth, when he said this on 17 October 1995, before the government came to office:The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards.They were the predictions made nine years ago about our then industrial relations reform. Fast-forward to today, Mr Speaker, and have a look at what has happened. Real wages have risen by 14 per cent versus 1.2 per cent. Unemployment is at a 30-year low. The profit share is at a historical high. The strength of the Australian economy is the envy of the industrialised world. The living standards of Australian workers have never been higher than they are under the policies that those opposite predicted nine years ago were going to destroy the fabric of our society.I remind the Australian public of those predictions, because undoubtedly, when we release our reforms in the next few days, the same predictions will be made. They will be just as false; they will be just as exaggerated; they will be based on scaremongering and not on fact; and they will be proved by the passage of time to be the complete falsehood and deception of the Australian people that the arguments of nine years ago were. Those opposite have been found to be political fraudsters at the bar of public opinion over the last nine years, as they will be over the years ahead.</DOC>

I accept that that comment was made as asserted by the member for Kingsford Smith. But that does not alter in any way the basis of the answer I have previously given.

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. It is always a pleasure to visit his electorate and to meet with constituents who have benefited from the 14 per cent increase in real wages that has occurred under this government.There are few certainties in Australian politics, but one of them is that any mention of workplace relations changes by this side of parliament will lead to a hysterical scare campaign by the Labor Party. As the Prime Minister indicated in his earlier remarks, in 1996 we had a litany of stories, a litany of remarks, from the Labor Party about the Workplace Relations Act, an act which has led to a 14 per cent increase in real wages for Australians compared to just a 1.2 per cent increase under 13 years of Labor Party government. We have the Labor Party at it again straight away. Yesterday the member for Perth claimed:... so far as they impact on Australian employees and their families, they will have the effect of reducing their wages, stripping their entitlements and removing their safety nets.One thing about the member for Perth is that he likes to be on message. - The problem is that he has been on the same wrong message -  - for the last 10 years. We had the Leader of the Opposition out saying the same thing again. Could I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition said in 1996 that the Workplace Relations Act was 'attacking the very basis of people's living standards'. And what did he say just last week? He said that the government's objective with industrial relations is not reform but suppression of wages. What we are getting is the same old, sad litany of tales from the opposition. They are saying the things that they said in 1995 and 1996. They were wrong in 1995 and 1996, and they will be wrong in 2005 and 2006.</DOC>

 - The member is quite right. I heard his speech the other day and I will refer to that shortly. It is correct to say that we are going to commemorate victory in the Pacific. We on this side of the House respect our veterans and 60 years after the Second World War we want to pay tribute to their tremendous contribution to this nation's freedom and democracy.I sent out a letter to all members of parliament that encourages local members to work with their community and ex-service groups to prepare a proposal to commemorate victory in the Pacific in August. As the letter says, the detailed guidelines will follow. They are presently with the minister for finance and he is going to check off on them. As my letter says, I will be making them available to all members of parliament. However, I am interested in the comments of the member for Oxley yesterday. He claims that he had insufficient information and could not proceed. But he has an article in the Queensland Times titled 'VP Day party fund'. It says:Community groups are being encouraged to apply for funding to hold activities to celebrate the 60th anniversary of victory in the Pacific. The federal electorate of Oxley has been allocated $10,000 of $1.5 million to be eligible if projects need to promote community participation, give recognition to World War II veterans and heighten public awareness.I notice this has not held the member for Oxley back at all. I am pleased to see that he, like every other member of parliament, is seeking advice from his ex-service organisations to make sure this commemoration is memorable. This is another attempt by the Labor Party to denigrate our commemorations program for our veterans. - For the second time, if the Labor Party is sensitive, I withdraw. - I withdraw unconditionally. However, I would simply like to refer to an article about the Gallipoli commemoration from a young man in the electorate of Parkes, Andrew Hetherington. With regard to Gallipoli, which as you will recall was the subject of some criticism, he said -  - As I said, the member for Oxley has promoted this in his electorate, as I trust other members will. The guidelines will be available very shortly, as the letter says. I trust that it will be as successful as the Gallipoli commemorations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I appreciate his efforts,  both as a general practitioner in Perth and as a public health advocate, to reduce the rate of smoking in Australia. Smoking is one of the greatest avoidable causes of early death and chronic disease. This government has already spent some $24 million on antismoking campaigns. We will shortly be introducing graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. Thanks to the good work of health educators, supported by government policy, Australia's smoking rate has fallen from 22 per cent in 1998 to just 17 per cent today. It is the lowest on record and it is one of the lowest in the world. But it is still too high, especially amongst young people. About one-third of 16- to 17-year-olds smoke. I am afraid to say that about half of those people who begin to smoke during adolescence will ultimately die of a smoking related disease.I am pleased to say that in the recent budget the government committed an additional $25 million over four years for further antismoking campaigns targeting young people and some $4 million to try to reduce the incidence of smoking during pregnancy. These are further judicious investments by the Howard government in health care and disease prevention. When this government sees a problem, it acts to address the problem. We never go around determined not to determine a position. We never go around decided to be undecided. We never go around, like the Leader of the Opposition, resolved to be irresolute. All powerful to be impotent! - No. - If the member for Grayndler does not recall, I was actually quoting some statements from Winston Churchill. Back in 1938 in the House of Commons he said of the then government's indecision and irresolution that they went on in strange paradox, above all else, 'All powerful to be impotent.' - I am happy to address members opposite. Unlike members opposite, this government is capable of making a decision and this government is capable of making judicious investments in the health care of the Australian people, which is why the people of Australia trust the Howard government with their health care. They know that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - In relation to the first part of the question, this government provides record funding for schools. Where the government has made a significant investment of hard-earned taxpayers' money in a schools program it makes no apology whatsoever for requiring that a government representative officiate at that opening. - Secondly, the government makes no apology, also, for requiring that as a condition of school funding the Australian flag will be flown at every Australian school. - In relation specifically to the question of an apology to the member for Cowan, the answer is no.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Everyone on this side, including the member for La Trobe, believes in three things in schooling: national consistency, national high quality and choice in education - choosing to send your child to a Catholic, independent or government school. The government in the budget this year has increased funding to Australian schools by $8½ billion. That is an eight per cent increase for government schools and a seven per cent increase for Catholic and independent schools. In fact this year this government has increased funding for capital works in Australian schools by a staggering 29 per cent in one year. It is worth reflecting on the fact that, had the Labor Party won the election last year, the funding increase for Catholic and independent schools after the Labor Party had taken government would not have been seven per cent - it would have been 3½ per cent.I am asked about other policies. It is well known that the Australian Labor Party went to last year's election led by Mr Latham arguing that it would take money from Australian parents and their children who make sacrifices to send their kids to Catholic and independent schools. One hundred and seventy-eight Australian schools, Catholic and independent, were to have their funding cut or frozen, taking $520 million out of those schools over a four-year period. That was the policy the Labor Party took to the election, and no doubt we will be reminded of that in the inaugural Latham lecture.I notice the Labor Party has been getting some advice on the policy. On 27 April this year the Australian newspaper reported a speech by Mr Bill Shorten, President of the Australian Workers Union. It says:On education, Mr Shorten slammed the ALP's policy under failed leader Mark Latham for taking money away from ... private schools, saying Bob Hawke 'would have thrown out this silly idea in a few seconds'.I then noticed that in the Melbourne Age on 19 May the Victorian Premier, Mr Steve Bracks, has also given some advice to the Labor Party federally. It says:Premier Steve Bracks has urged the federal ALP to scrap its contentious 'hit list' of private schools that would suffer funding cuts under a federal Labor government.I notice in the story that it then says:In response to Mr Bracks' comments yesterday, federal Labor's education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, said the party was sticking with the policy approach.In other words, the Labor Party is committed to a policy that says to the parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools that a Labor government will remove funding that supports the education of their children. It needs to be remembered in this place that the Labor Party's determination to stop Australian working families from getting a tax cut is matched only by its determination to cut the funding for the education of their children. So long as the member for La Trobe remains in the seat that he is in, and every member on this side, this government will protect and defend choice in Australian education and the rights of parents to make sacrifices for their children.</DOC>

 - Can I simply say that I have spent the last nine or more years look-ing a lot of Australian workers very directly in the eye. I have had my share of encourag-ing responses and my share of rebukes. I will go on, as has been my wont over the last 9¼ years, meeting as many Australians as I can, looking them in the face and explaining policies. When I talk to Australian workers and to the seven million Australians to whom the member has referred, I tell them of the 14 per cent increase in their real wages, I tell them of the fact that unemployment is at a 30-year low, I tell them that they are saving $500 a month on average on their mortgage and I tell them that the opportunities for their young sons and daughters to get jobs is much greater than it was 10 years ago. I remind them of the benefits they have had out of the tax changes that we have undertaken. I remind them, as I take the liberty of reminding the member who asked me the question, that if you aggregate all of the personal income tax cuts that have occurred under this government, you would find that the greatest percentage reductions have been given to the lowest income earners, which makes an absolute nonsense of this.The final piece of advice I would give to the member who asked me that question is that she ought to go out in her own electorate and honestly look that same representative sample of seven million Australians in the eye and ask them the question: do they feel better or worse off under this government? If she is honest with herself and honest with this House, she will acknowledge that they will say that they are better off under this government and that this government has been a better friend of the workers of the Hunter Valley than any previous Labor government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. Last week in Sydney I co-chaired the ninth Joint Ministerial Committee meeting with my ministerial counterpart from India, Minister Kamal Nath, where we focused on the bilateral relationship between Australia and India. India, a country with a population of 1.1 billion people, 1.1 billion consumers, has an economy that is growing rapidly, almost as quickly as China's, as is our trading relationship with India. At the moment that trading relationship consumes about $6 billion worth of Australia's exports.We agreed last week that we would develop and negotiate a trade and economic framework between Australia and India to take advantage of the many bilateral agreements that are in place between Australia and India now such as the Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement, the Double Taxation Agreement and many others. That trade and economic framework will take our commercial relationship with India to a new level and take advantage of the already strong trading relationship with India and also the growing disposable income that 1.1 billion Indians have in that growth economy.I also note the rare occasions when we get support from the opposition on some of our policies, and we have support from the opposition on our free trade agreement negotiations with China. I thank the opposition spokesman on trade for that and urge him and the Labor Party to also support the position we are taking with enhancing and deepening the relationship with India.The member for Hotham has been quite courageous in taking on the left-wing elements of the industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party so that he can argue good policy in negotiating an FTA with China. He should have been there when we were negotiating with the United States. I am sure he will support us as we negotiate with India. But the challenge is going to be for the Leader of the Opposition to get in and protect him against some of the thugs in the Victorian industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party. If we look at the meetings that took place over the weekend and some of the reporting of what the member for Hotham was subjected to because he took a principled stance on good policy, the Leader of the Opposition should get in and protect him in his seat. Some of the lesser elements of the Labor Party were said to say:Crean's federal Labor days are numbered, says a senior party figure ...At least the member for Hotham can see good policy when it is put in front of him and supports the government in what it is trying to do for Australia. The challenge is for the Leader of the Opposition to protect and look after the interests of the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan for his question, but I must say he demeans himself by putting a false assertion in the question. Firstly, the parliamentary secretary for education is doing an outstanding job in that role. One of his responsibilities is to oversee the national flagpoles program. I advise the House, as I did yesterday, that two years ago the Australian government recognised that not all Australian schools had a functioning flagpole. The government requires as a condition of funding that all Australian schools will fly the Australian flag. Quite reasonably, the Australian government said it would make funding available for the replacement of a non-functioning flagpole or to have one placed where one did not exist.Since then, the Australian government has invested $803,000 in 1,670 flagpoles in Australian schools. The guidelines for capital works from which this is now being funded require, quite reasonably, that an Australian government representative be formally invited to officiate at the commissioning of a flagpole in an Australian school. Under no circumstances do those guidelines state that it precludes an invitation to any other member of the parliament or any representative of any community organisation.The member for Cowan alleges that he was refused an invitation to the commissioning of a flagpole at a school in his electorate. I can find no evidence at all to support that, but, if that were the case, I would join him in being outraged because under no circumstances does the Australian government believe that the commissioning of flagpoles in Australian schools should preclude an invitation being offered by the school to any other member of parliament. If the school believes that a member of parliament should be invited to speak then the member should be invited to do so, but an Australian government representative will officiate at the commissioning of such a flagpole.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I know he has a great interest in the Pacific and I appreciate his concern. This government has shown a real passion for addressing the problems of the Pacific. Bougainville is going through a period of elections for a provincial government. This comes out of a peace agreement that the Australian government played a key part in making possible. We have helped to rebuild Fiji politically after the coup of 2000 and, without any doubt, we made a very valuable contribution there. We have been working to assist the Papua New Guinean government with its reform programs and, although suffering a setback as a result of the Supreme Court decision on the Enhanced Cooperation Program, I look forward to welcoming Sir Rabbie Namaliu, the foreign minister, and Bire Kimisopa, the police minister, here in Canberra tomorrow to talk through how we will solve this problem. Let me also mention that in 2003 we deployed the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. This mission has done a great job in helping to reform and rebuild the Solomon Islands and, amongst other things, to bring to justice many criminals, including Harold Keke. This is an example of the excellent work that the government has been doing in the Pacific.Are there any alternative views? We do not believe on our side of the House that the aid program to Pacific countries should be cut in support of some position they may take in an international meeting. The Labor Party has made it clear that it believes that aid to the Solomon Islands should be threatened on the basis of how the Solomon Islands would vote in the International Whaling Commission. The member for Griffith, for example, is reported in the Sun-Herald of 22 May as saying that we should use our aid to lean on countries such as the Solomon Islands to influence their voting in the International Whaling Commission. The member for Grayndler - who calls out, 'Where?' - said on 2UE yesterday, in answer to a question about this, 'We're prepared to link a whole range of issues.' This policy, by the way, has received the endorsement of the Greens, of Senator Brown, who said:I think we need a much tougher line to take there. Kevin Rudd is right.We do not believe that the Regional Assistance Mission in the Solomon Islands should in any way be threatened over this issue. We believe the right way to approach it is through decisive and strong diplomacy and endeavouring to persuade the Japanese government to protect whales and to not proceed with their so-called scientific whaling. But as for our threatening the aid programs of countries in the Pacific, no, we will not do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I can inform the House that the OECD released its Economic Outlook overnight, in which it provided assessments of developed economies around the world and of the global economic situation. The OECD report about Australia was extremely positive. The OECD expects economic growth to strengthen, with low unemployment and inflation contained within our two per cent to three per cent target band. The OECD notes that high company profitability, low corporate debt and buoyant business confidence are expected to support further improvement in business investment. The OECD expects that strengthening exports will narrow the current account deficit and the OECD believes that the unemployment rate, which is now at 28-year lows, will continue well below the average unemployment rate of the developed world, which is 6.7 per cent. The OECD also notes that Australia projects a surplus in its Commonwealth budget over the next two years, in contrast to the rest of the developed world, which is projecting deficits of the order of three per cent over those two years.This assessment is particularly striking when it is compared to that of other countries in the OECD. In fact, a chief economist of the OECD, Vincent Koen, was interviewed on ABC Radio National today. He was asked by the interviewer to name some areas where Australia should be improving, and he said this:I am a bit ill at ease here because Australia in many ways has outperformed all of Europe, where I am speaking from right now. So this is listing recommendations to an economy that has already done much better in recent years.If you heard that interview this morning you would have heard that he sounded ill at ease too, giving advice on the Australian economy.But, having said that, economic performances can always be improved and the OECD has recommended that Australia focus on the following: 'making wage bargaining more flexible' - this side of the House would agree with that; 'creating stronger incentives to labour market participation' - that is what our welfare-to-work reforms are all about; 'removing disincentives to hiring' - these are the unfair dismissal laws which the Australian Labor Party has now blocked 42 times in the Australian Senate; 'improving training and education' - what this government is all about; and 'promoting competitive pressures in the economy'.It is true that Australia's economic performance has outperformed the developed world over recent years, but that does not mean we can stop. What we have to do is improve our performance in all of those areas. The most important thing that the Australian Labor Party can do to help Australia's economic performance is to get out of the way and let the government get on with promoting a competitive economy and reforming the labour market, unfair dismissal laws, welfare-to-work laws, education and training. The biggest obstacle to economic reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party and its leader. I call on the Australian Labor Party to support this government's changes to industrial relations - momentous changes which will be released later this week.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the member for Reid that I have a great deal of respect for both the member for Kooyong and the member for Pearce. Each of them has made a very impressive contribution to the deliberations of this party. They have expressed views on a particular policy issue, as they are entitled to do inside a democratic party. The government's policy on mandatory detention, its policy of returning boats, its policy of cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and also its use of offshore processing facilities have all combined together to end Australia as a destination for illegal immigration and for people-smuggling. It remains the policy of this government to keep a policy of mandatory detention. That policy, as has been demonstrated by the announcements made some two months ago by the minister for immigration, will continue to be one where opportunities to administer it in a flexible and more compassionate way will be taken advantage of. That is an ongoing process. It is not something that is regarded as having been completed.I remind the House, as I have been asked a question on this issue, that it is my understanding that at present some 1,004 people are in detention. Something in the order of 300 of those people have been in detention for more than 12 months. Quite a number of those people still have certain legal processes to be exhausted. Some of them are people whose applications for refugee status have not been successful but, for a combination of reasons, it is not practicable to return them to the countries from whence they came. It is at that group that the measures announced by the minister for immigration some two months ago were directed. Cases and people falling within that group continue to receive the attention of the department of immigration.I was asked about my view of the minister for immigration. She continues to enjoy my strong support. There are a number of issues that are now being investigated concerning the department of immigration. When Mr Palmer's report is to hand, the government will give further attention to those matters, but I can assure the House that opportunities on an ongoing basis will be taken to administer the policy of mandatory detention - which has been the policy of this government since it came to power and which will remain our policy and which was a policy introduced by the Keating government in 1992 - in the most flexible and compassionate way consistent with its maintenance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I acknowledge the interest that he and his constituents have in a more productive income tax system here in Australia. There is one side of this House that supports income tax cuts on 1 July: the Liberal and National parties, who want every Australian to have an income tax cut on 1 July. Unfortunately, there is another side of this House that wants nobody to have an income tax cut on 1 July and is opposing proposals to bring down the lowest rate of tax from 17c to 15c in the dollar and to increase the thresholds at which the higher marginal tax rates cut in.Let me make this point: the bill that will enact these tax cuts will be passed by the parliament. It may not be passed before 30 June, but it will be passed by the parliament, at the latest in August when the new Senate sits. However, for people to receive the tax cut that that bill provides, withholding schedules to be applied by employers must remain in place and not be disallowed before 30 June. I can inform the House that those withholding schedules will be introduced into the Senate on 14 June. If the Australian Labor Party, which knows that the tax cuts bill will go through, will give an assurance that it will not disallow those schedules, then every employee can have their tax cut on 1 July, whether the bill has gone through by 1 July or not. There is no reason to await the passage of the bill. The critical thing here is the withholding schedules. For every Australian to get their tax cut, the Australian Labor Party has to indicate that it will not move to disallow those withholding schedules when they are introduced on 14 June.Yesterday, the caucus spokeswoman said that the Labor Party had determined not to determine a position. They were being resolutely irresolute in relation to this matter. But not all of the members of the Labor Party feel that way. I can reveal, as reported in the Herald Sun today, that not all the members of the caucus feel that they should follow the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley with the charge of the Light Brigade - 'Half a league, half a league, half a league onward,' goes the Leader of the Opposition. The article said:A senior caucus member last night estimated up to a quarter of Labor MPs were unhappy about Mr Beazley's tax tactics.'And it's not just junior MPs, a lot of senior people have reservations about what's gone on,' the MP said.Some were unhappy about the lack of consultation - the tactic was decided upon during the Budget lock-up and it was never put to Caucus.Others were concerned that the public wanted the tax cuts and would see the ALP as spoilers.Why wouldn't the public see the ALP as spoilers? The ALP will not be able to defeat this tax cut. The only thing they can do is cause confusion for 850,000 Australian employers. This is no simple matter for 850,000 Australian employers. They have to load these schedules into their payroll systems. They have to be able, from 1 July, to know what the tax rates are going to be. Every business organisation in Australia is now condemning the ALP over this tactic, and they are right to do so. - Mr Speaker, if you wanted to know who was amongst the quarter of the ALP caucus opposed to the tactic, one of them just came to the dispatch box. - Here we have a political party which has no credibility with Australian business. Here we have a political party which is now engaged in confusing 850,000 employers about tax schedules which are to apply on 1 July, and here we have a frivolous interjection in the House of Representatives, to try to disguise from the people of Australia the fact that the Australian Labor Party stands in between them and their tax cut on 1 July. Let the Labor Party get out of the way; let the tax cuts come in; let Australians have what the budget promised them on 10 May.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for a question that goes in a very practical way to the heart of one of the difficulties facing this country in the area of training, and that is the inability of people who earn trade qualifications in some parts of the country to have full faith and credit given to those qualifications in other parts of the country. It is, for example - so I am advised - the case that a young person who has a hairdressing qualification from a private training organisation in Victoria cannot carry on his or her trade in New South Wales without completing a full apprenticeship. They can, by contrast, get employment and recognition in London as a hairdresser. A person can be working as a qualified carpenter in Canberra but if they want to work five kilometres away in Queanbeyan they have to get a licence from the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading, which may mean that they have to do another formal assessment and incur additional costs. In New South Wales a person can do a hospitality qualification which covers nationally agreed competencies for serving alcohol. They can use this qualification to work in Victoria but not in New South Wales, where they actually did the course. In New South Wales, they must undertake and pay for another course through the New South Wales Department of Gaming and Racing.Let me say immediately that these problems and anomalies have been in existence for a long time. I am not for a moment alleging that they are the exclusive creation of current Labor governments which are in power in all the states and territories; they are not. It does strike me as very strange in 2005 that we have for all practical purposes created a situation where if you qualify as a lawyer in Western Australia you can practise law in any other state but if you qualify as an electrician, a bartender or something else in one part of the country you cannot have full faith and credit given to those qualifications in other parts of the country. I have been in touch with the premiers and chief ministers and this is an issue that has been placed on the agenda for the COAG meeting to be held on 3 June. I seek a partnership with the states to tackle this problem. It is not something the Commonwealth will take over. It is something the Commonwealth will work with the states to solve. I think it is outrageous when we are so short of skilled tradesmen in this country. -  - It is very interesting that they are all interjecting. Don't they want these anomalies removed? -  - They are all interjecting. Do you know who may be responsible for some of these anomalies? They may in fact be people who think that the trade union movement should have a greater say in the training of young Australians. I want these anomalies eliminated. They can be eliminated in cooperation between the Commonwealth and states, and I am sure that the premiers of the various states who profess concern about these problems will willingly cooperate with me to bring about an end to this ridiculous situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his ongoing interest in this subject. I am aware of some recent comments because the Australian Labor Party is once again running a hysterical scare campaign about workplace relations reform, which sounds more and more desperate as each day goes by. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was predicting that some sort of iron curtain would fall on workplaces in Australia. According to an AAP report, the Leader of the Opposition told the Labor caucus yesterday about workplace relations reform:This is about the fundamental underpinnings of our democracy._            _            _It's important to remember that when the eastern European system cracked, that wasn't a product of newspaper editorials, it wasn't a product of student action, it was a product of trade union action through Solidarity.How desperate. According to the Leader of the Opposition, workplace relations reform now equals the death of democracy. He has form on this. In 1996, when we were considering the Workplace Relations Act, the Leader of the Opposition predicted that it would lead Australia:... straight down the American road on industrial relations legislation, straight down the American road on wages justice, and that produces social dislocation more than anything else.It was equivalent to what Bill Kelty, the then Secretary of the ACTU, was saying at the time. He said:If they want a fight, if they want a war, then we'll have the full symphony, the full symphony, all the pieces, all the clashes and all the music.They were wrong then. There was no war. Democracy continued to flourish. The iron curtain did not come down on workplaces in Australia. It just shows what a hysterical campaign the Leader of the Opposition is running. The reality is that the opposite happened. They do not like to hear that real wages went up by 14 per cent and industrial disputation has declined in this country. The Financial Review got it right today in an editorial entitled 'Beazley's pointless huffing and puffing', which stated:... it would be far better for the party's leaders to haul themselves out of the foetal position on reform - which they have also adopted on workplace relations ...We have heard that the Leader of the Opposition is determined not to determine a position on taxation. We just wish that he would determine to make a determination about workplace relations reform rather than continuing the scaremongering that he has been involved in for the last 10 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Plainly, security at airports is a real issue. There are just a couple of points that I would like to make here. I think it is very important that a couple of these misconceptions be cleaned up. The Inspector of Transport Security is a part-time position, as you have just acknowledged. What needs to be understood about this is that the idea, which initially was my department's, was that we would have, rather like we have in the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, someone who could on a no-blame basis investigate a security aspect or a security failure after such a failure happened. That has not happened. There has been no ground for referring or needing to refer a terrorism incident. We have not had a terrorist incident. If the Labor Party do not understand the difference between smuggling and criminal activity and terrorism then pity help us. But I say that they might get on top of it so that they can stop scaremongering. We have not had a terrorism incident. This position was created so that we would have someone -  - This is a serious issue that they raise. I am seeking to give the House a proper, quality explanation. The idea of having someone in this office was to ensure, just as we have no-blame accident investigations, that we had someone to look at an incident if one happened in the area of terrorism security, whilst everyone else in every other authority is engaged in dealing with an emergency and to ensure that we can learn from those events.The normal, ongoing business of looking after aviation security belongs to the Office of Transport Security. In fact, since the introduction of the new Aviation Transport Security Act on 10 March this year, the Office of Transport Security has undertaken - I think this is worth noting - 47 security audits, 70 aviation security inspections and 50 systems tests, conducted 345 visits to aviation industry participants and involved itself in 136 meetings with aviation industry participants about aviation security matters.The ongoing task of taking forward our aviation security policy belongs to the Office of Transport Security. I have always said that, as situations evolve - as they have in relation to airport security and smuggling matters - we will look at those, seek to learn from them and put in place appropriate responses. The Office of Transport Security will be bringing forward to me some recommendations as a result of recent incidents, and I will seek to act on those.In relation to the very important task that Mick Palmer is undertaking at the moment, should a need for a post terrorist incident investigation tragically emerge - and I hope and pray that it does not - we will address that situation when and if it arises.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question. Of course, it goes without saying that Australian exporters need a strong domestic economy from which to launch their operations into the global economy. Since elected, we have been working hard as a government to achieve and deliver that base for Australian business and particularly for Australian exporters. Low unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates and budget surpluses are all delivering a very, very strong Australian economy. We are also absolutely determined to continue to see the Australian economy grow in a sustainable fashion. That has been underpinned by the report from the OECD that came out today with economic forecasts for the Australian economy, particularly with regard to growth.Interestingly, the OECD also calls for continuing reforms. We cannot take the pressure off the reform process in making sure that we remain productive, competitive and efficient in the global marketplace. We as a government are determined to make our exporters more competitive. In our tax reform package in 1998 we removed $3.5 billion worth of taxes from the back of exports going out of Australia. In this year's budget, just released, we delivered $1.8 billion in tax relief to further enhance the competitiveness of Australian industry and exporters. That has certainly been welcomed by Australian business, as represented by the Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association. Those industry groups and their constituent members are determined to improve the competitiveness of our economy through their efforts.This year's budget also delivers $21.7 billion in personal income tax cuts, continuing our commitment to structural taxation reform, increasing incentives for workers and increasing the efficiency of the Australian economy. As a government we remain determined to deliver these tax cuts and also the certainty that 850,000 Australian businesses need over the next couple of months. We have a business community that is determined to improve productivity and competitiveness in what they are doing in the workplace in the interests of the Australian economy, yet we have the Australian Labor Party standing in the way of these tax cuts. The Australian Labor Party wants to create all sorts of mayhem with the Australian business community not being able to determine anything other than to determine not to determine something. The reality is that, whilst the government and business community of Australia want to get on with improving productivity, efficiency and competitiveness in the Australian economy, the Australian Labor Party is determined to stop tax cuts for Australian workers and create mayhem for the Australian business community.</DOC>

 - I plainly said that the taking forward of the government's aviation and transport security matters is the responsibility of the Office of Transport Security. They give me regular reports on what is happening; they make regular recommendations. And I confirm that, as I said, the part-time office of Inspector of Transport Security was set up by the government at my request so that we would have someone to review -  - an incident in relation to terrorism if one should happen. If you cannot see that the robust arrangements that the government has put in place to prevent a terrorist attack are enormous, world-class, monitored, regularly audited and taken forward then you are not listening. - I will make the point again that we felt that a 'belts and braces' application of this office might be wise so that, should a terrorism incident happen in Australia, we would have an appropriate person who could investigate, pick up any lessons that needed to be learnt and ensure that they could be readily applied in the circumstances, while all the other authorities would be very likely dealing with an emergency.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand why the member for Kingston might ask that question, because the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Kingston is up by 10 per cent since December 2003 thanks to the policies of the Howard government. This government does not just talk about Medicare. We spend the real money which is necessary to further improve Australia's health services.Since 1 January, the government has spent an additional $175 million on health through the 100 per cent Medicare policy. Under 100 per cent Medicare and the bulk-billing incentives that this government has put in place, GPs now receive $10 more than they received in January last year for bulk-billed consultations with children and pensioners. That is why more than eight out of 10 consultations with children and people over 65 are now bulk-billed. Since 1 January, the government has spent an additional $14 million on health through the Round the Clock Medicare policy, and I am pleased to say that more than 50 per cent of GPs have claimed the $10 after-hours loading for delivering after-hours services.If this government sees a problem we tackle it. This is not a government which cannot make up its mind. This is not a government which confuses bluster with strength. It will never be said of this government that we are determined not to determine a position - the disgraceful phrase that will always haunt this Leader of the Opposition. That is why the Australian people trust the Howard government with their health care and that is why the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I will spell it out in the simplest language I can. The role of this particular office is not preventative. That is the role of the Office of Transport Security. They are, and have been for some time, directly engaged in negotiating with the airports and the airlines in relation to some of the incidents that have happened recently. As I have always indicated, they report to me regularly. When there are lessons to be learnt, we learn them; when there are changes that need to be made, we make them. We take security seriously - I reassure the House of that. They have indicated to me that they will be bringing forward a number of recommendations arising out of recent incidents. That is their role. But we have not had a terrorism incident in this country, and I hope it remains that way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question and for asking it on this National Day of Healing. Only last week I announced the 12th new Indigenous family violence prevention legal service unit to provide support and legal services in Roma and other districts such as Cunnamulla, Quilpie and Charleville. I am pleased to note that they are sites in the member's electorate. I hope to be able to announce the 13th and final new unit in the near future. This means that the government will have delivered on its election commitment to double the total number of units helping Indigenous communities in rural and remote regions around Australia.The units provide legal and support services to help victims of family violence, mostly women and children, and those who are at immediate risk of such violence. I am advised that most of these new units, if not all, will be ready to open their doors from 1 July this year. This is an indication of not only the government's resolve to have these services up and running but also the willingness of organisations to be involved in providing suitable staff and working at a grassroots level. We are not only helping victims of violence; we are also helping to prevent violence. That is why, in relation to our other announcements involving the new family relationship centres, those centres will have associated with them for the first time an outreach program so that Indigenous Australians will be able to get help through obtaining face-to-face advice on resolving relationship difficulties. I think these initiatives demonstrate the government's real and ongoing commitment to practical reconciliation and to obtaining better outcomes for Australia's Indigenous people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The House will be aware of the issue of HIH and the great damage that was done to the insurance industry and obviously to a lot of innocent bystanders as a result of that and the action that was taken by both this government and the state governments in order to try to rectify that. The issue you raise has been brought to my attention and I am aware that a five-year sunset clause was agreed because it allows both the state and local governments sufficient time to put contingency arrangements into place to make possible HIH related liabilities incurred before 30 June 2005.Under the agreement, the HIH policy liability is deemed to have been incurred at the point in time at which the liability comes into existence - for example, at the date of the settlement of a judicial determination. This is important in relation to the councils and the situation that the honourable member has raised. This means that the funding is available to local councils if the HIH liability has been incurred on or before 30 June this year, regardless of when the application for assistance is actually received.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and his interest in this very important issue to all Australians. namely retirement incomes and, in particular, superannuation. The member for McMillan asked about community interest in the government's policies to do with superannuation. I can inform the member for McMillan that of the more than half a million Australians who have taken up the Howard government's co-contribution - under which, in the previous year, if they put a dollar in the government contributed a dollar towards their retirement incomes through superannuation - some 3,098 are constituents of the member for McMillan. They have made that contribution. They are looking after themselves and getting support from the coalition government to do so. It has been very much welcomed.This government has done an enormous amount to promote superannuation, while the opposition continues to erode superannuation. Nothing shows this more clearly than comparing the position of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party with that of the coalition on the last budget. The coalition moved to remove the surcharge which would inject another $2.5 billion into the savings and retirement incomes of Australians and what did the Labor Party say? It wants to reject it. It was the Leader of the Opposition who did not want to support the surcharge and opposed its introduction. It was the Labor Party that opposed the reduction in the surcharge rate and it is the Labor Party that is also opposing the removal of the surcharge. They are very consistent on this issue.What has the public had to say about it? The Investment and Financial Services Association, IFSA, has described this as a great budget for retirement savings, and so it is. We have had the financial adviser and respected financial writer Noel Whittaker write:The removal of the superannuation surcharge is a major step in helping Australians save for their future more effectively.We have also had Mr Kevin Bardsley, a Qantas ground crew employee, say that he is thinking of voting Liberal for the first time in his life because of the government's decision to abolish the surcharge. And as a bloke who knows a good government when he sees one, he knows that one side of the parliament is helping him to retire and have the sort of retirement that he deserves. Given the 3,098 members of the member for McMillan's electorate who have taken up the co-contribution and the removal of the $2 ½ billion of taxation that has been put into Australia's retirement incomes, and the fact that the Labor Party, which used to think it was the party of the worker and of superannuation, is no longer that party, you need to recant the last policy you had of removing $3.8 billion, ripping it out of the retirement savings of Australians, and applaud this government for the decisions we have taken in retirement incomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I know the member for Greenway will be interested to learn that as a result of the 2005 aged care allocation round, the Australian government will have allocated over 95,200 extra aged care places for the period 1996 to 2007-08 in community care, residential care and transition care. Just picture 95,200 places. That would more than fill the Olympic Stadium in Sydney. It is a significant increase in places. We have for the first time met the benchmark of 100 operational places per 1,000 of the population over the age of 70. Not only have we met that benchmark; we have exceeded it. We have now increased that benchmark to 108 places. Funding in aged care under this government has increased by over 135 per cent - $7 billion this year in aged care funding - over a period when the population aged over 70 has increased by something like 20 or 25 per cent.I am asked about alternative policies. As a matter of fact, there are no alternative policies from federal Labor on aged care. They left office with a 10,000-place deficit, according to the Auditor-General. Not once did they ever meet their own benchmark of 100 operational places. Today you just have to look at their web site. Apparently they had a policy review. The review has been completed and there is no policy listed for aged care. Last year the Treasurer announced a $2.2 billion package in aged care funding - and there was not one word from the then Leader of the Opposition in the budget-in-reply speech. This year the Treasurer announced an extra half a billion dollars on top of that for aged care funding. Again the Leader of the Opposition made not one mention of aged care in the budget-in-reply speech.It seems that members opposite are not even aware of state Labor policies in aged care. There is a program called Home and Community Care, funded about 60 per cent by the Australian government but managed by, and the services delivered by, the state governments. The federal government this year has allocated over $800 million to HACC with over $248 million in New South Wales. So when the member for Blaxland wrote to me asking why home care services in Bankstown were unable to expand their services because of lack of funding I was able to enlighten him. The older people in New South Wales are being denied access to over $65 million in home care funding that is sitting in the coffers of the New South Wales state government - $65 million that could be used for aged care services for people living at home requiring home services. That essentially indicates Labor's attitude to older Australians who need care. This government cares about older Australians.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the Leader of the Opposition that on this issue my guarantee is my record. Can I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that his problem is his record. Ten years ago the Leader of the Opposition and those who then sat behind him said the world would come to an end, that living standards would be slashed, that workers would be thrown on the scrap heap, the unions would be destroyed and the economy would come to a halt if we passed our industrial relations reforms. Just as those predictions were wrong, let me tell the Leader of the Opposition through you, Mr Speaker, that the predictions he makes today and will make in the days ahead will also be proved wrong.Over the last 9½ years the real wages of Australian workers under our industrial relations policy have risen by 14 per cent against the miserable 1.2 per cent under the policies that he said were for the welfare of the Australian workers. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is performance in this area that counts. You drove down the wages of Australian workers when you were in government. We have uplifted their wages, we have run the economy better, and it is going to be even better when these new reforms come in.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. Can I say to the House that the foundation of the current industrial relations system in Australia is one that was designed in the 1900s to deal with the problems of the 1890s. And the announcement which the Prime Minister made today will bring this system into the modern economy of the 21st century. That will mean more jobs, higher wages and better productivity, which will mean a better outcome for all Australians.One of the most significant elements of this package is that for the first time in Australia at a federal level the government will introduce a legislated set of minimum terms and conditions of employment. For the first time in the federal history of Australia this government will introduce a minimum legislated set of terms and conditions, something which has never been done before for the workers of Australia. The member for Forde asked me about higher productivity. By simplifying the agreement-making process; by allowing an easier lodgment process for agreements, both collective and individual; and by allowing agreements to run for a period of five years, these things and others in this package will improve productivity in this country.Furthermore, one national system of industrial relations, which is what this package is moving towards, will remove the costly, confusing and complex duplication of the state, federal and territory systems that operate at the present time. It is an idea whose time has come and this government will move towards introducing it. But what do we hear today from the Leader of the Opposition? All we hear is the same tired, old rhetoric that we have been hearing for the last 10 years. What we heard today from the Leader of the Opposition was that this will exercise downward pressure on wages and that this will mean that families will be worse off. What did he say in 1996? He said:... the government is attacking the very basis of people's living standards ... Attack wages, and you attack families.As I said, 10 years later, there has not been one change in the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition and yet, over that 10 years, we have seen a 14 per cent increase in the real wages of ordinary Australians. That stands in stark contrast to the miserly 1.2 per cent increase that occurred under 13 years of the Labor government, of which part of the time the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for employment policies in this country. I remind the House again of what the opposition spokesman said back in 1995-96, because no doubt we will hear more of this today and in the coming days. This is what Mr Smith, the member for Perth, said on 17 October 1995:The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages - wrong - it is about worse conditions - wrong - it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation - wrong - it is about the abolition of safety nets - wrong - and it is all about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards.Wrong. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.</DOC>

 - I simply say to the member for Perth, as I said to the Leader of the Opposition: my guarantee is my record. Let me add a few more things. We have talked about the 14.1 per cent increase in real wages. I remind those who sit opposite that the OECD recently found in its Taxing wages report that, on a purchasing power basis, the disposable income of the average Australian production worker is the second-highest in the OECD. According to the recent NATSEM survey, the strongest growth in private income from 1994 to 2002 was enjoyed by low-income households in Australia. - Not only have the real wages and incomes of Australian workers gone up but also more than 1.6 million new jobs have been created and our unemployment rate has fallen to a near 30-year low of 5.1 per cent. Australians have become wealthier, with real wealth per person having risen by more than 80 per cent in aggregate under the coalition or by 7½ per cent -  - The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth have asked me questions that go to the living standards of Australian workers, and I am pointing out that those living standards have risen over the last 9½ years at a rate that diminishes to a very great extent the performance of the former government. I would say to the rather excitable Leader of the Opposition - the fulminating Leader of the Opposition - that, as these reforms are implemented, there will be continuing increases in the living standards of Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The good news is that I can inform the House that legislation has passed the House of Representatives to give a tax cut to every Australian from 1 July this year. Unfortunately it was only this side of the House that voted for that legislation, but the people of Australia know this: Labor stands for higher taxes. The bill will ultimately pass the Senate and become law. However, for people to get their tax cut on 1 July, schedules for employers, which have to be tabled in the Senate, must not be disallowed, because these schedules tell the employers how much tax to withhold. The tax that they have to withhold will be very much less because of the budget we brought down this month.Whether or not those schedules are disallowed in the Senate is very much up to the Leader of the Opposition. It is up to him as to whether his party votes to disallow those schedules. He was asked yesterday about his position. I regret to inform you, Mr Speaker, that he said some uncomplimentary things about me. I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep last night after what he said about me, but I will overlook that and tell the House what he said on the substantive issue. He said: 
If Costello was out there concerned about business ...he would put for consideration those disallowable instruments when the Parliament's risen.In other words, 'If Costello was concerned for business, he would make sure that the ALP never got to vote on this legislation.' My duty to the nation is to ensure that the Labor Party does not get to vote on legislation! Labor cannot be trusted on these disallowable instruments, so it is my obligation to make sure that Labor does not get to vote. It is not the Leader of the Opposition's obligation to make sure Labor votes the right way; it is my obligation to make sure that the Australian Labor Party does not get to vote.Let me make this point clear: the introduction of these instruments into the Senate is not in my gift. Again the Leader of the Opposition showed his complete ignorance of this issue yesterday. He said the timing of this coming into the Senate was up to me. Let me make this point. The Commissioner of Taxation makes these schedules -  - by operation of law, and he has made these schedules because employers need to load them into their payroll systems. - Mr Harry Evans has given us some very interesting advice on this. I hope he will release it because, by operation of law, once the commissioner has made them, he has to lodge them with the Attorney-General's Department. Once they have been lodged with the Attorney-General's Department, by operation of law they have to be tabled in the Senate within six days. That means, by operation of law, as is now conceded by the Clerk of the Senate, those rules have to be tabled in the Senate on 14 June, when the Senate next sits.It is a very simple matter. If the Labor Party wants people to have their tax cuts, all the Leader of the Opposition has to say is that he will not disallow those schedules. It is not a hard thing to say. All he has to do is say, 'I will not be disallowing them.' The fact that he refuses to say what he will do is now causing confusion for 850,000 businesses. It is now causing uncertainty for millions of Australian taxpayers. This is a government which was elected as recently as October last year. This is a budget which it brought down in the first year of the term. These are tax cuts which every Australian deserves. These are tax cuts which have gone through the people's house, the House of Representatives, and should be paid on 1 July. There is one person who stands between the tax cuts that Australians deserve and their ability to get them and that is the Leader of the Opposition. I call on the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party backbench not to delay that tax cuts and cause confusion for Australian business. Get out of the way and let Australians have the tax cuts they deserve.</DOC>

 - As the member for Perth will know if he reads the announcement, the base for workplace agreements, be they collective or individual, will be the new Australian fair pay and conditions standard. It is set out in the statement what those things are. I point out to the member for Perth that under AWAs people have been better off than they have been under the award. Once again, it is a question of performance against rhetoric. The member for Perth imagines that the average Australian worker is going to look at the last nine years and the way in which his or her pay packet has gone up, their unemployment rate has gone down and their living standards have improved and say, 'That's very interesting, but the member for Perth has told me the world's going to come to an end, so I'll believe the member for Perth.' I do not believe they will. The member for Perth was up here and was wrong, as the minister pointed out, on five predictions. He will be wrong again in relation to his new predictions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I can inform her that regrettably I have seen state budgets that are not in the interests of the Australian people. The Australian Capital Territory is forecasting a cash deficit in this financial year, a blow-out on its forecast; the Northern Territory is forecasting a cash deficit next financial year, a blow-out on its mid-year review; Victoria is forecasting a cash deficit, a blow-out on its budget update; and while Tasmania is predicting a cash surplus, it is predicting a fiscal deficit for 2005-06. South Australia and Western Australia are bringing down budgets today.If you want an example of how economic mismanagement can deteriorate a situation, you need look no further than the state of New South Wales under the Carr Labor government. The Carr Labor government used to report its bottom line in fiscal terms. If it had reported its bottom line in fiscal terms, it would have shown a fiscal deficit of $979 million in 2005-06. So do you know what the New South Wales Labor government did? It changed the bottom line measure from fiscal deficit to operating balance so that it could show that it was not in deficit. The New South Wales government used to have a thing called the General Government Debt Elimination Act 1995 to constrain borrowing. In its recent budget, the New South Wales government announced that it was repealing that act.New South Wales will receive an estimated $45 billion in GST revenue over the next four years and a $1.6 billion windfall. Far from using that windfall to cut taxes, the Carr government in its recent budget announced increased taxes, abolishing the exemption on stamp duty for refinancing mortgages - remember the GST is designed to allow for the abolition of stamp duty on mortgages. And get a load of this: the New South Wales Carr government hiked the general insurance tax up from five per cent to nine per cent, affecting every household in New South Wales. And get a load of this: the stamp duty goes on the grossed up GST value of the insurance policy. So they gross the insurance policy up with GST which goes to the state government and then they put a nine per cent tax on the insurance policy, including the GST. The New South Wales Carr government forecast its land tax to rise to $1.63 billion in 2005-06, up 13 per cent on last year. And get a load of this: land tax in New South Wales has gone up since the election of the Carr government by 200 per cent.New South Wales consumers and businesses are now paying for Labor mismanagement. What did I say earlier? Labor stands for higher taxes. You can see that in this federal parliament and in the state parliaments around Australia. Mark Bethwaite, the Chief Executive of Australian Business Ltd, said:The New South Wales budget is a disappointment. It does not deal with our competitiveness as a state. Lost opportunities business faces every day because of state government taxes and charges. It represents a missed opportunity for the state that was once the premier state.That is what Australian Business Ltd said. You see what happens when Labor gets into government in New South Wales - it runs deficits and increases taxes. When Labor is in opposition, this government puts down $22 billion of income tax cuts in its budget and the Labor Party votes against it. Labor will still give no guarantee that those withholding schedules will go through the Senate and allow Australians to have their tax cuts on 1 July. Why? Labor stands for higher taxes. Get out of the way, Labor, and let Australians have the tax relief they deserve.</DOC>

 - Let me say in response to the shadow minister that I am not going to play her game.  -  - I am not going to go endlessly into this business of who said what to whom and when did they say it, suffice to say that -   -  - the government knew that there was going to be an increase in the cost of the safety net. We knew before the election that there would be and we made that clear in the pre-election financial outlook -  
 -  - and we made it clear in the Charter of Budget Honesty.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and acknowledge that he has returned from Bougainville as an election observer there. All of us would appreciate the very good work that he has done. I understand that the election is going smoothly, so that is good.Today I met with the Papua New Guinean Foreign Minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, and the Minister for Internal Security, the Police Minister, Bire Kimisopa, and we had a good discussion about the future of the Enhanced Cooperation Program. We agreed that the Enhanced Cooperation Program is an innovative program, with the placement of police and officials into in-line positions being a central principle of the ECP, and that needs to remain. There is a strong commitment on both sides to finding a solution to the legal problems raised by the recent Supreme Court ruling. In the meeting we agreed to keep all options on the table at this stage because it is important that any future agreement is protected from future court challenges. I think the House would understand that. Officials will meet this afternoon, and they will meet in the next couple of weeks in Port Moresby as well, to work through the detailed legal issues.It is clear from what the Papua New Guinean Foreign Minister has said, as well as from my own experience, that the Enhanced Cooperation Program is very popular with the public in Papua New Guinea. Usually the Labor Party latch onto something that is popular, if they possibly can. So I am surprised they are against it - not that they succeed too often. The Enhanced Cooperation Program is an enormously important initiative. I think it has the potential to make a great difference in Papua New Guinea and, if we can resolve the legal issues, we are going to be able to get it back firmly on track.</DOC>

 - Let me say in reply to the member for Lalor that, like the Minister for Health and Ageing, I am not going to play these little games either, except to add this: it is true, as the minister said in his answer, that there was an increase in cost, and that was disclosed in the pre-election financial statement. Also, the member asking the question would, I am sure, be painfully aware of the costing done by the Department of Finance and Administration, which was released on the eve of the election itself and which, I think, dealt with something called 'Medicare Gold'.I think the member for Lalor has completely overlooked one other reference to cost advice, and that was the information that I provided to the Australian public in an interview on AM the day after I had announced the government's changes in relation to the Medicare safety net when I indicated that recent advice we had received indicated that there was going to be a further ratcheting up of the cost. That, of course, was part of the basis of the decision. After two wasted questions, can I assure the member for Lalor that there is no conspiracy, no cover-up; simply a sensible decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and the very strong campaign she has run for better funding of New South Wales government schools and the Ulladulla High School in particular. It is the all too common and sad experience of parents in Australian government schools, especially in the state of New South Wales, to find that the schools to which they send their children, whilst of a high quality in education, are frequently leaking, freezing in winter, extremely hot in summer, peeling paint and have a whole range of unmet maintenance issues.It is known by those parents that the state governments are responsible for those schools; that they own them, administer them and basically fund them. Australian parents also know, however, that the Australian government makes a contribution to those public schools. I am very pleased to tell the member for Gilmore and other members of the House that in this budget the Australian government has increased its funding for capital works for public state schools in the state of New South Wales by 35 per cent. I might add that $54 million of that will, for the first time, go directly to parents, to P&amp;Cs and to school principals. It will go to the families at the Bowral Public School, whose kids are freezing in the winter; to the kids at the Ulladulla High School, whose school looks like a mining camp welded onto the side a school; and to the parents at the Tuggerawong Public School, where you can smell the toilets from the road when you get out of your car. It will go to these and to many other important projects.So, like the Treasurer, with some interest I looked at the New South Wales budget this year. New South Wales teachers, their unions, parents and this government have been looking with interest to see what the contribution from the New South Wales government would be for maintenance. When I read the maintenance budget for New South Wales government schools from the New South Wales government, it was $184 million. I thought I must be reading last year's budget papers, because last year they cut their maintenance budget by 11 per cent to $184 million. Then I thought, 'That can't be true.' So I tuned into Steve Price on 2UE on Tuesday afternoon on the 24th and I heard the authority, the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Carmel Tebbutt, being interviewed on this matter. Price said:And the figure for maintenance. What was that?Tebbutt: $184 million.Price: And what was that in last year's budget?Tebbutt: $184 million.Price: So there's no increase?Tebbutt: That's right.Let it be known by every parent in the country who has a child in a government school, particularly in New South Wales, that when their child suffers because of the appalling state of maintenance of their schools they need to remember two things. The first thing to remember is that this government has increased its funding by 35 per cent in one budget and has given $38 million of that $54 million directly to the parents of New South Wales. The second thing to remember is that when they see Bob Carr reading books to kids on Sundays - and somebody else we know used to do that - they need to remember he is trying to hide from them the fact that the paint on the ceilings is peeling and that schools have appalling maintenance conditions because of the underfunding by the state government.</DOC>

 - The direct answer to the question is no, and I will explain the basis of that assertion. Let me inform the House that the Tran family has been in community accommodation since 13 April 2005. The family was provided with that accommodation by the department, using its discretion to provide flexible alternative detention arrangements, since 13 April 2005. The reasons for that were matters relating to the period leading up to the birth.My department was advised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs yesterday that the family would continue to remain in community accommodation in Perth and there was no immediate plan to return them to Christmas Island. That was the basis of the advice that I correctly gave to the House yesterday. The information I had was the information provided to me by my department. It was the position then, it remains the position, and it was the basis for the answer that I gave. It is not a question of doing anything on the run. It is a question of accurately reflecting the advice that I have received.I might also point out to the Leader of the Opposition and to others interested in this matter that this was a decision taken in the exercise of its discretion by the department of immigration. It was not taken on my instruction and it was not taken, as I understand it, other than in accordance with the discretion. It stands to reason, if you just stop and think for a moment, that the family was taken to the alternative accommodation on 13 April in the lead-up to the birth of the child. It is going to continue in that alternative accommodation, so therefore it is totally illogical to assert that in some way the decision for the family to continue in the alternative accommodation was taken on the run by me yesterday in question time. Surely even the Leader of the Opposition would accept that that is an absurd proposition.I have been further informed that the department has advised that it will not force the family to return to Christmas Island but rather will discuss a range of accommodation options available to them, which include community accommodation and possibly a return to Christmas Island if the family desires. Could I point out to the House that this family, as merit assessments and other assessments stand at the moment, are illegally in this country. Let us remember that. They are illegally in this country at the present time and, when their final status is determined, there is a question of whether the family will return to Vietnam. It is of course open to the family to return to Vietnam at any time prior to that. But at no stage in relation to this case has policy been made on the run. They were provided with the alternative accommodation well before the birth of the child and well before the matters that were before the Senate estimates committees yesterday. I would just encourage the Leader of the Opposition not to grab the latest headline as the basis for his next question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. Beef is a very valuable industry as far as the export industry in Australia is concerned, particularly in her electorate of Indi and particularly in the high mountain country in Indi. Beef is Australia's largest agricultural export in dollar terms. Australia exported $4.6 billion worth of beef in 2004, a record. With regard to major markets, like the United States, on 1 January this year all tariffs were removed from beef going into the United States and, last year, 91 per cent of all beef imported into Japan came from Australia. So, needless to say, it is one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. In the first quarter of 2005 Australia's beef exports topped the $1 billion mark. This is the first time in Australia's history that we have achieved that figure of $1 billion in the first three months of any year.Notwithstanding the fact that in Victoria, the member's state, they export over $600 million worth of beef per annum, we saw yesterday the breathtaking announcement by the Bracks Labor government in Victoria that they are going to close down access to national parks for grazing. They are going to stop the beef industry in Victoria grazing in the national parks. This is just the same as the ideologically driven policies of Latham Labor when Latham Labor was going to close down the forests in Tasmania. Beazley's Labor policy on the Kyoto protocol is anti jobs, Latham Labor's was anti jobs and the Bracks government is also anti jobs in the beef industry. -  -  The Bracks government's ideological beef is going to cost 45 families in Victoria their livelihood, and that is something that we know the Labor Party does not care about - families in regional Australia. -  - We have in the gallery today some of those beef producers who are being denied the right to a livelihood in Victoria. Buff Rogers, Chris Cummins, John Cook and Simon Turner have brought their complaints to Canberra about the Bracks Labor government. We need to recognise their concerns. All they want to do is earn an honest living, and that is being denied by the Bracks Labor government. As was reported on the front page of the Melbourne Age yesterday, under the headline 'After 170 years, it's the last round-up', Peter Ryan, The National's leader in Victoria, said:Steve Bracks will go down in history as the man who killed the Man from Snowy River.Just as the Beazley-led Labor Party in Canberra is going to stop Australians getting $21.7 billion worth of tax cuts, the Bracks Labor Party in Victoria is stopping honest Australians in regional Victoria earning an honest living.</DOC>

 - I am not going to try to confirm any one of those particular things. The reason I am not going to do it is that I have not had the opportunity today of reading the transcript of the evidence. I would point out, with respect and I hope courteously, to the Leader of the Opposition that he has just as much capacity as I do to read the transcript of evidence given before the Senate. I am aware of claims that have been made about an email being sent from somebody in DIMIA to somebody else suggesting that there had been an illegal deportation. Clearly these are serious matters and they will be examined by the Palmer inquiry. I repeat what I said before: when we have the results of that inquiry and we have all the facts in front of us, we can make a proper assessment. I do not really think that it aids a sober examination of what is a serious issue, for the Leader of the Opposition to be a serial question asker of the latest piece of evidence without having the full context.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question -  - The pronunciation is Goldstein, I think you will find. Perhaps we can have that debate instead of the MPI later!The government is taking substantive action to address climate change. The latest figures show that our $1.8 billion national climate change strategy is working. The national greenhouse gas inventory released a couple of days ago showed that our greenhouse gas emissions for 2003 were only 1.1 per cent higher than in 1990. Compare this to, say, Canada's 2002 emissions, which were 57 per cent higher than in 1990; Spain's, which were 33 per cent higher; Ireland's, which were 28 per cent higher; New Zealand's, which were 27 per cent higher; and Japan's, which were 21 per cent higher. I use those countries as examples because they have all signed up to the Kyoto protocol. While our emissions increased by only 1.1 per cent from 1990 to 2003, over the same period our real GDP as a country has increased by 51.9 per cent. It shows that we are doing a good job in this country by ensuring that we bring these emissions under control.The honourable member asks whether there are any alternative views. The Labor Party, as an article of faith, says that we should sign up to Kyoto. This is the policy that even Mark Latham took to the last election, yet the member for Grayndler said yesterday that the 1.1 per cent increase in emissions confirms the Labor Party's 'worst fears' that 'greenhouse pollution continues to soar'. Let us try to understand what this means. It means that Labor does not believe just in Kyoto; Labor believes that we should do massively better and should have targets way below the targets that have been set for Kyoto. If that is Labor's policy - since it believes that a 1.1 per cent increase is somehow contemptuous - and if the Labor Party's policy is therefore more radical than Kyoto, it should tell the Australian public. Such a policy would devastate jobs in this country, it would devastate the Australian economy and we would be back to the sorts of economic conditions we had when the Labor Party was last in office, with 11 per cent unemployment and interest rates of up to 17 per cent for home owners.The simple fact is that the Labor Party does not know what it is talking about on these issues. On the one hand, it says it believes in Kyoto; on the other hand, it argues that Kyoto is completely inadequate. That sort of incompetent incoherence from the Labor Party is what we are entirely used to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and I also thank him for his work as Chairman of the government backbench Committee on Health. I can inform him and the House that we do not know whether there will be a flu pandemic, but we do know that the risk is higher than ever and we also know that the consequences could be very serious indeed.Last year's budget provided $114 million to build up a stockpile of antiviral drugs and, thanks to this foresight, Australia now has one of the world's largest stockpiles of these important drugs. The government is currently stockpiling 50 million syringes, 40 million surgical masks and also extra ventilators and negative pressure units for possible use in hospitals. The government is in regular contact with CSL about the possible production of a candidate vaccine for pandemic flu. In the most recent budget, the government provided a further $23 million towards the establishment of a World Health Organisation collaborating influenza laboratory to be located in Melbourne, one of only four such laboratories in the world. In cooperation with the states, the government is finalising a draft management plan for pandemic influenza, and I expect that plan to be released for public information and comment within the next fortnight. Pandemic influenza is a daunting prospect, but I can assure the House that the World Health Organisation believes that Australia is as well prepared as any country in the world to meet this threat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him and all members of the House that Australia's 1.2 million small businesses will benefit from $21 billion of personal tax cuts and $1.8 billion of business tax cuts, on top of the $1.2 billion from the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax discount. This means that small businesses can reinvest in their businesses. I want to tell you, Mr Speaker, that small businesses right around the country want to pass on the personal tax cuts to their 3.3 million workers on 1 July. But they are being prevented from reinvesting in themselves and they are being prevented from passing on these tax cuts by the blocking tactics of the opposition. In addition, the opposition's tactics are placing an unnecessary burden on all small businesses, because they now, as we know, have to use two alternative tables looking at those different withholding tax rates.Let me get on the record what Mr Craig Winkler, the CEO of MYOB, one of the largest suppliers of payroll software packages to small businesses around the country, said: 'If these tax cuts are not passed before 1 July, the cost to small businesses in time and money is potentially enormous.' It does not matter what spin the Leader of the Opposition and any member of the opposition place on this issue. Their action demonstrates that they have absolutely no commitment to small businesses around this country.</DOC>

 - Let me spend a moment in answering that question. Firstly can I say with regard to the last part of the question that I do not intend to relieve Senator Vanstone of her responsibilities. It remains the case that as far as future action is concerned I will await, as I have said in the past, the outcomes.The Leader of the Opposition has raised the question of the 201 cases. If I could take a moment of the House's time, I think it may be interested in the background of these. I have been informed that during the period of July 2000 to April 2005 over 88,000 people were located and detained by DIMIA as suspected unlawful noncitizens or working in breach of their visa conditions. Can I say in defence of the department that this is a department that is doing the job that it is charged under the legislation to do. We have often heard from the opposition about enforcement action in relation to noncompliance, with people who have overstayed their visas or illegal immigrants. Surely nothing critical can be said of the department for doing its job. Of these 88,000 cases, some 201 individuals fell into the category where the person released from detention was recorded in the system as 'released as not unlawful'. In other words, their presence in Australia was not found, after investigation, to be unlawful. That represented 0.2 per cent of people located as a result of the compliance action.What the minister did, so far from covering it up, was instruct the department to go back over the available records to find the 201 cases where people had been released and, in order to find out whether those 201 included any Rau or Alvarez type cases, refer all of them to the Palmer inquiry. That is not, in defence of Senator Vanstone, the behaviour of a minister who is trying to cover something up. In relation to the 201 people, half of them were detained for very short periods of time. Establishing a person's identity and resolving a person's lawful status in Australia can be difficult for a number of reasons. Misleading and false information often provided by people can further complicate and prolong the issue.The opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot, quite rightly, call for an immigration system that makes sure that people who are illegally in this country are dealt with, and then in the next breath make a sweeping and blanket condemnation of the department. I remain of the view, and it remains the government's position, that we will allow the Palmer inquiry to run its course. When we have a proper analysis of the facts then - and only then - will I and the government give consideration to what further action might be taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer to the first part of it is that the Acting Consul-General in Bali, Ross Tysoe, went and called on Ms Schapelle Corby immediately after she returned to the prison on Friday. He had a discussion with her for about 40 minutes and is obviously doing his best to monitor her welfare. He did offer her the services of a doctor if she wished, and I know that she said she did not need those services. Ross Tysoe, by the way, was the Consul-General in Bali at the time of the Bali bombing, so he knows the place very well, and I think he has done a very good job.In answer to the second part of the question, I spoke with the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs on the telephone yesterday. He was in Hanoi. We had a discussion about two issues, one of them being the case of Schapelle Corby. I explained to him that in Australia we obviously accepted the Indonesian legal processes but that there was substantial concern in Australia about this issue. He said that he was aware of the issue and aware of some of the controversy in Australia. He did say that Indonesia would be willing to negotiate a prisoner transfer agreement and I explained to him that our team would be up there at the beginning of next week. We have already sent a draft of a prisoner transfer agreement to the Indonesians.I also take the opportunity of saying that I can understand that people have feelings one way or another about the Schapelle Corby case. A lot of people in Australia feel that she is innocent and she should be freed and so on. Let me just make this point, though: nothing is going to be gained on behalf of Schapelle Corby or anybody else by constant berating and abuse of Indonesia, the Indonesian government and the Indonesian legal system. That is just going to be counterproductive. It will not help Schapelle Corby and it will not help our broader national interests. It is important that people who wish to campaign for Schapelle Corby remember that, ultimately, the authorities they have to convince are the Indonesian judicial authorities. Abuse of Indonesia will not encourage support in Indonesia for their cause, and it is very important that that is remembered. There are 156 Australians serving sentences overseas. The government will provide support for those people, as Australian governments have always done. We will continue to do that in all of those cases.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform the House today, 30 May, that if the government's legislation is not blocked in the Senate every Australian will have a tax cut in 31 days time on 1 July. New voices have added themselves to the call for an improvement in Australia's income tax system. Mr Bracks, the Premier of Victoria, is reportedly coming to Canberra on Friday to demand that inefficiencies in the income tax system at both ends of the spectrum be attended to. Of course, that is precisely what the government announced in its budget - cutting the rates for low-income earners and increasing the threshold for the top marginal rates. We now have Premier Bracks calling for those reforms. We have had Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, allegedly telling senators not to oppose the cuts. We have had Kevin Foley demanding that the income tax cuts go through, Paul Lennon saying that he would advise federal Labor not to block the tax cuts and, of course, we had Geoff Gallop actually claiming that he is responsible for these tax cuts. I know of not one Premier who is supporting the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. Isn't that extraordinary? There are eight Labor chief ministers and premiers and, out of eight, not one has yet come to the defence of the Leader of the Opposition.All Australians can have their tax cuts if the tax schedules are not disallowed. Those tax schedules are now in this House. So, if Labor wants to disallow those tax schedules, it can call a vote in this House. The tax schedules will also be tabled in the Senate the day the Senate next sits. The Senate does not sit until 14 June. If the Australian Labor Party votes for a disallowance in the Senate some time after 14 June, 850,000 Australian employers will be thrown into confusion and all Australians who deserve a tax cut will not get it.The critical question now is: has the Labor Party made its decision? Has it decided on what it will be doing with those tax schedules? The member for Lilley was asked at a doorstop this morning if Labor had decided to disallow the tax schedules, and the member for Lilley said: 'No. Labor has made its position very, very clear' - which is what: you will or you won't?Labor is still resolutely irresolute in its decision, decidedly undecided, unwavering in its indecision and certain of its doubts. It is determined not to determine whether or not to disallow these schedules. This is a joke. This is not leadership. This is not decisiveness. This is confusion and mismanagement. We call on the Australian Labor Party to announce the position. Do not disallow, do not throw employers into confusion, and let every Australian have the tax cut they deserve in 31 days time.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. When I spoke of my record, I spoke both generically and specifically. I spoke generically of the government's record over the last 9½ years but I also spoke specifically of the lowest unemployment in 30 years. I spoke specifically of the more than doubling of the apprenticeships and traineeships available to young Australians. I spoke specifically of the fact that the average mortgagor in Australia is saving $500 a month on his mortgage as a result of the policies of this government. Being even more specific, I spoke of my record in leading a government that has presided over a 14 per cent increase in the real wages of Australian workers over the last 9½ years. I can only say again that, just as the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, this government has been a better friend of the Australian worker than that lot opposite could ever dream of being. It was the workers of Australia who threw Labor into opposition and it has been the workers of Australia who have kept this government in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for the question and, to take up the theme of the Prime Minister's previous answer, there is no doubt that the best friend that farmers have ever had has been the Howard-Anderson government. We have been prepared to respond to the needs of farmers in difficult times. Just a little while ago the Prime Minister announced new assistance to help farmers through these very difficult times. There is no doubt that the current drought has had an immense impact particularly on rural and regional Australia, and many believe it to be the worst drought in at least 100 years. The government has already provided over $680 million in direct payments to Australian farmers, and about another $80 million in auxiliary benefits through such things as health care cards and access to the Youth Allowance.The first four months of 2005 have been the hottest and second driest start to a year on record. There is no end to the drought in sight. The concerns that farmers have for their future are heightened when there is no rain on the horizon. For this reason - the severity and the extent of the drought - the government will provide an additional $254 million in benefits to support farm families during these tough times. The Prime Minister announced earlier that, effective from today, the off-farm assets test for the EC business support will double, from $217,000 to $435,000. The interest rate subsidy will increase from 50 per cent to 80 per cent in the second and subsequent years of an EC declaration. There will be a $10,000 annual offset against the income test for the EC relief payment. All of those measures will mean that more farmers will be eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance. They will get it in a more timely way and the benefits they receive will be even more generous.The streamlined assessment process for EC will continue and we will be providing around $2 million in additional support for the rural financial counselling services, including the appointment of 10 additional drought counsellors in the worst affected areas. There is $4 million to support the family relationship services program and $3 million for the Country Women's Association, to help them support farm families in the worst affected areas. In addition to that, the government will be providing $10 million for a special round of the Envirofund, to help communities and individual property owners to undertake projects which will help protect our biodiversity during these dry times and make sure that our environment is protected, as best we can, from the ravages of drought.These new measures demonstrate that the government has been responsive to the concerns of farmers. We have reacted on a number of occasions since this drought began to make the EC arrangements more generous. This is a further demonstration of our willingness to stand beside farmers and their families during these tough times so that, once the seasons return to normal, the rural economy can again contribute mightily to our national welfare.</DOC>

 - Isn't this typical of the opposition's response - Labor's attitudes to farmers facing difficulty? I am appalled at the scorn with which the opposition leader responds to a $254 million boost in assistance to farmers. The reality is that the government considered a range of measures and looked at the ways in which we could best help farmers. We took the view that an interest rate subsidy would help those farmers most in need - those who need to borrow because of the impact of the drought - and, therefore, that this interest rate subsidy is the most effective way of dealing with the drought in these circumstances.Let me say that it is the height of hypocrisy for a Labor leader to criticise the fact that the Commonwealth is not introducing a grants scheme, when the Labor Party in Victoria axed their grants scheme for farmers as soon as their state election was over. Labor in Victoria did not think an assistance scheme of that nature was appropriate, and as soon as their election was over they axed the assistance. The reality is Labor's record - both at the state and at the national level - in drought assistance has been way surpassed by what this government is doing.We know that farmers are facing difficulties and we are prepared to help, even when we do not get cooperation from our Labor state colleagues. We are prepared to do our part to help farmers through these difficult times. Frankly, I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition has not endorsed this additional assistance, which is to be provided to some of the most needy people in our community.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his interest. The honourable member may be aware that the last round of negotiations between the East Timorese and our officials was in Sydney from 11 to 13 May. That was the seventh meeting of our delegations since the talks began just over a year ago.The discussions put us on the threshold of an agreement with East Timor; all of the major elements of an agreement have been agreed between the officials. The agreement, as they say in diplomacy, is ad referendum: subject to final approval by the two respective cabinets. Officials are working on the finetuning of some minor aspects of the agreement, but this is an agreement that will considered by the two cabinets soon.The deal adopts an East Timorese proposal of setting aside permanent maritime boundaries and claims in the Timor Sea for 50 years. East Timor will receive an increased share of Greater Sunrise revenues once production commences. Depending on the price of oil - and we cannot, of course, predict it far into the future - that could be worth some $US2 billion to $US5 billion to East Timor, just to give a figure that is indicative of what they may get. This is in addition to the generous 90 per cent share of revenues that East Timor receives from the joint development area between Australia and East Timor, which will deliver $US14½ billion to East Timor over the next 20 years, or an average of $US2 million a day.It is important to make the point that this is at least a draft agreement, which safeguards Australia's sovereign interests while being generous to East Timor. That is what we have wanted to achieve. The East Timorese foreign minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, has a very good article in the Age newspaper today which characterises the negotiations as being 'on the cusp of securing for the people of Timor Leste the fairest agreement possible.' He described the deal as 'the best overall agreement that enhances our' - East Timor's - 'national interest.'There are still some members of the public who accuse Australia of dealing unfairly with East Timor and have spent significant amounts of money on advertising campaigns and the like to promote their cause. We agree with Jose Ramos-Horta's assessment that such people are pursuing their own, personal campaigns. I quote Jose Ramos-Horta: 'with some degree of blind faith'. On this issue it is important that people examine the facts. On acquaintance with the facts, I think they will see that this has the potential to be a very good, mutually beneficial agreement.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, it is easy to ignore the last part because the first part had enough infertile material in it to have an effective response. As I mentioned in my first comment, the reality is that this is the worst drought in our nation's history. It is appropriate, therefore, that additional measures apply in situations that go beyond previous experience. We are facing a drought that, as the honourable member said in his question, has gone on in some places for up to four years. Surely the responses that might have been appropriate in a more normal drought are inadequate in circumstances where there has been a drought for three or four years.When the drought policy was adjusted in 1997, this government reintroduced the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, which Labor had gutted in office and made it an ineffective mechanism for farmers to put money aside in their good years to help them through the bad. We restored and rebuilt that scheme in such a way that farmers are able to use it now to help them through much of these tough times.Let me also make one other comment. I note that the Leader of the Opposition has discovered over the last couple of days that there is a drought. He has given us the latest Labor Party response to the drought: he has formed a frontbench committee to liaise with the backbench committee on the drought. I am sure the farmers feel much more relaxed knowing that a frontbench Labor committee will negotiate with the backbench committee. Between them, they will not be able to find anybody who has ever been in a drought - who knows anything about it - and I think they would be far better off responding positively to the way in which this government has seen the need, provided real assistance to farmers and helped them through these really tough times.</DOC>

 - I thank the honour-able member for her question. I am delighted to say that, unquestionably, AusLink is the most important change to the way that we both plan and fund our national transport corridors in this country. The government recognise that, while the states are the primary providers of infrastructure, we have a very important role to play in interstate and international connectivity. Under AusLink we are developing strategies with the states, local government and the private sector to ensure that we can maximise economic growth and other desirable outcomes for our transport infrastructure into the future. I am delighted to tell the House that, on Friday, Victoria and the Australian government signed the AusLink bilateral. That is a very substantial step forward for the planning and the funding, and it is the cooperative approach we need, for infrastructure development in Australia. - I hear an interjection, 'What about Deer Park?' The sum of $1.15 billion will now start to flow for these projects in Victoria. We have agreed to continue discussing Scoresby. That money is still available for a freeway. That money will also take forward the port of Melbourne-Dynon link, where we have cooperatively designed a better approach for our export performance in that critical part of our national infrastructure; the Geelong Bypass, the Pakenham Bypass and the Calder Highway. Interestingly and importantly, Victoria and South Australia - which had already given a prior commitment in this regard - have agreed to apply the national code of practice for the construction industry. They recognise the importance of a flexible, realistic and proper approach to industrial relations. Regrettably some of the other states are still issuing their mantra to the effect that they are beholden to their union mates, but there are promising signs that New South Wales might recognise reality. I hope that the other Australian governments will fall into line very rapidly. There is a lot of focus on our national infrastructure these days. A lot of Commonwealth money - $12.6 billion - is also on the table. We need that money to flow, but it will flow when and as we have the bilateral agreements that ensure we will get value for the taxpayers' money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. This is a dynamic agreement not a static one and it continues to deliver benefits for Australian business and the Australian economy. One of our objectives when we were negotiating the free trade agreement was to get freer movement of professional people to work in the United States and in Australian businesses that have invested in the United States, and access for their families. At the time the US congress had a concern, not necessarily about Australia but with some aspects of opening up opportunities for foreign workers coming into the United States, and therefore at the conclusion of the negotiation it was not part of the package. But the US congress agreed to continue to work with Australia on this very important issue. Our team in Washington, very ably led by then Ambassador Thawley, continued to lobby and work with congress and the specific committee in congress to achieve our goals in terms of getting more Australians access to work in the United States.At the beginning of this month the US congress passed legislation which was quite historic. It has passed legislation allocating a new visa for Australians only to go and work in the United States. It is called an E3 visa. The E3 professional visa will allow up to 10,500 Australian professionals per annum to go into the United States and work, replacing the old H1B visa, which was for a global allocation of 65,000 places for foreigners to come and work in the US. Last year, out of those 65,000 places, Australians only filled 900 because they had to compete in that global allocation. Now we have a specific category, the E3 visa, which is just for Australians, and 10,500 Australians will be able to go and work in the United States in businesses and in Australian companies that have invested in the US.Some interesting comments have been made about this. Consultant David Crawford said:We hear weekly from Australian business people who are frustrated by the problem of trying to get professional staff into growing US operations.This is the first time the US congress has created a special visa category for any country. At the time of the announcement a senior US official said that he did not think any other country at the moment would be able to get this sort of visa concession in the current climate in the United States. It epitomises the ongoing and dynamic nature of the US free trade agreement that continues to deliver benefits for the Australian economy and for individuals working in Australia and in the United States and that continues to add economic significance to the relationship.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the honourable member for Perth that, so far from imposing real wage cuts, this government has presided over real wage increases. Can I just pick up the point about members of parliament's salaries, seeing that the honourable member for Perth has raised the issue. I will not walk away from making the statement to this parliament that I do not believe that members of parliament - and I speak of people on both sides of this place - are overpaid. We have had a veritable parade of populism from those who sit opposite. At a time when it is in the national interest to attract people of ability into parliament on both sides, this constant resort to populism both by the member for Perth and by the Leader of the Opposition does not do the profession that we try to practise any service at all. And if we lament - as I certainly do - about how difficult it is, particularly at the state level, to attract people of ability to run for parliament - and that is certainly the experience of the Liberal Party - I do not think that the course of action being taken by the opposition is in the national interest at all. It is typical of the bankruptcy of their alternative policies that all they can engage in is a bit of cheap populism at the expense of a calling and a commitment that, if this country is to have a future, is important to both sides of politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I can report to him that there has been overwhelmingly favourable editorial coverage of the government's proposals. For example, the Australian's headline said 'A big win for all the workers', the Financial Review said 'These reforms are a winner' and the Sydney Morning Herald, amongst other things in its editorial, said:These bold changes will deliver substantial net benefits.Perhaps the Weekend Australian captured something about this in its editorial when it said:Drama merchants in the Labor Party and the unions are warning of horrors to come following changes to the industrial relations laws.It went on to say:It is all nonsense - a fantasy from union apologists frightened of change.We have seen some examples of this over the last couple of days. Firstly, on the Sunday program on Channel 9 yesterday when the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, was asked about this, he asserted that there would be one minimum wage, which is currently $12.60 an hour. This is an example of what the Prime Minister and I were saying last week, that we would see this dishonest, scaremongering campaign from the unions and the ALP. Mr Combet on Sunday said there would be one minimum wage, currently $12.60 an hour. The reality is that this package actually delivers minimum wages through the classifications that currently exist - not one minimum wage but minimum wages retaining the classifications. So Mr Combet was wrong.We had another example of this on The World Today last Friday. There was an interview with a number of people including a Fran Tierney. Fran Tierney said that she was a worker relying on the minimum wage case. She said she was on $16 an hour and talked about having wages reduced to $5 or $6 an hour. Again, this is totally wrong. She obviously has not read the package. But what Ms Fran Tierney failed to disclose to the reporter on The World Today were a number of things. Firstly, that she is the New South Wales Deputy President of the Australian Services Union and also the President of the Community and Social Services Sector. One would think that an organiser, a deputy president of a state union and an officeholder of a state union would understand the detail of the policy, but obviously not - or is this just another example of the dishonest campaign from the Labor Party and the unions? What Ms Fran Tierney also failed to disclose is that she is a councillor for the Lane Cove Council in New South Wales. In addition to whatever salary she is getting from her union position, she is being paid over $1,000 a month as a councillor. This is hardly somebody on the minimum wage. But there is more to come -  - There is one other thing that was failed to be disclosed by this so-called battling worker. In 2001 Fran Tierney, according to the ALP web site, was their candidate for North Sydney. - I have two final things to say in conclusion. Apparently, Fran stood for the Labor Party in a previous election as well. Fran from Lane Cove reminds me of Chris from Waramanga.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know how hard he works to ensure that Medicare services are delivered to regional Australia. The Howard government does not just talk about improved Medicare services in regional areas but, through the rural health strategy, the government is spending an additional $830 million over four years delivering them. The government will be paying more than 2,000 long-serving country doctors up to $25,000 a year extra through rural retention payments. There are 1,100 additional specialist services that are being delivered in country hospitals. We are supporting more than 600 allied health professionals working with country doctors and we have placed nurses into 1,100 country practices.If you can get doctors to train in the country, they will stay in the country. This government has established 10 rural clinical schools and 10 university departments of rural health to ensure that at least 25 per cent of medical students do at least 50 per cent of their clinical training in country areas. Last Friday the government committed $7 million to establish an 11th rural clinical school, to be run by Flinders University and to be based at Alice Springs, at Katherine and at Gove. It is measures like this which are why country people trust the Howard government with their health care. There is no doubt about the Howard government: it is the farmer's best friend, it is the worker's best friend and it is the best friend that Medicare has ever had - and it has the best Prime Minister that Medicare has ever had and the best Treasurer that Medicare has ever had! Mr Speaker, if you look over there, you find that those opposite haven't got too many friends. Not even Paul Keating is their friend these days.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no. To put this into some perspective, as I have explained to the House, the inspector position is a part-time role. It is a belt and braces approach to investigations, should they tragically become necessary, into any failures that result in a terrorist attack. The clear implication behind the question is that somehow the ongoing monitoring and auditing of our aviation safety arrangements are compromised because key personnel are being pulled out. That is the clear implication. In fact, that is not the case. I want to reiterate that Mr Palmer would be available again on very short notice should we need him.I want to make the point that the ongoing work about which the member might reasonably be concerned is carried forward by the Office of Transport Security. To put it into some perspective, there are approximately 245 people there charged with those responsibilities. In fact, what the shadow minister asked about refers to two other staff members who worked part-time assisting Mr Palmer with the Rau inquiry. All expenses involved in that inquiry were paid for by DIMIA. The salary of the two officers over that period - some $14,000 - was absorbed by my department. There has been no compromise in aviation safety or the maintenance of the regime. I have to say that I believe it is mischievous, unfortunate and unhelpful for the Labor Party to continue in this vein. I do not believe there is any place for a scare campaign as opposed to legitimate and informed questioning about aviation security arrangements in this country, and I think the Leader of the Opposition could, quite frankly, adopt a bit higher a tone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question, and what a great job he is doing working with small business in his electorate. Ninety-five per cent of all businesses in Australia are small businesses, and the government's workplace relations reform will be setting up a system which is fairer, simpler and more flexible. It will reduce duplication and it will reduce red tape for small businesses. This means that small businesses will be able to employ more people, they will be able to grow their businesses and, most importantly for the 3.3 million Australians who are employed by small businesses, they can look forward to continued growth of real wages. Mr Speaker, let me share with you a comment in response to the government's reform that Mr Tony Percuoco, proprietor of Fellini restaurant on the Gold Coast, makes. He says that the unfair dismissal reforms alone will allow him to take on more full-time employees. This is just one of thousands of examples of small businesses waiting to expand their businesses.Mr Speaker, I am asked if there are any alternative views and, sadly, I can tell you that there are some alternative views for small business, and they reside with the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party have let it be known to small business that they do not support the exemption of unfair dismissal and they want to abolish the Australian workplace agreements. All that the alternative views held by the Australian Labor Party will contribute to small businesses is to hold them back, and that happens because the Australian Labor Party have no real understanding of small business and have no commitment.</DOC>

 - The government's position in relation to whaling is well known and respected internationally. We have stood up to be counted and have made it abundantly clear that we are opposed to any measures to extend the whaling arrangements. We have been vigorous critics of the Japanese scientific whaling program, which clearly goes way beyond what anyone could consider to be a matter of science. Let me say, Mr Speaker, as a representative of an electorate which has a substantial whale-watching industry - in fact, it is the home of the whale-watching industry in Australia - that there is a particular commitment and concern in my own region to ensure that the whales of the world are effectively protected and that this very important industry in Australia is also recognised and appropriately protected.The minister is currently involved in a range of activities to help underpin Australia's commitments in relation to these matters. There are a range of complex legal issues in relation to jurisdiction, concerning particularly the Antarctic territories, which make it difficult for Australia to be able to respond as comprehensively as we might wish to in some of those areas. But this government's commitment to protecting Australia's whales is resolute and determined. We have taken significant action over many years in what up until now I thought was a bipartisan spirit to protect this vital species for future generations to enjoy.</DOC>

 - The Minister for Trade said 'Port Macquarie' - that is one of the 24 locations around Australia. In fact, we will be spending around $351 million over the next five years on establishing these Australian technical colleges. They will combine academic and trade learning outcomes for students in years 11 and 12. As you know, Mr Speaker, Warrnambool, in Victoria, is another one of the locations - areas where there is a skills need and a significant youth population.In order to update the House, the request for proposal stage closed on 20 May. We received 70 proposals from around Australia. All of the 24 regions have been covered. We will be having a very close look at those over the next few weeks, or month or so, and by about mid to late July we should be able to make some announcements on the Australian technical colleges which will be opening in 2006. The state of Victoria alone made 27 of the 70 submissions.From our point of view, the Australian government's commitment to giving young people a great sense of opportunity, promoting pride, promoting excellence in trade learning outcomes from their years at school, the Australian technical colleges and the way they build strong links between business and education and training providers is going to show the way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson very much for her question. I understand that she is very keenly watching this space in relation to the support that the government is offering to people with disabilities to help them into important areas where there are real jobs. This government provides real support to people with disabilities to help them into employment. In the recent budget, the government committed $50 million to employer or demand support to help those people who have a disability and are capable of working into real jobs.We know that on the Gold Coast recently the Prime Minister launched a program, in association with the National Retail Association, to help 30 people on the disability support pension through eight weeks of training, including six days of paid work, to have real employment outcomes. The government believe that we need to support people with disability because they are a tremendous attribute to a workplace. They provide support to their fellow workers. They are trustworthy people and they are very much part of the way in which employers will engage employees into the future.Today this government also takes the opportunity to commend the National Retail Association for their dedication to this sector. We know that retail in this country represents about one in six jobs at the moment and that over the next five years 150,000 people will take up opportunities in the retail sector. This government remains a tremendous friend for those disabled people who are able to work.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is also yes. The answer to the third part of the question, which is the allegation of sustainability, is that the Leader of the Opposition has it wrong. A debt's sustainability is, in most people's experience, and most nations' experience, measured by capacity to service. The net foreign debt servicing ratio, measured as net interest-free payments as a proportion of exports, remained below 10 per cent - indeed, at 9.7 per cent - in the March quarter 2005. This is below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in 1990 and below the 1990s average of 13 per cent.Importantly, the bulk of the foreign debt accumulated - 96.8 per cent - belongs to the private sector. That is not surprising because we have paid off most of the public sector debt that the person who asked me the question left to this government. Australian net debt peaked at 19.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 and it is estimated to be just 1.9 per cent. From 19.1 to 1.9 - and this is the measure of the debt that governments run up. It peaked at 19.1 per cent in the last financial year that Labor was in office and it is going to be just 1.9 per cent of GDP in the current financial year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that the retail trade figure for April was released this morning. It showed that retail trade had fallen by half a per cent. This was led by an 11 per cent decline in department store turnover. That could well be principally in the area of clothing sales, which apparently was affected by unusually warm conditions for the month of April. Nonetheless, although one would not draw too much from a month's figure, it does appear that retail trade has softened, particularly from the peak of 2004. This is consistent with other evidence that Australian households are moderating consumption.In addition to that, the balance of payments figure was also released today for the March quarter of 2005. It showed that the current account deficit rose to $15.6 billion in the March quarter. This was because, although the trade deficit narrowed, the net income deficit increased. The March quarter does not take into account the increases in iron ore and coal contract prices that take effect in April. These prices will flow through to the June quarter and, as a consequence, the June quarter current account deficit is expected to narrow, as was forecast with the budget forecasts both for this and next year.Exports increased by one per cent in the March quarter, led by metal ores and minerals. But rural exports unfortunately fell 4.6 per cent. We are seeing the effects of drought biting into the rural sector and biting into Australia's exports. Only rain can deliver rural Australia from that drought and from the consequent decline in rural production.Motor vehicles led a two per cent increase in imports in the March quarter. That is most probably the consequence of the fact that the tariff reduced quite considerably on 1 January. Australia's net foreign debt rose from $421 billion to $424 billion, but the share of government debt, foreign debt, has fallen from 17.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent since this government was elected. The government is actually reducing its debt and reducing its foreign debt, with the private sector borrowing. If that borrowing were to go into good investment, that would add to the long-term capacity. The macro-economic conditions are much more stable now than they have been at times of other increases in the current account deficit to historical highs. Our budget is in surplus; government net debt is close to zero; unemployment is at 30-year lows; and inflation and interest rates are low by historical standards.Having said all that, we cannot afford to relax in relation to economic reform, and I particularly name two areas where we ought to focus to improve Australia's economic performance. The first is in the area of infrastructure. We need to boost Australia's ports. Our largest export is coal. Our largest exports go through Hay Point, Dalrymple Bay, where 40 ships continue to line up offshore at the Dalrymple Bay coal loading terminal. The Queensland Competition Authority, after 20 months, has finally brought down a decision. It will take two years after that 20-month delay for construction to boost production through Dalrymple Bay. I have already indicated to the House that, as far as the government is concerned, a national approach to competition authority with a national competition regulator giving timely decisions would be an enormous improvement.The second area is in relation to domestic production. There is no reform which could benefit the Australian economy more than industrial relations reform. It would boost productivity in every firm in the country and lead to higher productivity and higher wages. If the parliament can enact a new industrial relations system, that would be a great achievement for economic production in Australia.</DOC>

 - The Australian people have been watching the member for Lilley's humiliating performance for quite some time. In March 1995 -  -  - And I welcome the first question that the member for Lilley has asked since the budget. I must say that we have had some bad shadow treasurers but none is up to the record of the member for Lilley. - In March 1995, mortgage interest rates - and I covered this in my last answer - were 10.5 per cent. Today, they are 7.3 per cent. In March 1995, the unemployment rate was 8.4 per cent. Today, the unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent. As we are talking about savings - the current account represents the difference between savings and investment and consumption - compared to a budget surplus of 1.1 per cent today, in March 1995 the budget was not balanced. It was not in surplus; there was a deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP. Back in March 1995, the government was adding to foreign debt by having a deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP. Today, the government is detracting from foreign debt by having a surplus of 1.1 per cent of GDP. -  - I also make one other observation in relation to the question which was asked of the Prime Minister earlier. Back in March 1995, Australia had had its credit rating downgraded twice. Now, in May 2005, Australia has had its credit rating upgraded twice to a AAA credit rating, meaning that there is now -  - I am talking about Australia's credit rating in relation to its debt position. In March 1995, Australia had had its credit rating downgraded twice under the Labor Party. Because the government now has essentially no net debt, its credit rating has been revised upwards twice to a AAA rating. The consequence is that Australia, now AAA rated for foreign currency bonds, no longer pays any premium in relation to its interest rates, which it was paying in March 1995. This puts back into context the Prime Minister's statement: we were paying a premium for foreign debt in March 1995 because our credit had  been downgraded on two occasions.Anybody on this side of the House will know this: if you have a AAA credit rating the premium on your interest rates is a lot lower than if you have been downgraded. The consequence over those years is that the premium on foreign currency bonds has been removed as a result of the government getting its budget back in balance, reducing its net debt and getting two upgradings to a AAA rating for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest. I think all members of this House will be appalled by the fact that in the last 18 months or so, according to the United Nations, around 180,000 people may have died in Darfur as a result, directly or indirectly, of the violence that has taken place there. Last year the Australian Defence Force offered airlift support to the African Union Mission in Sudan - an offer they did not take up. In any case, there are already around 2,600 African Union personnel in Sudan helping to achieve peace. That will be expanded to 7,700 by September this year.In addition, the United Nations Security Council agreed in March to establish a 10,000-strong United Nations Mission in Sudan and to take further action against the perpetrators of the atrocities in Darfur. The Australian government strongly supports the decision to refer crimes committed in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. The government, of course, has repeatedly called upon the Security Council to take these actions, along with a number of other countries.We will contribute 15 Defence Force personnel to the UN Mission in Sudan, including air movements and logistical support personnel and military observers. That deployment has already commenced. Honourable members might be pleased to know that the contingent commander, Squadron Leader Ruth Elsley, is the first female contingent commander of an Australian contingent of this kind.Last month I announced a further contribution of $10 million in humanitarian assistance to southern Sudan. That brings the total of Australia's humanitarian assistance to Sudan over the last 12 months - most of which has gone to Darfur - to over $40 million. So the Australian government is making a contribution to trying to achieve peace in Darfur. It is very important that the international community as a whole really throws its weight behind the peace process there, because the loss of human life has been simply enormous.</DOC>

 - I have seen some reports in the media that the honourable member for Perth addresses. When Mr Joyce and, indeed, any others in the Australian community see the detail of this package, they will know that this is to the overwhelming benefit of the people of Australia. - Indeed, I am sure Mr Joyce will be referred to the comments of Commerce Queensland. I will read from their press release about these changes, which is headed 'Queensland business welcomes federal industrial relations reforms':The Queensland business community has warmly welcomed the wide ranging package of industrial relations reforms announced ... by the Prime Minister.Commerce Queensland CEO, Joe Barnewall, said that these reforms would act as a building block -  - They do not want to hear it, do they? Commerce Queensland said:... these reforms would act as a building block for business growth and higher living standards for - Australian - families.'The implementation of these landmark industrial reforms would kick start a new wave of productivity and economic growth in the State and national economies,' ...Just as we have done well for Australian families with a 14 per cent growth in real wages over the last nine years and 1.6 million extra jobs, these reforms will be for the benefit of Australian workers and their families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax, and I can tell him that one side of Australian politics supports tax cuts for every Australian on 1 July. There is now only one month to go before every Australian can have an income tax cut, if only the Australian Labor Party will get out of the way and let people have those tax cuts. Is there support for such tax cuts? It appears there is from all sorts of quarters. Senator Minchin received a copy of an email which was sent to the member for Canberra on 24 May 2005. I believe it to be a legitimate email. I will not go to the name although I have here the name of the person who sent it. The constituent writes as follows:I am finally prompted to write to my representative in the parliament of Australia as a result of my increasing dissatisfaction with representation I receive from the Australian Labor Party.This constituent says that he has always voted for the party that 'I felt had Australia's best interests at heart' and up until recently this was the ALP. But having listened to the debate in the House of Representatives regarding the coalition's proposed tax measures:I find myself in complete disbelief and for the first time a sense of anger. This is entirely due to the manipulative language used to obfuscate the truth of the debate. I am tired of hearing I am amongst Australia's wealthy and I do not deserve the tax cut being proposed by the government.Then he says this:A brief lesson in mathematics for the ALP: 10 per cent of some is some; 10 per cent of more is more. The proposed changes involved a tax cut of eight per cent for the 47 per cent bracket. The same budget proposes around 18 per cent for the lower brackets. Yes, this means more in dollar terms for me but it is a smaller relief of the total burden borne by me. I live in a moderate former government - guvvie - home in Duffy. I earn just under 90K. I have worked since 1987 and undertaken private study at my own expense to develop my career. -  - This is what he says; there is no point trying to convince me. He is a constituent of the member for Canberra. He finishes by saying this:I am sorry to advise that after 17 years the ALP has lost my support and my next vote.Let the record show that the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely unconcerned by this proposition. Apparently he is not the only person that feels that way because there were certain things published in the Australian newspaper today which we will not refer to. But a journalist did ask the member for Lilley on his way in today:Are you ... concerned about the poll today that shows ... the popularity of the Labor Party has dropped since you opposed the Budget's tax cuts?The member said:Well I'm not actually.Why is that? The journalist said:But they - the Liberal party - seem to have won over the public.The member for Lilley said he was not concerned about that. Why would he not be concerned about that? This was his answer:Well ... after the last Budget, ... the Labor Party primary vote dropped seven points.So they're not nearly as bad as they were after last year's budget! After last year's budget there was a thing called an election. I advise the Labor Party: do not be concerned - after last year's budget your popularity dropped by seven points. There is no need to worry. Your tactics are in the hands of the member for Lilley!Now there is the critical question that Australia asks today. The tax schedules are now in this House. No motion of disallowance has yet been moved. The tax schedules will go into the Senate on 14 June. If no motion of disallowance is moved, every Australian will get their tax cut. Where does the Labor Party stand on that motion of disallowance? It stands resolutely irresolute. It stands certain of its doubts. It stands certain of its indecision. It has determined not to determine a position. This is a joke. The Australian people need to know. Will they be getting their tax cuts? Will this Leader of the Opposition determine to determine determinedly his position? Will he announce that he will not disallow? Will he let that go through the Senate? Every Australian taxpayer needs to know, and the Labor Party needs to make a decision for once in its life.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is no. I remind the honourable member that, under this government, real wages in this country have gone up by 14 per cent in real terms. - I was asked whether certain stances in relation to wage adjustments were the reason why we supported a fair pay commission. I answered that by saying no, and that remains my answer. But, if we are talking about wage levels of Australian workers, I remind the opposition that real wages in this country have gone up by 14.1 per cent in real terms under this government. The other bitter pill for the Labor Party is that, under this government, the section of the Australian community which has been most advantaged by the taxation and family tax benefit system this government has introduced have been low- and middle-income families. I know it is a very bitter pill for the Labor Party, but the truth is that not only have we been great friends of the workers and great friends of Medicare -  - but this government is the best friend that low- and middle-income families have ever seen. The NATSEM survey - which I have referred to on one or two occasions in the past and, no doubt, will in the future - demonstrated very conclusively that, as a result of the tax and transfer payment system inaugurated by this government, the bottom 60 per cent of Australian families benefited, essentially through the top 40 per cent of Australian families being, in a net position, not as well off as a result of the operation of those systems. I know that is a bitter pill, because low- and middle-income families were the claimed preserve of the Australian Labor Party. The reality is that they are being better looked after by my government than they ever were by former Labor governments.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. As I mentioned at this time yesterday, the federal government has announced a significantly enhanced drought assistance package to help Australian farmers through these difficult times. There will be more generous exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies, with a revised and more generous assets test; an improved income test for the EC relief payment; additional counselling and support services; a second Envirofund round of grants to help preserve and protect the environment and our biodiversity through these dry times; and a range of other measures to support farmers as they face perhaps the worst drought in our nation's history. This is all in addition to the three-quarters of a billion dollars that the federal government has already provided to Australian farmers since this drought began.I am pleased to say there has been a very positive response to this package from the rural sector and indeed around the nation. The National Farmers Federation, for instance, says the package will deliver important assistance to more farm businesses and families. Mal Peters from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it will help ease the strain for many farmers affected by the most crippling drought to hit Australia in 100 years. AgForce says the drought package gives farmers renewed hope. John Swain from the Rural Financial Counselling Service said, 'As far as being money well spent, through my past 10 years of experience I can only see the good that comes out of it all.'Even the capital city newspapers responded positively. I was delighted to read the editorial in the Daily Telegraph which pointed out that the government's decision to extend the interest rate subsidies to farmers rather than allowing for straight cash grants is sound. They also observed that few would begrudge this $250 million package of extra drought assistance.I welcome these positive responses. Of course, there have been a couple of negative responses. The honourable  member for New England tried to talk down the importance of this package for farmers, and I think that does him no credit. The Leader of the Opposition was also trying to be critical. He observed that the interest subsidies would bring them back to the level of subsidy which applied when Labor was last in office. What he forgot to mention was that, in those days, the states paid 30 per cent of the cost of the interest subsidies, a position from which the states have significantly retreated. So it is beyond doubt that this is a package which will provide real and practical assistance to Australian farmers. I welcome the support that has been provided by industry organisations, and I am sure that the farmers of Australia are grateful for this additional support.</DOC>

 - The reality is that real wages have gone up under this government. That is the reality. The reality also is that the way in which the minimum wage is currently set involves an ambit claim by the ACTU in order to create a dispute so that the dispute can be resolved by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We believe that there is a better, more fair way of setting the minimum wage in Australia and that is why we are proposing a new fair pay commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and I can indeed reveal to her and the House that there is support from some state leaders for a national workplace relations system. Mr Bracks, the Victorian Premier, said back in 1996 that the Victorian ALP supported the concept of a single national system of industrial relations and it always has. He said:It can deliver benefits to both employees and employers by creating a uniform national framework for dispute resolution and the application of the minimum employment standards that can be more easily complied with and enforced.We agree with Mr Bracks about that.Yesterday I noted a report in the Australian that attributed some comments to the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, that he was not interested in keeping a 'boutique' state industrial relations commission. Mr Carr has, I understand, since denied these comments. This is interesting because I went back to a well-known source of comments and thought about Mr Carr - a book that has been described as 'an in-depth insider's account'. In this book I find this:He proposed that a future state Labor government should hand over to the Commonwealth state powers in business and consumer regulation, vehicle registration, distribution of freight - and, wait for it - industrial relations.Who would be doing this? None other than the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr. Indeed, it goes on to say in the book that Carr's argument was that:By combining state and federal industrial relations bodies, wages policy could be dealt with at a national level and not have to be fought out in each state jurisdiction.We agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Carr said. The only thing that seems to have changed in relation to Mr Carr is the composition of the national government. There is other support for this as well. One of the ACTU's vice presidents, Mr Richard Marles, asked this question recently:... how on earth does a small employer ... work their way through the myriad of laws and find out whether or not ... they are covered by state or federal law? It is perhaps impossible to imagine putting such employers and workers in a more complex legal situation.Mr Bracks was right; he is still right. Mr Carr was right in 1990. We believe that this is the appropriate way to go forward - to cut out the confusion, the cost and the complexity of overlapping and duplicated systems and to have one national system in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge these are serious matters which deserve to be taken seriously arising out of the story on the front page of the Australian this morning. When I became aware of the report, I asked the Office of Transport Security to secure a copy of it from Customs. I can tell the House that the report was researched in late 2003 and, so far as we are able to assess, completed in early 2004. It is important to note that at that very time the government was addressing the very issues that the report raised and they were very substantially -  - I am asked 'How?' If you refer to what happened at the end of 2003 you will see that they were very substantially addressed in the $93 million enhanced aviation security package that was announced at that time.The report raises a number of issues concerning criminality at airports. Those matters are rightly the responsibility of the Customs Service and the police. I can confirm that the report was not made available to me or to my department but - and it is worth making this point - since research for that piece of material was conducted the government has instituted a very large number of measures and it is worth recapping them. We have had the comprehensive Aviation Transport Security Act go through this place; 180 airports regulated; 170 airlines regulated; 350 transport security programs approved; the regulation of over 900 cargo agents; greater controls over access to airport secure areas; and the broadening and tightening of criteria for the issue of the aviation security identification cards - the ASICs.Since the report was researched, all 65,000 of those ASIC cards in circulation have been reissued. I want to reassure the House that, where DIMIA, the Australian Federal Police or ASIO have identified reasons why those cards should not be reissued, they have not been reissued. There are a significant number of people who sought those cards who have not had them reissued. I think that is very important to note.We have, of course, had the introduction of background checking for pilots and of hardened cockpit doors on passenger aircraft with more than 30 seats - funded by the government. We have also had the introduction of 100 per cent check bag screening on international flights, an increase in the number of airports where passenger and carry-on screening takes place, the screening of goods and persons entering airport sterile areas and an increased AFP, APS and ASIO presence at our airports. We have had the deployment of our armed air security officers on selected domestic services and international routes and the introduction of the Australian Federal Police Protective Security Liaison Officer network, explosive trace detection at domestic and international passenger screening points and antitheft devices to powered aircraft - $48 million worth of measures to increase security at regional airports. Indeed, these measures, amounting to $162 million of Commonwealth outlays - around $300 million a year by Qantas alone - and several hundred million dollars worth of new equipment, paid for by the private sector at our airports, have been implemented since the time that the research referred to in the Australian this morning was undertaken. The point that I make, which would be well taken in the House, is that they constitute a very full and comprehensive response to the issues that our authorities have been alerting us to.I want to conclude by making this point: we have not had a terrorism incident in Australia. I cannot, and no-one can, guarantee that we will not one day be the subject of a terrorism incident. But I can say this: the government, its agencies and the private sector have been and remain vigilant, as the travelling public have every right to expect we would be.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today marks the second anniversary of what is called the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is a practical but informal arrangement among countries to work together to intercept and disrupt the illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and other related materials. We are proud to be a key driver of the Proliferation Security Initiative. We have hosted two PSI meetings. We led the first successful interdiction exercise in October 2003, which was called Operation Pacific Protector, and we plan to lead a second exercise in 2006.The PSI has rapidly built up operational strength. Over 60 countries are now supporting it. Fourteen exercises have been held in Europe, Asia and North America, each time led by a different country. Fourteen more exercises are scheduled between now and the end of 2006. The PSI has scored significant successes in stopping proliferators in their tracks. In October 2003, a group of nations worked together to stop an illegal cargo of centrifuge parts for uranium enrichment which was destined for Libya. Soon after, and importantly, the Libyans agreed to end their weapons of mass destruction programs. We will continue to work with others to ensure that the PSI is successful and that it sends a strong message in our efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.I think from our point of view as a government we would have to say we were disappointed with the outcome of the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York, which I attended but which ended inconclusively. It was a great disappointment that it was not able to draw together strong conclusions on where there would be international action to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Nevertheless, I think the Proliferation Security Initiative is working well. It has got strong international support and it is proving to be quite effective.</DOC>

 - In general terms it alerted Customs officials to what I think was obvious: that in the question of international terrorism the chance for incidents at our major airports was a very real one and had to be taken seriously. Yes, it did, in a generic sense. As I outlined in my earlier answer, that has been very comprehensively responded to. Let us get the timing of this right. The research for this was done during 2003, as best as we can establish, and finalised in early 2004, by which time we had released our enhanced Response to Aviation Security package.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question, and I know how concerned he is to ensure better health outcomes for Indigenous people. When it comes to reconciliation the right rhetoric is important, but it is not as important as the right result. Indigenous specific health spending has increased from just over $100 million in 1996 to $350 million in the coming financial year. That is a 150 per cent real increase. As a result, immunisation rates in remote Indigenous communities are now close to 100 per cent. There are still too few Indigenous doctors, but there are 50 per cent more than in 1996. There are still too few Indigenous nurses, but there are 30 per cent more than in 1996.In Townsville, Indigenous peri-natal mortality is down by over 50 per cent. In some Northern Territory communities, peri-natal mortality is down by over 400 per cent. Since the 1970s, Indigenous death rates in the Northern Territory from communicable diseases are down by over 60 per cent, and deaths from trauma are down over 30 per cent. Since 1997 there has been a 74 per cent increase in the number of healthcare episodes delivered by Aboriginal medical services. As well, as a result of the words and inspiration of people like Noel Pearson, more Indigenous communities are taking greater responsibility for their own health. There is still, I am afraid, a long way to go, there is no room for complacency on any measure, but we owe it to the Indigenous people of Australia to focus on good news as well as bad news as we work together to get even better outcomes in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - Plainly, all of the machinery, procedures and so forth that we have put in place in our airports since 11 September 2001 have been aimed at tackling the problem of terrorism and security. In that sense, I have to say that a lot of the equipment we use is designed to screen baggage and enable us to pick up things like bombs - through trace detection and that sort of thing. That is the first point I would make.There are some things - drugs, for example - that screening equipment will not pick up. That is a separate issue which must be considered as part of our approach to smuggling and policing. I in no sense seek to evade any of our responsibilities when I say that of course those are Customs and policing matters. Where we have been able to combine our approach sensibly, we have done so. But, in particular, what I really want to draw to the attention of the House is that plainly there has to be a degree of trust in all of this. The first point I want to make -  -  - Those opposite would say that all baggage handlers and all people with ASIC cards should be assumed to be criminally inclined - is that correct? Perhaps we should move on to the pilots. Who else should we automatically assume is criminally inclined? I reiterate the point that I made earlier: 65,000 ASIC cards have been reissued following consideration by DIMIA, the AFP and ASIO of background investigations into anything that might suggest an inclination or tendency towards politically motivated violence. That is separate to the question of employers and police then applying for fit and proper person status for people to be employed - as the Minister for Justice and Customs this morning made plain. There are references here to people with criminal backgrounds. You have to consider the nature of those criminal backgrounds - whether people have paid their dues to society, whether it is a traffic offence or whether it is something more serious. But I want to assure the House that, wherever there has been any suggestion of a tendency towards politically motivated violence, they have not got their cards. They are not going anywhere near the airports. I think it is very important that we acknowledge that.In relation to Mr Palmer, as I have repeatedly said here, he is not the person who takes forward the management of our aviation and other transport security policies. He was put there as a belts and braces addition at my suggestion so that we would have a legitimate and instantly usable - if I can use that term - person to take up an investigation if, God forbid, we should have a terrorism incident in Australia. I make this observation: if I had not put forward the idea and if we had not done it, these questions would never have been asked - because, rightly, the Labor Party would have recognised that the Office of Transport Security is the body responsible for taking forward our very extensive transport security regime.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to talk about the Job Network - and you can hear the interjections already from the other side, because the Labor Party do not like the Job Network. They do not like the fact that the government has pushed unemployment down to 5.1 per cent. There is no better recognition than in the electorate of Canning of how successful the programs of the Howard government have been in helping people back into work. The unemployment rate in Canning was 9.1 per cent when this government came into power in 1996, and it is now at 6.2 per cent. Over the last 12 months, 657,800 places under the Job Network system have put unemployed people into work. Importantly, at the same time there have been about 272,000 long-term unemployed people who have been put into jobs to improve their outcomes in life and to lift their self-esteem and self-confidence.The government are determined to put more people back into work. We know that over the last 12 months, under the Job Network, 19,830 sole parents were put into work. The government are determined to do more. So we say to the Labor Party: get out of the way. Make sure that you look at the Job Network system as something that has been incredibly successful. We know that under the Working Nation program of the Labor Party job placements cost, on average, $12,800. Under this government, placements have fallen by 75 per cent to just over $3,000 for each placement. The government are determined to push unemployment lower. We are determined to get unemployed people back into work, and the Labor Party should realise that. Get out of the way and support unemployed Australians.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as I thought I had made plain to the House, I did not become aware of the report until this morning. - I thought I made that plain. You weren't listening. -  - At the beginning of my remarks I said I asked my department to go and find a copy of it from Customs. It was not provided to me. It was not provided to the Minister for Justice and Customs. It was an internal report, a speculative report, that was intended for Customs use and consideration. I reiterate the remarks that I made earlier that the claims that it makes go back quite a while. The issues raised in it are precisely the reason that we took the action that we took in the enhanced aviation security package, including - and I will reiterate the points made here - the reissuing of the ASIC cards. We wanted to make certain that we did not have people who might have been inclined to engage in politically motivated violence working in our airports. Let me spell it out more basically yet again: that is why we said that everyone who had an airport security identification card must subject themselves to a thorough background check again by the Australian Federal Police, by DIMIA and by ASIO. On that basis the cards have been reissued to those that we deemed do not pose a security risk. I do not think I can spell it out much more clearly than that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey. In fact, since 1996 there have been 2,270 new apprentices that have taken on the job in training. It is a 164 per cent increase since 1996. In the last 12 months we have just seen so many people taking up the opportunities. This government is backing workers. There is no doubt about it. The Tools for your Trade initiative is a $120.2 million initiative over four years. For new apprentices starting after 1 July next - a big day, 1 July - if they are in a skill-needs trade they will be eligible to receive an $800 tool kit. That is after their first three months. That will give them an enormous kick-start, along with some tax cuts in their particular chosen career. Employers will in fact receive the tool kits from the government appointed contractor. They will make that tool kit available to the new apprentice in time after they have completed a further six months. Some 34,000 new apprentices a year will benefit - people from the metal trades, the electrical trades, carpenters and so forth. We have started the request for tender process and are looking forward to that.In addition to the tool kits, we are providing the Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship. That is $106 million over the next four years. There will be two $500 payments - that is a total of $1,000 - at the successful completion of each of the first and second years, and that will be assisting around 60,000 new apprentices each year, for new apprentices who have started after 1 July 2004. And of course some apprentices will be able to get both, which means some $1,800 worth of initiatives and incentives to assist apprentices in the first couple of years, coming from this government after 1 July.Why are the Australian Labor Party offering little or nothing in response? They have lost their way. We have done some research. We have found that the member for Hunter is the only member of the Australian Labor Party frontbench who has actually got a trade qualification - the only one. In fact, the last Labor leader who actually served an apprenticeship was almost a century ago. John Curtin was apprenticed as a printer.</DOC>

 - As I understand it, Ms Corby was arrested in October 2004. I think I am right in saying that. So the report, you are telling me, was produced during the year but earlier than that. It was an internal report of the Australian Customs Service. So if you are trying to make a party political point here, which I suspect you might be, which is a little disappointing -  -  - Of course it is outrageous, isn't it, to even mention that you are trying to. It is perfectly obvious you are trying to. - The point I would make is exactly that of the Deputy Prime Minister: this was an internal working document of the Australian Customs Service. None of you saw it, nor did I and nor did the Deputy Prime Minister. -  - Now, now - stop shouting! It relates to information which I understand was collected in September, October, November - that sort of time frame - in 2003. I understand Ms Corby was arrested in October 2004. Cheap party politics, mate!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his very active participation in promoting tourism in regional Australia. Our $73 billion tourist industry employs more than half a million Australians and, significantly, more than 200,000 in regional Australia. Forty-eight cents out of every tourism dollar is spent in regional Australia. The government understands the importance of this. Through Tourism Australia, we support tourist events like the Great Outback Cattle Drive from Birdsville in Queensland to Marree in South Australia. The impact for small business in regional communities can be seen, for example, at the Birdsville Hotel, which 20 years ago employed three people. Today it employs 17 people and at high season it employs 30 people.Another example is the Bedourie Oasis caravan park. Fifteen years ago, the owner and his wife would open for three hours a day and for one hour on Sundays. Today they open seven days a week and they have seven full-time employees. That is very significant. I know that the member for Ballarat will be interested in this, because her region received $500,000 through the Australian Tourism Development Program to promote tourism. The member for Lingiari would also be supportive, because desert tourism has been promoted to the tune of $220,000. This government has a very firm commitment to promoting tourism right across Australia, because we understand the significance to regional communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and point out that, as a proportion of the economy, foreign debt actually fell yesterday, which means the premise of his question is completely wrong. The Leader of the Opposition is running off a story in today's Australian with credit rating agency Standard and Poor's. If he had read the full report he would know that the spokesman from Standard and Poor's said that, with the strength of its government finances and with nearly all its foreign debt held by the private sector, Australia gives reassurance to international lenders and its government has the capacity to support the private sector if there are any problems. That says precisely what I said yesterday - this government, almost alone amongst the economies of the developed world, has a budget surplus.In his sotto voce interjections the Leader of the Opposition says this is complacent. No, it is not complacent to run a budget surplus. Let me tell you what is complacent. It is complacent to have a finance minister who has a deficit of $10 billion, or nearly three per cent. That is what complacent is. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of his own record when he was finance minister. Almost alone amongst the developed economies of the world, the Australian government runs a budget surplus. On projections in the budget, it will have net debt to 0.7 per cent of GDP by the end of the next financial year. That means that the Commonwealth government will be carrying nearly no debt. The OECD average is around 40 to 50 per cent, putting Australia in a very strong position - a point that was noted by Standard and Poor's.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question, and I can tell him that the national accounts released today for the March quarter show that the economy rebounded in the March quarter, growing at 0.7 per cent. That comes off a lower than expected growth rate, which was revised up to 0.3 per cent for the December quarter, and means that, through the year, the Australian economy has grown at 1.9 per cent.Although consumption remains solid at 3.4 per cent, it is in fact lower than it was last year, which shows a moderation in consumption. The dwelling sector continues to experience a mild downturn, with dwelling investment falling 3.8 per cent through the year. This is not unwelcome. I have said on a number of occasions that the kinds of price rises we were seeing in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were unsustainable and that the government would welcome a moderation in the housing sector. We see clear evidence that this is now occurring. Business investment continues to be supported by strong profit growth. The profit share of the economy is at nearly an all-time record - I think it is within 0.1 per cent of the all-time record.The worrying part of the national accounts is the rural sector. It is clear that farm incomes have not returned to where they were before the 2002-03 drought. We had the fourth quarter of downturn, and agricultural production is 16.1 per cent lower through the year. I am sure that those in rural Australia know the heartbreak that is occurring at the moment, particularly on the east coast. We are now seeing that in agricultural production feeding through to the national accounts. But, overall, we have a rebounding economy with low inflation, good business investment, unemployment at 30-year lows, interest rate lows, a budget in surplus and the prospect of the Commonwealth freeing itself from net debt in 2005-06. We should not be complacent about this. We need to continue economic reform in this country. As I have said on a number of occasions, no economic reform is more important to Australia than labour market reform. This parliament has the opportunity to accomplish it, and we should accomplish it.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. If the current account were the cause of domestic home mortgage interest rates, why would they today be 7.3 per cent when under the Labor Party they were 17 per cent? Why would they today be 7.3 per cent when under the Australian Labor Party they were 17 per cent? Why would they today be 7.3 per cent when at the time the government was elected they were 10.5 per cent? - Let me make this point: there is one clear difference between now and 1996. It is this: in 1996 the budget was in deficit nearly three per cent of GDP and today it is in surplus. In 1996 Australia owed $96 billion and by 2005-06 we could have that as low as $6 billion. This is the government that took $96 billion of Labor Party debt and will retire $90 million of it -  - forever taking that load off future Australians. Let me make this final point: all other things being equal, if a government is borrowing, it is driving up interest rates; if a government is saving, it is driving down interest rates. When Labor was in office Labor was borrowing and driving up interest rates. Interest rates peaked at 17 per cent and in 1996 they were 10.5 per cent. This government has not borrowed a dollar in net terms since 1996 and by paying off $90 billion of Labor Party debt this government has put downward pressure on interest rates, which are now at 7.3 per cent, a level which was unheard of under the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. As a recently elected member he, along with the other members on this side of the House, is supporting a tax cut for every Australian on 1 July, and that is a month away. There is no reason why within a month every Australian cannot have an income tax cut - except for one person. One person stands between now and every Australian's income tax cut on 1 July, and it is the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, I regret to inform the House.The schedules which deliver these income tax cuts were tabled in this House last Thursday. Thursday has passed, Monday has passed, Tuesday has passed and Wednesday has passed and the Labor Party is yet to announce whether it will be moving disallowance. They will be tabled as soon as the Senate sits on 14 June. If the Labor Party does not disallow then every Australian will have their tax cut. But the Australian Labor Party, I regret to inform the House, still refuses to disclose to Australian business whether it intends to proceed with its sabotage attempt on these tax cuts.I have come into possession of a letter from MYOB to the member for Lilley dated 31 May 2005. MYOB is a provider of software that is used by a very large proportion of Australian small businesses to do their payrolls. This letter reads as follows:As you know, the ATO recently responded to a looming crisis for small business by gaining approval for the release of two tax tables. The fact remains that releasing two schedules to the business community is far from ideal. Businesses who insert the MYOB payroll upgrade will automatically install the tax tables approved from the 2004 budget. They will then need to manually override this automatic process and insert the password to access the 2005 tables should they be approved.I must emphasise this is a solution of last resort for our customers. In our experience accurate payment of employees is a role business owners take seriously. It is highly sensitive. Mass frustration will be felt not only by business but by their 1.5 million employees if this cannot be worked out. MYOB begins producing upgrades for our customers on 6 June - Listen to this: today is 1 June - MYOB begins producing upgrade CDs for our customers on 6 June. Unless the ATO is in a position to authorise delivery by this date we cannot make the 2005 tax tables the default option. This is the last chance for all involved to eliminate imminent confusion for small business owners around the nation - Listen to this - I implore you to take the required steps to avert an unnecessary and far reaching quandary.This is from MYOB. - I will table it; of course I will table it. This is the organisation that is advising small businesses on their payrolls. MYOB says that unless the Labor Party announces by 6 June - today is 1 June - there will be, in its words, 'a looming crisis for small business'. Those schedules are in the House. If the Labor Party wants to disallow them it can move in this House today to disallow them. It will not succeed but at least we will know where the Labor Party stands on this issue.I say this to the members of the Labor Party backbench, now held hostage by the member for Lilley and his failed strategy: Labor lost the last election because it did not understand the economy and it did not understand business. The argument which the member for Lilley and his compatriot the member for Perth put forward as to why they should be entrusted with economic policy on behalf of the opposition, rather than the member for Lalor, was that they could build responsibility and relationships with business. They said they could put aside Labor's untrustworthiness on economic issues.Today, as their first step, they are holding to ransom 850,000 Australian businesses. I want to say this: do not let it ever be said that the Labor Party can build a relationship with business when it engages in a stunt like this. MYOB is writing to the member for Lilley asking him to avoid a looming crisis. All he has to do is walk to that despatch box and say: 'We will not hold them to ransom. We will let businesses get on with employment. We will give employees their tax cuts. We the Labor Party have turned over a new leaf. We will try and show some understanding.' Until they do that - Labor do not understand business - Labor will never be trusted by business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The first thing I can say to Australia's universities is that had there been a change of government last year they would have lost $1.4 billion over the next four years. The second thing is that the responsibility of those of us in government is to do what is right for Australia. It is critically important that we invest an additional $11 billion in universities over the next 10 years, which is what this government is committed to doing. But before we hand over that hard-earned taxpayers' money we are saying that two things will happen in universities. The first is that there will be changes to the way in which they are governed and administered, and I thank the states and territories for their cooperation in reforming their enabling acts in that regard. The second thing is that the working arrangements in Australian universities and TAFEs should be no different from those enjoyed by working Australians right throughout the country.The last bastion for industrial relations reform exists in Australia's TAFEs and universities. Just so it is absolutely clear to the average Australian what the government requires, before an extra $838 million is given over three years to Australia's universities we are requiring that the university management will offer to its employees an Australian workplace agreement and that every employee in a university or a TAFE should be free to join and be represented by a union - if they want to. These are intelligent, educated people. If they want to, they should have the right to say that they do not want to negotiate an individual agreement, and they should only have a third party involved in industrial relations negotiations in relation to their working arrangements if they want them involved. There is nothing so remarkable about that. The average, everyday Australian would ask, 'Why is it that these people have been so cloistered for so long?' and one of the reasons is they have been protected by the people right across the benches of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and tell the House that the Australian delegation, with officials from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department, will be in Jakarta next week to discuss a bilateral treaty on the transfer of prisoners between Australia and Indonesia. We have arrangements with a range of states of this kind. We have 57 countries we have arrangements with through the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and we have recently finalised a bilateral agreement with Thailand. It is important to recognise that, in the case of the other agreements we have, transfer of prisoner arrangements allow for a citizen convicted of a crime overseas to serve their sentence in Australia. They do not permit the offender to be released on return to Australia. Such agreements also require that all appeals processes must be exhausted before a transfer can be considered.Indonesia currently does not have any bilateral prisoner transfer treaties, not with any other state, so it is important to recognise that these negotiations may be complicated and it may take some time to reach agreement. But it also worth remembering that, once that agreement is reached, assuming it is, between the Australian and Indonesian governments, it is likely that that agreement will require some amendments to legislation, including in Indonesia, and it is certain that that agreement would have to be ratified by the Indonesian parliament. I say that because I know a lot of people in Australia are upset about the Corby verdict. But I would say this: to continually attack Indonesia and denigrate its institutions and leaders will build up a good deal of anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia and it will make it very difficult to conclude agreements of this kind, particularly through public institutions like the Indonesian parliament.I am aware that today the Australian Federal Police and the ACT Fire Brigade are investigating a possible suspicious package that was received this morning by the Indonesian embassy. The embassy has been closed. It is surrounded by fire engines and other emergency services equipment. This is a matter of great concern and it is the sort of thing that is very unhelpful, to say the least. I make the point that as a government we condemn this sort of behaviour, we condemn this sort of abuse and we would urge people who are concerned about Schapelle Corby to ensure they put their energies into supporting the legal defence team and not put their energies into abuse and denigration of Indonesia, its institutions and its leaders and not to undertake these sorts of activities which, at least, are potentially threatening to Indonesian staff working here in Australia.</DOC>

 - You miss Keating, don't you! - What is a laughing matter is the way the opposition do not provide the full quote. What I actually did was make it perfectly clear in the interviews that I did on this subject that this was according to the advice I had been given by my department. It might come as an enormous surprise to the Labor Party, but bearing in mind that my department receives in Canberra 140,000 cables a year plus infinite emails I personally do not read every single piece of material that comes into my department. Actually, no minister since January 1901 ever has done. - The fact is that I provided the information that had been provided to me in a written submission from my department at that time. I have asked my department to scour through their files and see whether they could find anything, and as they have found two or three pieces of information they have passed them on to the Palmer inquiry. There is nothing less and nothing more to it than that. - But to try to sex up a story like this as though -  - somebody has done something terribly wrong, or DFAT were involved in some sort of conspiracy to send Vivian Alvarez Solon back to the Philippines - come on; grow up.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question and can indicate to him that the response from business groups, including those many small businesses that operate in the electorate of the member for Tangney, has been overwhelmingly positive. We have also seen this deliberately misleading campaign run by the ALP and the ACTU against these reforms. Last Friday, as I told the parliament recently, we had Fran from Lane Cove - a supposed battler, who pretended to be on the minimum wage. Then, last Sunday, the ACTU released the results of a survey which showed apparent opposition to the reforms. There are some interesting things about this survey. The first thing is that the reforms were announced on 26 May. The survey was conducted from 23 to 26 May. So this was a survey showing results about reforms that had not yet been announced.One will also notice from the ACTU's press release that the questionnaire used in the survey was developed by a firm called Essential Research. Essential Research is a business name for a company by the name of Essential Media Communications - EMC Pty Ltd. I looked into this a bit further, and what I discovered was that EMC in Victoria operates out of a building in Carlton which is also occupied by the Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union. This union group includes the well-known Electrical Trades Union and such well-known characters as Dean Mighell. In Sydney, EMC operates out of a building in Sussex Street - the same building that is occupied by not just the Labor Council of New South Wales but also the New South Wales Labor Party. A search of the ASIC database reveals that EMC is owned and operated by four people. One of these people formerly worked for three unions: the ANF, the FSU and the AEU. Two of them previously worked as media officers for the Victorian Trades Hall Council; one of them, Mr Lewis, is currently a media officer for the Labor Council of New South Wales; and all four are shareholders of a company by the name of Auspoll Pty Ltd, which has been accused in the past of push polling for the Victorian ALP.In addition to this, EMC - the company that has conducted this survey - has donated money to the Australian Labor Party, it has worked on a number of ALP campaigns and it has received over $100,000 in consultancies from the Bracks Labor government. I invite members to go to EMC's web site. They can find it at www.essentialmedia.com.au. If they are looking for a job, they will find this job description for a job which is currently going for a journalist/media relations person - someone, according to the job ad, who has demonstrated 'a commitment' to social campaigning. The job ad also says:You will also have the opportunity to learn strategic skills including researching attitudes into social issues and developing long-term media strategies to shift public opinion. -  - Last week we said that the ALP and the ACTU would engage in a misleading campaign about the changes that this government proposes. What we have seen over the last few days is clear evidence of that misleading campaign.</DOC>

 - The mock indignation is quite alarming. Actually we have set the record straight, I would have thought, because -  - You are still here too, are you? They are jabbering away over there in opposition, shouting away day in and day out. If I may be permitted to answer the question - oh no, I may not. - He seems to have lost his temper a bit today. I would have thought, bearing in mind the two questions the shadow minister has asked, that it is kind of obvious that we have made the material available. The letter from the deputy secretary of the department of immigration was actually cleared with me. It was on my desk there, I read it and I said, 'Yes, that's absolutely fine, and that letter can go out.' The opposition has got hold of it - new conspiracy theory, abuse, denigration. Look, honestly you cannot take these guys seriously. - As I was saying, this material has been passed to the Palmer inquiry. All of that will be looked into by the Palmer inquiry and when the Palmer inquiry reports - we are not doing the Palmer inquiry here; the Palmer inquiry is being done by Mick Palmer - and when it is complete even the member for Griffith will be able to read it.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Riverina, like all other representatives of rural electorates in Australia, is receiving positive feedback about the government's $250 million boost to exceptional circumstances assistance. It has certainly been widely appreciated by rural and regional communities. It provides improved access to EC business support, a more generous assets test for the relief payment and better payments for those people who are eligible to receive this support. But the package also includes significant additional help for people in rural communities - $4 million towards the family relationships program, $3 million to help the CWA with their aid program to families urgently in need and $2 million to boost financial counselling services.Another important part of the announcement that was made by the Prime Minister earlier this week was the commitment of $1 million a year to continue our Young People in Rural Industries Program. That is a very important initiative that has now been in operation for a few years to support young people who have in mind a career in agriculture, to help support them to develop the skills that they need to be leaders in rural communities into the future. I am delighted to welcome in the gallery today 40 participants in the fifth Young Rural Leaders Course, which is being held in Canberra at the present time. These are some of the young people whom we can expect to lead rural industry organisations in the years ahead.I have no doubt that through this program and some of the other elements of our youth support arrangements, such as the study scholarships and the capacity to participate in projects to benefit their industry around the world, we will have a generation of young people who can drive agriculture forward. I think that young people can make a contribution to agricultural policy now. It is not just a matter for the future. They can provide a lot of the innovation and the good ideas to help build a progressive rural sector. For that reason, two young people have been included in the reference group that is looking at rural policy at the present time. In September I will convene a national forum of rural young people to talk about issues of significance and to help plan a future for agriculture in this country.Next week is Future Farmers Week. I hope this will provide an opportunity for people to think about the contribution that young people are already making towards vibrant rural communities and about what more can be done to assist them to achieve their objectives. Our investment in drought relief is very much an investment in the future of farming. Certainly it will provide an opportunity for the next generation to achieve their objectives.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I will investigate that. I cannot tell you offhand, because I made those representations in September 2002. I was on my way to Nigeria for a meeting of the then Commonwealth of Nations troika, to meet the President of Nigeria and the President of South Africa to talk about Zimbabwe. I stopped off at the Maldives - I am going on recollection here - and I met the president. I will find out. Because there is a context to this, I make the point that, as I recall it, the man's situation was that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and it seemed appropriate that these representations be made. Lest anybody think that it is odd to make representations after all avenues of appeal against the death penalty have been exhausted, it is quite common for the government of this country - through me, the foreign minister or the Governor-General on advice - to make representations for a pardon.Without labouring the point, because I do not think it is constructive, you do these things after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. To talk about doing them in other circumstances is clearly counterproductive. If I have got the dates wrong, I will freely acknowledge that, but that is my recollection of that case. I thought what I did was proper. From recollection, when I was asked the question last night on Lateline, I said that representation had been made by the man's family. I will find out whether that is correct but, whether it was by his family, his friends or somebody else, not a lot turns on that. I think what turns on it is that he had exhausted all avenues of appeal and I properly made representations. I stand by that. Is the opposition suggesting I should not have done it?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and for the way in which she goes about promoting the very high performance of the Illawong Primary School in her electorate. Of all of the things that parents of the 3.3 million children in Australian schools want, the two that are most important to parents are standards and values. For the very first time, before this government hands over $33 billion of taxpayers' money for the next four years to all government and non-government schools throughout the country, the conditions of that funding will have to be met. One of the conditions is that there will be plain language reports to parents. Parents are sick and tired of getting politically neutered reports from schools about the performance of their children, written in language that they cannot understand. From next year, it will be a government requirement for all Australian school reports, however information is reported to parents, to be reported in A, B, C, D and E. Parents can expect know which 25 per cent, or which one-quarter of the class, their child falls in.I was quite disturbed today when I read in the Daily Telegraph a report of what is happening in New South Wales government schools. It seems that the only people in the state of New South Wales that cannot find out how state schools are performing in that state are parents. It seems that the ideological bureaucrats in the education department, the hardworking public servants, the principals, the teachers unions and just about everybody else in the state of New South Wales know how every school is performing, but one group of people who are apparently cut out of the equation are the parents. The Daily Telegraph said:In some government agencies, operatives work in secret environments where information is shared on a 'need-to-know' basis and confidentiality may mean the difference between life and death. We think of organisations such as ASIO and ASIS or, internationally, Mi5, CIA and KGB.That is precisely the culture in New South Wales government schools. I say to the member for Hughes, to all members here and to the parents of Australia that conditions of funding for Australian schools by the Howard government will include a requirement for the performance of the school to be published.A school's performance in literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7 and teacher attendance at school will be available to parents in the broader community - one state minister asked, 'What's a teacher's attendance at school got to do with the education of children?' - as well as teacher retention rates, student attendance rates, median year 10 and year 12 results, the value added score that the school delivers and the career leaver destinations. This government is determined to see that Australian schools have high, nationally consistent standards, that the performance of the school will be known to the broader community, that parents will not be treated as mushrooms by state education departments and that parents and their children will be at the centre of the educational experience.</DOC>

 - Firstly, let me say in relation to the member for Griffith, I guess he got off to a bad start by not providing the full quote of what I said on the Lateline program. If you are going to engage in debate in this House you need to make sure that you are putting forward your case with a bit of integrity, not misquoting people deliberately. Secondly, I make the point that material has been referred to Mick Palmer and his inquiry in relation to Ms Alvarez. He is handling that issue and, as I understand it - and you can check with the immigration minister - he is looking into her case. But in terms of further cases, which he does not believe he has time to deal with, he is going to make recommendations for how they should be dealt with.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and for her strong support for the Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research at Westmead Hospital in Western Sydney. With four Nobel prize winners in medicine, Australia has always punched well above its weight in health and medical research. Aspro, penicillin, the heart pacemaker, the ultrasound scanner and the bionic ear were all originally developed by Australians. Access Economics has concluded that every one dollar spent on medical research generates $5 in economic benefits.The Howard government has increased health and medical research spending from $127 million in 1996 to $487 million this year. In the recent election campaign we committed an additional $85 million to medical research, principally in cancer and diabetes. There is not nearly enough private money going into medical research. That is why we have commissioned a task force to look into how we can achieve greater commercialisation of our research, but our research output is still twice the OECD average. Good research ultimately translates into better clinical practice. And that is why -  -  - They've got it over there! - the money we have spent on medical research makes the Howard government most definitely the best friend Medicare has ever had, the best Prime Minister Medicare has ever known and the best Treasurer Medicare has ever known, and I want to thank them for their support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member opposite for his question because it gives me the opportunity to take the objective assessment of the security of our airports out of the political realm and draw people's attention to independent experts who know more about this than the Labor Party - and, dare I say it, perhaps a little bit more than one or two people in the media - and are able to offer an objective opinion.This morning on Radio National Fran Kelly introduced what she described as a 'leading international security analyst' and said that that person had largely dismissed a classified Australian Customs report which claims that Sydney airport is a security shambles. That person is Mr Neil Fergus. Mr Neil Fergus ran the intelligence unit for the Sydney Olympics, and I think it would be said that the world looked on at the way in which the whole thing was conducted and congratulated Australia for its security arrangements. He works internationally as a consultant with his firm, Intelligent Risks. That consulting firm has carried out security analysis for at least 40 major international airports worldwide. That is not a bad record. He says that, while no airport can ever be 100 per cent security tight - a point that I acknowledged in this place yesterday - Australia's comes fairly close. He said:I am hard-stretched to think of another airport internationally that is of a similar standard to Sydney or Melbourne in relation to these matters.In the current climate, where there is always the risk of sensationalism and politicisation of aviation security, I think it is relevant to hear from a respected international observer.I would furthermore note that the United States transport security agency reviewed antiterrorism arrangements at Sydney airport last year and gave it a clean bill of health. Later this year ICAO will undertake another audit at Sydney airport. Because I think it is important, in the context of community concerns, to address those issues that might be worrying people and to do so in a way that is objective and transparent, I indicated this morning on the John Laws program that I intend to engage an internationally respected aviation security expert to provide us with a comprehensive overview of security arrangements at our airports over coming weeks. I do not believe that anything could be more transparent or more reasonable than that.Yesterday in this place I charged the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister, who asked the question with what I believe is an entirely legitimate point, that, while ever they come into this place ahead of seeking the briefings that we freely offer on aviation security they are guilty of the charge that they seek to politicise rather than to address security issues. Yesterday, after question time and after the MPI when they said they did not want a briefing, they wrote to me saying that they do want one. I am glad about that. We have set it up for four o'clock this afternoon. Everyone who could be relevant to this will be there, including Customs, and I am awaiting an indication from the shadow minister and Leader of the Opposition as to whether they will actually take up that offer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and his ongoing interest and involvement in supporting the resources sector. It is a sector that this financial year alone will export some $67 billion worth of exports for this country. According to ABARE, next financial year its exports will be worth some $81 billion. Today's export infrastructure task force report sets out a plan to ensure that Australia maximises every export opportunity available to it. I was particularly pleased to note recommendation No. 4 of the task force report. This recommendation provides for a maximum six-month period for regulatory decisions concerning export infrastructure. I hope the Premier of Queensland, Mr Peter Beattie, is listening to that because, under Peter Beattie's watch, we saw the disgraceful situation where Dalrymple Bay choked -  - while the regulator in Queensland took 20 months to make a decision on whether or not the port could expand. Mr Beattie's comments in the media today where he has rejected a nationally coordinated approach to infrastructure challenges are simply hopeless. In the same article he acknowledges there is a problem, but he refuses to be part of the solution.I am asked if I am aware of alternative policies. Not from the opposition frontbench I am not. There is complete silence on infrastructure from the frontbench, but there is hope. The shadow parliamentary secretary for infrastructure, after his visit to Dalrymple Bay, had this to say. I hope everyone listens to these words:... the one thing that consistently comes up is the need for a coordinated, national approach to the country's infrastructure ...I could not agree more. The member for Oxley should take the time to coordinate the approach of the Labor Party, particularly in Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question in relation to the Customs report. I want to make a couple of points about that. The Chief Executive Officer of Customs has made a statement - and I draw the member's attention to that - in which he confirmed that an internal report assessing potential risks at Sydney international airport had not been circulated to ministers or to any agency outside of Customs at the time. He said that the document reported in yesterday's Australian newspaper was an assessment of potential high-risk areas and employee groups that was carried out in late 2003 and completed in early 2004, confirming what I said in this place yesterday that the research was carried out at a time when we were indeed responding -  - I think that is relevant in the sense that there have been repeated claims that this is a more recent report of September of last year. The work done, as is now confirmed by the head of Customs, was earlier and the issues raised in that report, I believe, have been comprehensively responded to. Indeed, in the press release, the head of Customs, Mr Lionel Woodward, indicates that they have responded in the areas where Customs was advised that they ought to respond. The Leader of the Opposition will have the chance, if he wants to take us up on the offer of a briefing, to pursue Mr Woodward himself on why the report was not taken further.On the claim overnight in relation to an individual at Sydney airport with a previous drugs conviction, I am advised at this point in time - and I seek to make the point clear that I am advised and I can only report to the best of my knowledge - that there are potentially two individuals who might have fitted that category. One no longer has an ASIC. The other does. It relates to an offence committed in about 1980. The individual involved served his time and a number of years lapsed, resulting in that conviction having been spent. In those circumstances, under state and Commonwealth law - as I think the Leader of the Opposition and, I hope, the shadow minister who asked the former question would know - their previous misdemeanours must be overlooked. They cannot be used to discriminate against people in the workplace.I think the Leader of the Opposition tacitly acknowledged this morning that there are very real issues here that go to the heart of our justice system and the way in which we regard people who have served time for misdemeanours. I think the point ought to be made that ASICs are, if you like, reissued every two years. If there are further issues, and I think there are some that ought to be taken into account in the future, I make this point: it might actually require the state and the Commonwealth governments to amend their legislation. In those circumstances, I pose this question now to the Leader of the Opposition: can we look forward to support from the union movement and from the Labor Party if it becomes necessary to change that legislation?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question because, like many of us, he is acutely aware of the sacrifices and commitment of emergency volunteers in protecting the lives and homes of people, particularly in bushfire prone areas. The government has taken major steps in delivering on its election commitment to support volunteers and local councils involved in emergency management across Australia.Following extensive consultation, today I have released the guidelines for two new funding programs under the government's $49 million Working Together to Manage Emergencies initiative. The funding available in this program will include $33 million under the local grant scheme, and that assists local councils to take a strategic approach to disaster management by developing risk management and community safety strategies. There is also a $16 million national volunteer support fund to provide grants directly to volunteer organisations working at the front-line of emergency management to assist with training, equipment and recruitment.The new funding programs will be managed by Emergency Management Australia. More information, including the guidelines, is now available from the EMA web site. Applications for the first round close on 29 July. I would simply say that this practical support from the government demonstrates the value that we place on local governments and volunteers in building capacity in our community to respond to emergencies of all types. I am sure that members will join with me in encouraging hardworking emergency volunteer organisations and councils committed to keeping our communities safe to see how these initiatives can help them in their very important work.</DOC>

 - The honourable member has referred to what will be a relatively small group of people who are in their second or third year of EC declaration and who have already claimed an interest subsidy and received a 50 per cent subsidy according to the old guidelines. I can confirm to the House that those people will be entitled to a supplement, so they will receive an extra 30 per cent interest subsidy under the arrangements that the Prime Minister announced earlier this week. I will need to prepare for each of the states a new set of guidelines so that they are able to administer the new arrangements under the more generous conditions. Naturally, that has not been completed as yet, but that will be done as quickly as possible so that any doubt can be removed in the minds of those who are administering the scheme. But I can confirm to all members in the House that that small number of people who have received a 50 per cent payment in the second and third year are eligible for a top-up.</DOC>

 - The interjections have started already about Work for the Dole. -  - The Labor Party hate Work for the Dole, don't they! What they hate about it is that it has been one of the most successful programs the Howard government has ever run, and that is a fair claim because there have been plenty. But can I say thank you very much to the member for Braddon for his question. He is already helping to lift participation rates in his electorate and helping forestry workers stay in their jobs. He is helping local communities to work with Work for the Dole projects. The member for Braddon was very pleased, as I was, with the result of the Work for Dole team who renovated playground equipment at the Leighland Christian School in east Ulverstone. Participants there learnt formwork, concreting and paving. I am told that the kids at the school were absolutely rapt with their renovated play gear.This program provides young people and mature age people with an excellent opportunity to increase their work experience to show employers that they are genuine about getting a job. I cannot for the life of me understand why it is that the Labor Party now are up to 330 times where one person or another on the other side has criticised the Work for the Dole program. -  - You should be serious about helping Australians into work. So why don't you get out of the way of blocking Work for the Dole and adopt it as an excellent program and follow in the footsteps of this government?</DOC>

 - As I think the honourable member will be aware, the preliminary results of the analysis of the substance indicate that, in all probability, it is not toxic. I think the basic circumstances are well known. I have been briefed on the broad substance of the note which accompanied the material. For police investigation reasons I am not at liberty to disclose what that substance is, although I would be willing to privately inform the Leader of the Opposition of what I have been told. Also, I extend to him and to the member for Barton, who has the portfolio responsibility in this area for the opposition, the facility of any briefing that they would like to have.As far as additional security measures are concerned, in the light of this incident the government is reviewing those and, if any further measures are needed, they will be implemented. Insofar as the welfare of the staff is concerned, it is my advice that none of them has reported ill at present and that, after the decontamination process last night, they were allowed to go home. Insofar as possible retaliatory action in Indonesia is concerned, there is always a danger of that. Just as we cannot guarantee that a random act of stupidity with an evil intent from amongst our 20 million people will not occur, equally I cannot expect a guarantee from the Indonesian government that some evil act of retaliation will not occur in that country. I can only repeat - and I think I speak for all Australians - that this was a reckless, evil act.Whether the substance ultimately is concluded to be harmless or not, the intimidatory effect, the damage it has done to the perceptions of this country in the eyes of people in Indonesia and the understandable fear it instilled in the staff at the embassy and all that that connotes for our relationship are to be totally deplored. I can only say again - and I echo the views that I heard the honourable gentleman himself express this morning - that those responsible for this act should be pursued and prosecuted with the full rigour of the law. It is something that is quite unacceptable in our country. Insofar as it may have been related to other matters, in that context my great concern is that it has been utterly counterproductive.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. When I heard of the incident that the Prime Minister has been talking about in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, I called the Indonesian ambassador initially but subsequently called the Indonesian foreign minister in order to convey Australia's regret for what had happened, to condemn the action and to explain that we would continue to provide all possible assistance to the Indonesian embassy and staff and that we would do all we could to bring to justice the people who have perpetrated this offence. Dr Hassan Wirajuda, who is the foreign minister of Indonesia, said he very much appreciated the call. As he was with the President at the time I spoke to him, he passed the messages that I conveyed on to the President, and I appreciate that.Our ambassador in Jakarta, Mr David Ritchie, has also conveyed these messages to senior Indonesian officials in Jakarta. We have also ensured that public statements made here in Australia by leading politicians and others have been distributed to the Indonesian media as widely as possible in order that the perspective of Australia in response to this outrage can be properly conveyed more broadly to the Indonesian people.Unfortunately, this is not the first time there has been any threat to Indonesians. There was an incident a few months ago which was quite widely reported when a bullet was sent to the consulate of Indonesia in Perth. It is important to reiterate yet again that the Australian government - and, I know, the whole of the Australian parliament - condemns these threats, which serve no practical purpose at all and, amongst other things, are damaging to international perceptions of Australia.Next week a bipartisan parliamentary delegation from Australia will be visiting Indonesia. The raison d'etre of the visit is really to go to Aceh and look at the reconstruction work there, but that delegation, which is to be led by the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, Mr Bruce Billson, will also be in Jakarta and will have an opportunity to meet with senior government ministers there and, I hope, with many members of the Indonesian parliament in order to convey some of the very same messages that both sides of the House have been giving in relation to this incident at the Indonesian embassy.Can I just say in conclusion that, as the Prime Minister has already made clear, the Federal Police have instituted a joint investigation team, including the ACT and Australian Federal Police national police component. The Indonesian police have agreed to provide some officers to assist this investigation. Three Indonesian national police members and one representative from the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture will travel to Canberra to form part of the joint investigation team.</DOC>

An opposition member - Who did? - He has not been removed from the office - it is as simple as that. In relation to the former part of the question it will be my intention to ensure that the individual who will head this - and I hope to make an announcement on that in the next few days - will have the powers that he needs to conduct an effective and thorough review.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. Obviously his question has implications in relation to the matter that we were dealing with earlier. Australia obviously deplores the serious criminal act which has caused disruption and concern for the safety of staff and members of the public at the Indonesian embassy. As the Prime Minister has already mentioned, exhaustive analysis of the exact nature of the substance requires ongoing investigations but preliminary reports are that it is unlikely to be of pathogenic significance.Regardless of the outcome of those inquiries, I want to make it clear that the action by whoever undertook this activity constitutes a criminal offence which can attract very severe penalties. In 2001 we increased the maximum penalty for a hoax mail offence under the Criminal Code from five years to 10 years. There are also serious federal offences that deal with persons who send a dangerous product through the post. If such an act resulted in harm or death to a person then a range of other offences, including possible manslaughter and even murder offences could apply. Obviously, the Australian Federal Police are investigating this very serious criminal act and I would not want to intrude in relation to that investigation.I want to thank and place on record our gratitude to the Australian Federal Police and the ACT Emergency Services Bureau Hazmat crews who were involved in this emergency response yesterday. Their prompt action in securing the site and undertaking decontamination of 44 staff members highlights the very effective coordination and cooperation that exists for handling such an emergency if it arises. It demonstrated the way in which the specialist equipment that we rolled out to all states and territories, under the $17.8 million chemical, biological and radiological enhancement program, is operating. This sophisticated equipment, which includes detection, decontamination and protection systems, complements the existing equipment managed by states and territories. The equipment was instrumental in the emergency response yesterday. It was very effectively used. It ensures that the first responders, in an event of an emergency such as this, are in the best possible position to protect us from the potentially devastating consequences of such a tragic act.</DOC>

 - As the former shadow minister, who asked a question a moment ago, would well know from his briefing yesterday, that was an internal Customs report that was put together for their own internal use and instruction. It was not intended for release. Let me make this point again because the Labor Party does not seem to want to understand the key point in this. The report at the heart of those questions was put together in 2003. That was confirmed again yesterday by the head of Customs. It does not describe the current situation at Sydney airport.Furthermore, it was put together before the latest round of 65,000 background checks was conducted on staff working in security sensitive areas of Australian airports. As I have said to this place, in those checks ASIO did not identify any individual as having a history of politically motivated violence. But in the unfortunate climate that we now have, where the opposition is more intent on playing the politics of this issue, I again refer the House to an independent person who knows more about aviation security in this country than anyone opposite. I do not think anyone would challenge that assertion. There would be no-one in this country better equipped than Neil Fergus, who was responsible for aviation security at Sydney airport during the Sydney Olympics, who was a consultant in Athens for the games last year, and who has reviewed 40 airports, internationally. He said:I am hard stretched to think of another airport internationally that is of a similar standard to Sydney or Melbourne in relation to these matters.That is the message that I think should be heard by the Australian people. There is no complacency or smugness on our part. I have made it quite plain, at all points, that we get very regular updates, very regular reports on aviation security. We benchmark as often as we can. We have the Office of Transport Security taking forward the government's policy. The government sets these policies. They are then taken forward by our agencies. We seek to learn, at every point, where changes need to be made and we make those changes as quickly and efficiently as we possibly can in the interests of the safety of the travelling public of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I can inform him that the building approvals data for April released today showed an increase in approvals for medium-density residences, that approvals for private sector houses were flat and that approvals for private sector dwellings overall have fallen over the course of the year by around 15.6 per cent. This shows that the moderation in the housing market is well under way. House prices are showing moderation, there has been a fall in new housing finance commitments and yesterday's national accounts indicate that the unsustainable price rises we have seen in the housing market over recent years are now unwinding in a mild way, which the government welcomes.Also released today were the data on international trade in goods and services for the month of April. They showed a dramatic improvement in the trading position in April compared to March. The deficit on the balance of goods and services halved from $2.6 billion to $1.3 billion in April. Exports were up 9.3 per cent and were 16.2 per cent higher than a year ago, led principally by mining exports. In addition to that, imports fell by 0.4 per cent. Obviously, there have been dramatic price increases in relation to coal and iron ore in particular. - Actually, over the March quarter, volumes have increased. - Metallurgical and coal exports have increased 17.3 per cent and the volume of iron ore exports in the year to March has increased by 16.5 per cent. So, over the year to March, the volumes have increased -  - The sound-effects man shoots his interjections about volumes. When one points out that the volumes have gone up 17.3 per cent and 16.5 per cent over the year, I think that should answer his interjections. The fact that Australia's exports are up and imports are down is good news which I believe will be welcomed by all, with the possible exception of the member for Hotham. It shows that the economy is reweighting out of the domestic sector and into the export sector. I believe that that will be consistent with continuing and more sustainable growth over the year ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for his question. I think he would make a very good shadow Treasurer. I welcome the fact that at least somebody on the Labor front bench is prepared to ask me a question. - He might have to walk over the member for Lalor to get there! -  - I did say earlier that, of the five shadow Treasurers the Labor Party has had in the position since 1996, unquestionably the worst is the member for Lilley. I indicate to the member for Hotham, who is prepared to ask questions -  - that, as I said in answer to the previous question, all members of the House, with the possible exception of the member for Hotham, will welcome the fact that there was a dramatic improvement in Australia's trade performance in the month of April - not only a halving but, in value terms, a nine per cent increase in exports and, in value terms, a fall in imports. I think all Australians of goodwill will welcome that particular outcome. As I said yesterday, this will mean an improvement in the balance of payments in the June quarter. The budget forecasts that the balance of payments will decrease to something like 5½ or 5¾ per cent over the course of 2005-06. The most important thing, of course, is that the government itself is making no call on savings.What is different between what occurs today and what occurred under the Labor Party? When we had high deficits under the Labor Party in 1995 and the early 1990s the Australian government was borrowing, the Australian government was running down savings. The difference today is that the Australian government does not run down savings; the Australian government adds to savings. Why? Because we got rid of the Leader of the Opposition as the Minister for Finance, we have balanced the budget and we have retired $90 billion of net Commonwealth debt, and Australia is much stronger for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is of no small importance to business as to what they do with their payrolls on 1 July. One side of Australian politics wants Australians to have a tax cut on 1 July and the other side of Australian politics, the Australian Labor Party, opposes tax cuts on 1 July. The instruments that can put this into effect have now been tabled in this House and the Labor Party did nothing to disallow them last Thursday and has done nothing to disallow them on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week. This is no small matter.Here is the set of schedules that employers have to put in place on 1 July if the Australian Labor Party does not disallow them. It consists of 22 separate schedules with weekly, fortnightly and monthly pay withholding amounts. It shows those amounts with and without leave loading and for those paying the Medicare levy and those not; it has special tables for employees with HECS debts under the Student Financial Supplement Scheme; it has particular tables for particular industries such as actors, variety artists and other entertainers; and it has tables for age pensioners and low-income persons. If the Australian Labor Party will give an assurance that it will not disallow this schedule in the Senate, that is what employers have to be ready to apply on 1 July.If they do not give that assurance, this second set of schedules, which has also been prepared by the Australian Taxation Office, will be the one that will apply. That too has 22 different schedules: with or without dependants; with HECS debts, without HECS debts; with Medicare, without Medicare; for senior Australians and without them. There they are.MYOB, which prepares these schedules in a software system, says that it needs to know - the cut-off date is 6 June - whether you load that one on your computer or you load that one on your computer. If the Australian Labor Party cannot decide by 6 June MYOB will load that one with a manual override and password for that one depending on what the outcome will be. And these have to be applied to each and every employee.The Leader of the Opposition was asked about this on Lateline last night. He was asked whether he had made up his mind yet whether he will be voting to disallow these schedules. Alas, notwithstanding that the budget came down on 12 May, he is yet to make up his mind. He is still determined not to be determined in relation to this matter. He had the hide to say on the Lateline program last night, 'Oh, well, we disagree with MYOB. Employers don't need from 6 June to load this into their computers and get ready.' As if the Leader of the Opposition has ever met a payroll in his life! - As if I have! When I was employing people you used to go down to the Australia Post Office and buy the tax stamps and lick them and put them on the back. And anyone who has employed anybody, including me, knows what it is like and they know that you need certainty. In relation to MYOB the Leader of the Opposition said last night, 'Oh, well, they've got plenty of time to do all of this.'  He was not always so dismissive of MYOB. When he was trying to pretend that he knew something about small business he went to the Small Business Summit in Sydney on 17 May. He tried to show that he knew something about small business. He said:This broader economic backdrop may seem obscure ... to a small business owner who is sitting down at the end of the week - this is the Leader of the Opposition - ... with the calculator and the MYOB printouts, trying to work out what's left after paying the wages ...Never was a truer word spoken but when they sit down with MYOB print-outs from now on he will have given them that set and that set. Why? Because he cannot make up his mind. He cannot make a decision. He cannot show any leadership and behind him sits a backbench who are following him down this track to this folly. I say to each and every one of them: get out of the way of small business; let people have their tax cuts; no more of these stunts; show some understanding of what small business in this country wants.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question, but I must say I thought the member for Hotham put in a better performance. The reality is that if you have a single income family with two children, one under five, you do not pay tax in net terms until you go above $40,000. - I said that, and the reason for that is -  - Oh no, it is very, very real. And the reason for that is they qualify for family tax benefit A in relation to both children and they qualify for family tax benefit B in relation to the person that is not in the work force. The consequence of that is very, very real payments - cash out their tax liability. And I have got more news. They get $600 per child per annum. And it is real money. It goes into bank accounts and it comes out again. When you go to the supermarket you can exchange it for goods and services. It exists, it is real; and, yes, the earth is round.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and I can inform him and the House that tomorrow the government will be asking the premiers of the states other than Victoria to refer their workplace relations and industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. Today we see a report in a newspaper which highlights again the inefficiency of workplace relations systems in the states which are costing new investment in Australia. Indeed, on page 1 of the West Australian newspaper today, under the heading 'IR fears see Japan pull out of power bid', it is reported:One of Japan's biggest electricity companies has pulled out of the race to build a $400 million power station in the South-West at the 11th hour, citing fears about WA's industrial relations climate.The article goes on to say that Japanese giant J-Power, which has conducted business in some 59 countries around the world, teamed up with the Australian company Wesfarmers almost three years ago to tender for the right to build the new base load power station for Western Power. In this article a spokesman for Wesfarmers says that the reasons behind the company's departure included:... perceptions of heightened industrial relations risk in WA.That led J-Power to see significantly increased project risk from their international perspective.This, in one sense, is not surprising. Since the Gallop government came to power in Western Australia in 2001 and reinstated a regressive industrial relations system -  - the rate of industrial disputation in Western Australia has almost trebled from 32 working days lost per thousand employees to 77 working days lost per thousand employees in 2004. - Indeed, during that period Western Australia has become the strike capital of this nation. As the Managing Director of Alcoa, Mr Wayne Osborn, recently said:WA has the reputation for being an increasingly difficult industrial relations and regulatory environment. This makes it a less attractive place to invest or grow business in ...Here is an example of that today, with J-Power pulling out of this investment in Western Australia. When otherwise it is a good time to invest in Australia, given the sound economic management of this nation, we have this pulling down of the industrial relations system which is turning investors off Australia. No doubt it is the reason why the Managing Director of Wesfarmers, Michael Chaney, recently said:Australia's productivity performance has slowed and remains below that of many of our key competitors, making further labour market reform a necessity if growth and rising living standards are to continue. - We have got six confusing, costly and complicated industrial relations systems operating in Australia. The time is right to have one national system. The premiers tomorrow should see the sense of that and refer their powers to the Commonwealth.</DOC>

He asked the question -  -  - You do not want to hear the answer; you just want to talk. - No reason was given for the request at the time. - I will start again. -  - You asked the question. Do you want an answer or is it just a time for interjections? My department was approached in September 2004 by the immigration department for Ms Solon's passport dossier. No reason was given for the request at the time and DIMIA did not provide the necessary privacy authorisation required by the Privacy Act, so the information was not passed on and DIMIA did not pursue the request.The member for Griffith, at a doorstop this morning, revealed that he is ambivalent about unfair dismissal laws because he opposes our changes to unfair dismissal laws. But he says that I should be taking the axe to people in my department and that heads should roll over this affair - that I should be sacking people in my department. This only reminds us of the time when the member for Griffith worked in the Queensland government and was known as Dr Death because of the number of people he used to sack.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for the question. He represents some of the seriously drought affected farmers in Australia. I expect to visit some of them tomorrow and the next day as we look at some of the issues confronting drought affected farmers in the state of Victoria. There has been a lot of attention on the drought in New South Wales, but it is important to note that it has also been severe in Victoria, Queensland and parts of South Australia and Western Australia. There are drought declared areas in all of those states. The honourable member for Mallee has been at the forefront in drawing attention to the plight of farmers, particularly in the Mallee and Wimmera regions. Many of them are in receipt of prima facie EC assistance at present while their application for a full declaration is under consideration. We are very conscious of the particular needs in that area and the special concerns that they and other grain-growing areas are facing, with the risk that the lack of winter rains may prevent the planting of the winter crop altogether this year in the eastern states. That would have enormous implications for many regional communities.The government is providing significant assistance to Australian drought stricken farmers. Nearly 34,000 applications for income support and 16,700 applications for interest subsidies have been approved. They represent 65 areas in Australia which have had EC declarations at some time since the drought reached its worst in 2002. These families receive income support, concessions, access to youth allowance, health care cards and the like. That contribution is already worth about three-quarters of a billion dollars. Assistance has been real and substantial. In parts of northern Victoria, up to three out of four farmers have qualified for assistance. Three out of four farmers have met the criteria and received assistance. There are some places, not just in Victoria but in New South Wales and Queensland, where the majority of farmers have been able to receive some assistance.I acknowledge the work of Centrelink and its staff, the Minister for Human Services for his role in ensuring that the payments are made promptly and the Centrelink drought call centre. All of these people have done a tremendous job to help farmers through these difficult times, to respond promptly to their concerns, to deal with the often complex issues associated with the declaration and to make sure that the funds flow as smoothly as possible to farmers in distress. The new package of measures will require additional effort on the part of the Centrelink people and the rural adjustment authorities. Everyone is working in a really sterling style to deliver these benefits as quickly as possible.In relation to alternative policies, unfortunately we are not receiving a lot from most of the states. In fact, most of the state budgets that have been brought down over recent times have actually got reduced allocations to their agriculture departments. It will only take about two to three weeks for the federal government to pay the farmers in drought areas in New South Wales what the state has budgeted for the entire year. I think there is room for some of the states to recognise that this drought has reached enormous proportions and they have a bigger share of the load that they should bear.</DOC>

 - I thought my department did a stalwart job in Senate estimates of explaining any contact it had in relation to this matter. All of this information has been passed to the Palmer inquiry, and the Palmer inquiry will make recommendations. Obviously, the Prime Minister and the cabinet will consider those recommendations and appropriate action will be taken. I regret to inform the honourable member that he did not listen to what I said in answer to my previous question. He asked why it was that in September 2004 my department did not act on the request in relation to the passport dossier. I explained in my answer to the previous question. The honourable member used to be the Minister for Justice, I think, so presumably he would be very, very focused on adhering to the rule of law and the law of the land. I would have thought so, as he was the justice minister. I did actually explain that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs did not provide the necessary privacy authorisation which was required by the Privacy Act. Whatever the opposition may think of DFAT - and the opposition is very happy to use its services - my department does not act in breach of Australian law. It is as simple as that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and congratulate him on his very strong support of industry in the seat of Bass, particularly the forest industry. Of course Australian industry is a key driver of jobs, exports and infrastructure investment, and this government continues to stand right behind industry as it goes forward. Through long-term industry plans, business grants, incentives and other measures we are working in partnership with industry to ensure it grows and prospers. This morning we ensured that that strong record continues with the announcement of major project facilitation status for the $1.5 billion pulp mill proposed for Bell Bay in regional Tasmania. This measure recognises the project's national significance and ensures streamlined partnerships with government to bring it to reality. The economic benefits expected to be generated are substantial. Initially some 8,000 jobs, direct and indirect, will come in the construction phase, followed by a further 1,500 direct and indirect jobs during its operational phase and some $350 million worth of export earnings for Australia, along with import replacement. All in all, the pulp mill is expected to add about two per cent to GDP growth in Tasmania.It is amazing how much is going on in Bass now that we have a member for Bass who sits on our side than when the member for Bass sat over with the opposition. Even the member for Batman is supporting this project. He has issued a press release supporting this project - a press release, unfortunately, that is not worth the paper it is written on because the member for Batman, along with all the members of the opposition, plans to abolish Invest Australia, the very agency that is working on this project to ensure it comes around. While the Labor Party would stand there and watch jobs, export opportunity and infrastructure investment go overseas, this government is getting on with the job of developing economic opportunities in Australia.</DOC>

 - I certainly do remember making that comment about the minister. It was made in the context of the referral of the 201 cases to the Palmer inquiry, and I would repeat my view that, given that there is no evidence that any of those 201 cases disclosed any administrative failure or wrongdoing, her determination to refer all of them to the inquiry demonstrated a high order of transparency. I think she is to be commended for that. As to the details you raised in relation to the inquiry from the priest and the follow-up by GSL, not surprisingly I do not receive all of her correspondence, which is very voluminous. I will make inquiries about that matter and if there is anything further that should be provided it will be.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. As the House knows - there was discussion about this last week - the Japanese have submitted plans to the scientific committee of the International Whaling Commission that would expand their whaling program in the Southern Ocean, and our government is strongly opposed to all forms of commercial and scientific whaling, particularly while whale stock numbers remain under threat. Australia's diplomatic missions around the world have been coordinating with like-minded countries - which is a lot of countries - to make known to the Japanese our concerns about their proposals. Our ambassador in Tokyo will today be leading a joint delegation of diplomats to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge Japan to cease its scientific whaling program. - The honourable member for Griffith mocks this initiative by our ambassador. He mocks our ambassador and mocks our diplomatic service. It is hardly surprising that if you ask DFAT officers what they think it would be like having him as the minister you note they think of it with trepidation. Anyway they do not need to worry for at least quite some period of time.The Australian ambassador, who is a fine Australian, will be joined by 15 others, including representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and New Zealand. Similar representations will be made next week to the Japanese fisheries agency. Senator Ian Campbell will be meeting his counterparts this week and he will be travelling to the Pacific next week to build support for Australia's position on Japan's scientific whaling. The Prime Minister has also written, as the House knows, to Prime Minister Koizumi, urging Japan to reconsider its proposal. All of the governments that are participating in this demarche, as it is called in diplomatic terms, believe that this is a sensible way to approach the Japanese government. We very much hope that the Japanese government as a whole - not just the fisheries agency but the Japanese government as a whole - will reflect very carefully on the representations that have been made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The study of the health outcomes in aircraft maintenance personnel finally reported, and in December last year the government, as the member would know, made a response to that report. The commitment from that was that there would be a lump sum benefit paid to all those who were exposed. That benefit would not distinguish between military personnel, public servants and civilians. In the interim, I understand that there has been a period of time in which affected personnel could feel frustrated. - I will get to that in a moment. Can I just say, though, that there are complex policy issues in finally determining the nature of the lump sum payment - its interrelationship with existing compensation payments, including WorkCover in Queensland, where the majority of those people are based. But it is not true to say that people have not received compensation in the interim. The reality is that any former or serving member of the Defence Force is entitled to make a claim with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In fact, the total number of claimants with the Department of Veterans' Affairs under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is 439. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act it is also 439. Of those, the liability accepted for the total number of claimants is 173. Depending on the severity of the service related illness or injury that people have had a claim accepted for, they can receive substantial lump sums, income support and of course health support. So it is not true -  - There are people now whose claims have been accepted and they are receiving compensation, income support and health support. The other point to make in relation to this is that there is an interim health scheme in place. People in group 1 - those who were inside the tanks and most severely exposed to the solvents - are already under the health interim scheme, receiving full health care for whatever illnesses they have related to reseal-deseal. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has had a repatriation system in place for 87 years. The final details of the lump sum amount will be known shortly. It has been worked out such that it does not interrelate poorly with other schemes in place. However, it is not true to say that those who have been exposed do not have full health care for any illness related to their exposure in the tanks. Nor is it true to say that people have not had claims submitted and fully accepted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and for being such a strong advocate for small business in his electorate. Australia's 1.2 million small businesses continue to benefit from the very strong economic management of this government. The budget delivered to small businesses, on top of all of the tax cuts, $30 million to the Small Business Assistance Program, which provides a range of practical assistance to small business; $36 million to Business.gov.au, which is the most up-to-date and comprehensive online range of support and assistance available to small business 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and, in addition to that, $9 million for mentoring and succession planning and funding 57 field officers who can work face to face out in areas where small business needs that assistance most.This government understands the needs of small business and we deliver on our commitments to small business, unlike those who sit opposite. For once I agree with Mr Paul Keating, who said:The Labor Party has given up the middle class, middle ground, sole employer, self-employed and small business voter _He is right: they have no commitment to small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. They are the schedules the tax commissioner has made, which, if they are allowed, will give every Australian a tax cut on 1 July. They are the schedules which will prevent them getting a tax cut if the Australian Labor Party disallows the other set and Australians will not get a tax cut on 1 July. In Senate estimates today the Commissioner of Taxation was asked a question about what would happen if the Australian Labor Party disallows the schedules. He said that, by definition, they would not get the tax cuts. They would have a choice - either waiting 12 months to lodge their tax return to get those tax cuts or there could be a variation lodged by seven million Australians individually for the schedules to catch up. People want to know whether or not they are going to get that tax cut on 1 July.Amid extraordinary scenes in Senate estimates, where Senator Conroy tried to prevent the commissioner from answering questions, the commissioner was asked what would be necessary for him to instruct employers to use the schedule that gives the tax cut. He was asked this question in relation to the schedules: 'For you to have the certainty to communicate with employers that the 2005 schedules will apply, would it be sufficient for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up in the House today and say that the opposition will not disallow the 2005 schedules? Would that be sufficient certainty for you if that were to happen today?' The commissioner said, 'If that were to occur I would feel comfortable advising employers to proceed on the basis that the 2005 schedules would apply on 1 July.' The Leader of the Opposition can get on his feet before this parliament rises and with one statement make sure that every Australian can have their tax cut on 1 July 2005, or, if he does not, deny them a tax cut on 1 July, requiring mass variations and the filing of their 2005-06 tax return before they catch up for the period that they have missed out.Why is every Australian employer and every Australian income tax payer put in this place of confusion today? Because the Australian Labor Party on budget night made the wrong call. They said they would oppose these income tax cuts. Since then, every step has been backing and filling, trying to pretend that this has nothing to do with them and somebody else can sort this problem out. I say to the Labor Party: this is a problem of your own making. There is only one thing for the Leader of the Opposition to do for Australians as this parliament gets up after the two-week session after the budget: take up the invitation of the Commissioner of Taxation, walk to that dispatch box, say he will not disallow these schedules and let every Australian have a tax cut on 1 July. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I think I can now advise the House that all Australian income taxpayers are likely to get their income tax cut on 1 July this year. The attempt by the Labor Party to block tax cuts for hardworking Australians has failed. Over the weekend we had an announcement from the Australian Greens -  - The Australian Greens were able to make up their minds. The Australian Labor Party is still determined not to determine a position. I never thought I would say this, but the Australian Labor Party makes the Australian Greens look decisive and economically responsible. The Australian Greens announced over the weekend that they will not be supporting a disallowance motion in the Senate to disallow the tax schedules. Today in the Senate Senator Len Harris said that he would not be supporting any motion of disallowance. Shortly before question time the Australian Democrats announced that they would not be voting to disallow the schedules to come into effect from 1 July 2005.Only one political party in Australia now reserves the right to disallow schedules which will give a tax cut to every Australian on 1 July 2005. The good news is that that political party is no longer relevant to the tax debate in Australia. The tax schedules can therefore take effect on 1 July 2005. For lower income earners the marginal tax rate of 17c in the dollar will be cut to 15c in the dollar. For upper income earners the threshold for the 42c and the 47c rates will be increased. And on 1 July 2006 this means that only three per cent of Australian taxpayers will be subject to the top marginal tax rate. This has been warmly welcomed by tradesmen and what are commonly called aspirational voters in Australia. As I read in the Sydney Morning Herald today, these were the aspirational voters which the Leader of the Opposition promised that he would look after when he took over from his predecessor. We were reminded in the Sydney Morning Herald by Louise Dodson that he said:Labor 'shouldn't have to be embarrassed' by the increasing wealth and prosperity of the electorate because it was due to - Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. That is what he said. Of course it is far-fetched. Labor has been defeated and all Australians will have a tax cut on 1 July.

 - The House of Representatives has already debated those amendments and rejected them. With all of the talk that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition about why he has to have a debate on these issues, I would point out to the House that the House has debated these issues and rejected them. I would warrant that the Leader of the Opposition probably even spoke in the debate; I certainly did. We all certainly voted in relation to that. - In answer to the substance of the question: as a result of the tax changes which this government has put in place, it is true that somebody on around $100,000 will receive a tax cut of about 20 per cent, and we think that is a good thing. A person on $10,000 will receive a tax cut of 50 per cent, and we think that is a good outcome too. A person on $20,000 will receive a tax cut of around 35 per cent. But, when you are cutting tax rates - I do not know whether this has occurred to the Labor Party - you cannot cut tax for people who do not pay it. I want to say that again to the Labor Party: you cannot cut tax for people who do not pay it. So, when you cut tax rates, those who are not paying any tax do not get any nominal tax cut, those who are on lower incomes get larger percentage tax cuts, and those who are on higher incomes get lower percentage tax cuts although the cuts are larger in nominal dollar terms.There is one last point I will make. In his failed attempt to stop every Australian getting a tax cut on 1 July, the Leader of the Opposition has overlooked one thing. - I just heard the member for Grayndler interject. The Labor Party policy is that on 1 July no Australians will get a tax cut. The Leader of the Opposition put forward some alternatives as to what might happen in 2006 and then claimed in his budget reply a tax cut which he would have in place under the welfare to work bonus in 2008. 2008 is after the next election. The one thing the Labor Party could agree on was that there should be no tax cut on 1 July. The one thing that Australians have been guaranteed by the coalition is that every Australian income tax payer will get a tax cut on 1 July 2005 - because Labor has failed in its attempts to stop those tax cuts going through.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and for the interest he shows in East Timor. Members of the House may be aware that yesterday the Australian peacekeepers in East Timor and Australian Ambassador Margaret Twomey handed over the former Australian battalion headquarters at Moleana base to the East Timorese government, and that ceremony was witnessed by East Timor's Prime Minister, Dr Mari Alkatiri. This event symbolised an important chapter in East Timorese history and it signalled the end of Australia's outstanding peacekeeping activities, which have been crucial to East Timor's successful achievement of independence as well as its success since independence.Our contribution to East Timor, in one way or another - really, going back to the Prime Minister's letter to President Habibie at the end of 1998 - has been an enormously important part of modern Australian foreign policy history. Our peacekeeping troops, numbering 5,000 at their peak, brought stability and security to a society that was in turmoil, and they made a real contribution to reconstruction and development. We have also generously assisted every United Nations mission to East Timor, including most recently offering some military liaison officers and civilian police advisers to the new United Nations mission there, to be known as UNOTIL. Australia's commitment has also included a very substantial aid commitment to East Timor, and I think it is fair to say that we will continue to provide that sort of assistance to East Timor for a long time to come.Yesterday was an important moment in the history of Australian foreign policy, bringing to an end our peacekeeping operation in East Timor. I think all members of the House would share with me the enormous pride we have in the wonderful job that was done by our peacekeepers in East Timor.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the foreign debt figures. I am also aware of a lot of other figures, and most particularly the figure that shows the debt servicing ratio has declined quite sharply since this government came to power. I am also aware of the figures that indicate that almost all of the overseas debt has been incurred by the private sector. I am proud of the fact that, in the time I have been Prime Minister, each year we have reduced the contribution that the government made to foreign debt. I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would ask a question about debt, because when he was finance minister he was very fond of making his own contribution to Australia's debt. It is a distinguishing feature of this government's economic management that the government has retired from the business of adding to Australia's debt. In fact, the government has entered the business of adding to the nation's savings.Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition: he does not understand much about taxation, and I do not think he understands the reality that governments can add to debt or they can add to savings. When he was a senior minister in a government he added to debt. In the time that we have been government, we have added to savings. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to take a leisurely saunter through all of the comparative economic statistics of the last eight or nine years, I will be very happy to oblige him on each and every occasion. The reality is that this government's management of the economy has won the respect of nations around the world, it has won the respect of the International Monetary Fund, it has won the respect of the OECD, but most importantly -  - and the Leader of the Opposition interjects - let me remind him it has won the respect of the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for what is a very pertinent question. It is true that in recent days there has been quite a bit of commentary, both domestically and around the world, about the relative performance of countries in relation to their labour markets in the wake of the rejection by the public in both France and the Netherlands of the European Constitution. There was some debate about the different approaches of countries in the European Union towards issues of labour market regulation and the consequences of those approaches and the levels of unemployment in those countries.It is interesting, and it is relevant in the context of the Leader of the Opposition's declaration that he would roll back our industrial relations policy. Remember what happened the last time he said he was going to roll something back? He makes a declaration that he is going to roll back our industrial relations policy. Let me say -  -  - Apparently he is not going to roll back our industrial relations policy. So he is determined not to determine that policy either. Let me say this: it repays very serious study for all members of this House to have a look at the relative performance of countries when it comes to unemployment levels and the degree to which those countries regulate or overregulate their labour markets. It is interesting to note that the rate of unemployment in Germany, France and Spain - three countries which heavily regulate their labour markets - stands at 11.8 per cent, 10.2 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.In contrast, the unemployment rate in the less regulated labour markets of the United States is 5.1 per cent - that is exactly half of ours - and of Britain is 4.7 per cent, a result, incidentally, of the reforms of the Thatcher government which Blair Labour did not roll back. Blair Labour had the commonsense to hang onto the Thatcher reforms because the Blair Labour government knew that the Thatcher reforms were needed and it would be economic suicide for the United Kingdom to roll those things back.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants some inspiration about rolling back industrial relations changes, he ought to look to the example of his Oxford mate, Mr Tony Blair, who had the commonsense to recognise that the national interest required the courageous reforms of the Thatcher era to be retained. But here we have the United States at 5.1 per cent and Britain at 4.7 per cent. In a mirror image, New Zealand, we had labour market reforms by the National Party which the incoming Labour government left virtually untouched. No roll back in Britain, no roll back in New Zealand - but, 'Oh no, don't take any notice of successful Labour leaders; I am going to roll back your industrial relations policy.'I was asked whether there were any reports, and I can inform the member for Paterson that in 2004 the World Bank published a report that investigated the scope and the manner of regulations that enhance business activity. What the World Bank research found was very interesting. It found that the more intrusive regulated approach of the recruitment and dismissal of employees - in other words, the unfair dismissal law approach pioneered by the Keating government in 1992 - had the following the circumstances: fewer jobs were created, lower average national income, a larger black economy, a greater likelihood that female unemployment would be higher, a greater likelihood that youth unemployment would be higher and a greater likelihood that unemployment amongst the unskilled would be higher.The World Bank went on to find that flexible labour markets provide job opportunities for more people, ensuring that the best worker is found for each job, and that productivity, wages and output rise. Access Economics put it this way:Far from protecting the vulnerable, rigid employment regulations exclude them from the market. 'Outsider' groups lose out from rigid employment laws. That is neither fair nor efficient.It is not fair. It is not efficient. That is why the government intend to build on our reforms of the last nine years through the workplace relations package I announced in this place several weeks ago and why we are committed to the national interest. We are determined to provide the underpinnings of further employment growth, further productivity growth and further strengthening of the Australian economy through progressive further freeing of the Australian labour market.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the member for Perth that, in making submissions to the bench of the Industrial Relations Commission on national wage cases, the government has regard, as is its obligation, to not only the interests of the employed but also the interests of the unemployed. I say to the members who sit opposite that, had they paid more regard to the interests of the unemployed when they were in office, they would not have left us with 8.5 per cent unemployment - unemployment would not have soared to almost 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. - Let me also finally remind the member for Perth of something, as I did when I introduced these reforms. The opposition asks for guarantees. The opposition seeks to compare this with that. The one comparison that the opposition will always run away from is the comparison that the Australian people remember. In 9¼ years this government has presided over an increase in real wages of 14 per cent. It will be ever to the shame of the once-styled workers party of Australia that, when they were in office for 13 long years, the increase in real wages was a meagre 1.2 per cent. - It will be forever to the shame of the Hawke-Keating governments, which claimed to represent the interests of the Australian workers, that they not only drove their wages down; they drove them and their children out of work. - Not only did they do that but they also left a disgraceful $96 billion federal government debt when this government came to office. I say to the member for Perth: ask the everyday person to compare the salary record under this government with the salary record under Labor. I could not be happier if you did so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform him and the House that Australia has been a very strong supporter for debt forgiveness through the IMF and the World Bank for heavily indebted poor countries. In fact, in 2000 the government pledged 100 per cent bilateral debt forgiveness for countries that qualified under that program. Australia has forgiven 100 per cent of the bilateral debt of Ethiopia and Nicaragua, which were the two countries, known as HIPCs, that owed money to Australia. In addition to that, the government has committed $112 million to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for debt write-offs by those multilateral institutions. That is Australia's per-shareholding obligation under those write-offs.The government welcomes the announcement of enhancing the HIPC initiative that was made at the G8 summit over the weekend. Importantly, the announcement was that qualifying countries - that is, HIPCs - would be entitled to 100 per cent debt forgiveness rather than just a write-off to a level of debt sustainability, which has been the program to date. The announcement was that the write-off would take place and the amount in payments would be netted off, by way of adjustment, new payments from the African Development Bank and the World Bank; that shareholders in those banks would then make up the write-off; and that the increased pool would be available to all IDA qualifying countries. This means that more relief will be available not just to HIPC countries but to other developing countries. This will take considerable further work to be developed before the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in September, but it is a very welcome announcement and Australia very strongly supports it. In the 2005-06 budget the Australian government increased its aid commitment by $238 million to $2.5 billion in official development assistance.I will make two points in closing. The first is that the important thing for debt forgiveness is that the savings be allocated to poverty reduction. If the savings that are captured are taken in corruption or in enriching those who are responsible for mismanagement in some of these countries then the poor will not have received a thing. That is why it is so important to have poverty reduction programs in place that can get those savings out to those who really need them.The second point I will make is that the World Bank estimated last year that trade liberalisation would deliver $350 billion in income to developing countries per annum by 2015. That benefit to developing countries would be five times the global aid flow. Let me repeat that: trade liberalisation would deliver to developing countries five times the value of aid flow by 2015. To get some perspective on that, however important aid is - and aid is very important - trade liberalisation would deliver five times the benefit to the poor of the world if the world were able to come to a trade liberalisation program. That is why this government also supports trade liberalisation. Not only is it important for economic development but it is important to help the poorest countries by giving them access to world markets.</DOC>

 - I think it was the former immigration minister, now the Attorney-General, who remarked last week that when he became immigration minister there were 300 children behind the wire. Let me simply say this to the Leader of the Opposition: I answered his first question and I refer him again to that answer in relation to the handling of any private member's bill on this subject. I have nothing to add to that answer. Can I also tell the Leader of the Opposition that the government intends to maintain to the full the framework of the current policy. I indicated to this parliament a couple of weeks ago - and I repeat it - that where opportunities present themselves to administer that policy in a more flexible way, those opportunities will be taken.The truth is that, the last time the Leader of the Opposition had anything of substance to say on this subject, he flipped and he flopped in a fashion which is well remembered. The truth is that this government has run a successful policy of ensuring that we decide the nature of immigration flows to this country. I believe that that policy is not only the right policy but a policy that enjoys the support of the Australian people. There have been a number of changes made to the administration of that policy. I have indicated, consistent with the maintenance of the framework of the policy, a willingness on the part of the government to make further changes. But those changes will not be such as to undermine or destroy the framework of a policy which I believe in, and which, incidentally, I thought the Leader of the Opposition supported. If my memory serves me correctly, at the time of the 2001 election he said there was not a cigarette paper's difference between us and that he stood shoulder to shoulder with the government. That is what he said in 2001 when he was running around the country trying to pretend that he was not Mr Flip-Flop. But now, in 2005, the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to wear - as he once pronounced he would - simplicity as a talisman. The Leader of the Opposition is now trying to persuade the Australian people that he has a markedly different policy from that of the government. Let me say this: the Australian public know where the government stands on this issue; they have not the faintest idea where the Leader of the Opposition stands.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and his interest. President Musharraf of Pakistan will be visiting Australia from 13 to 16 June. This is the first ever visit to Australia by a head of state of Pakistan. Pakistan is above all a key partner for Australia in the war against terror. I do not think Australians should underestimate the importance of Pakistan in the war against terrorism. For example, Jemaah Islamiah from our own region used Pakistan for training until it was disrupted by Pakistani agencies. The Pakistanis have captured many al-Qaeda members, including most recently Abu Faraj al-Libbi. President Musharraf has been personally targeted by terrorists on a number of occasions.Quite apart from anything else, this is an opportunity for us to commend President Musharraf on the job he is doing in countering terrorism. During the visit, I will be signing with the Pakistani minister accompanying the President a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism, something that was discussed during the recent visit of Foreign Minister Kasuri of Pakistan in May. That memorandum of understanding will lead to further cooperation in areas like law enforcement, information exchanges, and exchanges on financial operations, border control, transport security and so on. For the record, that will bring to 11 the number of memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism that we have with countries around the region.Ministers will also be signing a memorandum of understanding on agricultural cooperation. Pakistan is an important market for Australian agricultural products, including wheat. We had some difficulty last year with our wheat exports, but those difficulties have been resolved. We also have an aid program with Pakistan. We are going to provide $6.6 million for a series of agricultural sector linkages, including seven scholarships to come to Australia.Let me say in conclusion that I have just been in India during the last week where I met with the Indian Prime Minister and other ministers. I made the point to the Indian Prime Minister and to the foreign minister that we very much appreciate the role that India has played with Pakistan to bring about a greater degree of accommodation between those two countries. More than that, this will be an opportunity during President Musharraf's visit to also say to President Musharraf that we appreciate the role he is playing in normalising relations between Pakistan and India.</DOC>

 - I have seen a certain amount of debate about this in the media while I have been away, so let me just make this point: there were a number of contacts with DFAT officials initiated by the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney and the Chinese embassy in Canberra about Mr Chen. Some of this contact occurred before Friday, 3 June. That was the day Mr Chen applied for a protection visa and then made public statements about his situation, and honourable members will recall that. At no time did I or any DFAT official improperly convey information about Mr Chen's intentions - of course we did not. Nor did DFAT officials, or I for that matter, convey any information about Mr Chen's bid for asylum. At the end of a formal meeting with Mr Wang, who is the head of the Chinese Communist Party's international division, on Thursday, 2 June, the Chinese ambassador briefly raised this issue with me, and she has made subsequent public comments about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Many parts, but not all, of eastern Australia that have been ravaged by drought have received good rain over the last couple of days. We hope and pray that that continues. The member asks about Australia's trade relationship with Iraq, wheat exports and food security. For 50 years the Iraqi people have relied on high-quality wheat from Australian wheat growers to supply their market in a timely and sustainable way. In fact, since 1992 we have exported 12½ million tonnes of wheat to Iraq. The new Iraq - the Iraq that we in Australia and our defence forces helped to liberate - has bought over two million tonnes of wheat from Australia since mid-2003.Given this strong relationship, we were shocked in recent weeks to hear claims of contamination of our most recent shipments. The exporter, AWB Ltd, undertook a series of independent tests of the shipments of wheat that were claimed to have been contaminated, all of which proved to clear the quality and the standard of the wheat. Following representations by our ambassador in Baghdad, Ambassador Howard Brown, senior AWB officials and me, the new democratically elected Iraqi government led by Prime Minister al-Jafari has accepted those test results and cleared the wheat for unloading. Last night the ships in Um Qasar started unloading their cargo of wheat. We very much appreciate the way that the new, democratically elected Iraqi government took a quick and clear decision once they came to office to resolve this impasse.We have extended an invitation to the trade minister,Basit Karim, to visit Australia as a guest of the government to help enhance the trade relationship between Australia and Iraq and to work on establishing protocols so this type of delay in getting shipments of wheat into Iraq and unloaded does not occur again. This happens on top of our in-principle commitment of $20 million for milling and processing facilities in Iraq and also the $125 million already committed for reconstruction purposes in Iraq as part of our aid program. Our government is determined to continue to do all it can to ensure that Australian wheat growers remain the dominant suppliers of high-quality wheat into the Iraqi market.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I think I made it pretty clear what conversations there were between the officials of my department, the Chinese embassy and the Chinese Consulate-General. They were conversations that were initiated by the Chinese, and we responded to those queries. I also explained that, at the end of a meeting on another matter that the Chinese ambassador attended, she raised the Chen case with me as she was walking towards the door and, in response to that -  - I was just explaining that, as the Chinese ambassador left my office, she raised the Chen case, so we had a brief discussion about that. There is now an application for a protection visa that was put forward, I think, on 3 June and, obviously, in those circumstances we want to be careful what we say about this case. That application will be considered according to due process and all the issues that are taken into account will be taken into account. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am aware of some proposed changes that have been reported. For example, on the weekend, the Queensland ALP conference decided that it would increase unions' voting power in ALP preselections from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, going in exactly the opposite direction to the reforms which the member for Hotham and Bob Hawke and Neville Wran attempted to put in place. No doubt this has something to do with the $9.7 million which the unions have donated to the ALP in Queensland since 1996.We can see some further examples of this influence in New South Wales. In the Sydney Morning Herald on the weekend, it was reported that in New South Wales unions which are affiliated with the ALP have 393,000 members. The Secretary of Unions NSW, Mr John Robertson, said at the weekend that only 49 per cent of them voted Labor at the last election. In terms of membership, according to the article in the Sydney Morning Herald, only one per cent of the 393,000 members of unions in New South Wales are ALP members. This stands in stark contrast to -  - I was asked about registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act, which is quite clearly in my portfolio. The reason the member does not want to hear the answer is that there is a stark contrast between less than one per cent of unionists in New South Wales belonging to the ALP and almost 100 per cent of the union bosses belonging to the ALP. It is no wonder, therefore, that on the weekend the Leader of the Opposition caved in to union demands with his roll-back of industrial relations policy. When the Leader of the Opposition addressed the two state ALP conferences on the weekend, he was not addressing the workers, most of whom do not belong to the unions and most of whom have benefited by a 14 per cent increase in real wages under this government, nor was he addressing the unionists, 99 per cent of whom do not belong to the ALP. He was simply addressing the unrepresentative union leaders, the unrepresentative union bosses. It is no wonder that in an editorial in the Canberra Times yesterday, headed 'Corruption the big ALP task', the editorial writer said this about the leader of the opposition -  - As the editorial in the Canberra Times said yesterday in part about the Leader of the Opposition:There is no better demonstration that he lacks the moral and physical fibre -  - To continue the quote:There is no better demonstration that he - the Leader of the Opposition - lacks the moral and physical fibre to be worthy of being prime minister of Australia than his refusal to face the crooked farce that is his own party. - No, Mr Speaker. Can I just conclude on this note -  - I am quoting from yesterday's Canberra Times. Indeed, for the benefit of the House, I will table the article. Can I conclude by saying this: what the Leader of the Opposition ought to be engaged in is formulating real policy instead of this roly-poly roll-back.It is not in order to use offensive words, and so on, against another Member by means of a quotation or by putting words in someone else's mouth.That is what the minister has just done. I have asked for a withdrawal. A withdrawal ought to be asked for now. The minister ought to withdraw those expressions. The fact that they were contained in a quote does not assist the minister on that basis. They ought to be withdrawn. - Mr Speaker, I just seek your clarification. The member opposite raised a point of order about an excerpt from the Canberra Times. Is that what I am asked to withdraw? - The article speaks for itself. I will otherwise withdraw. - Mr Speaker, can I also seek a clarification -  - Mr Speaker, I withdraw. On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I have tabled the document. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. As the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers agreed recently, we have a very good health system. Our challenge is to make a good system even better. That means, amongst other things, better management of chronic disease, particularly with an older population in the years to come. To that end, on 1 July, the government will introduce new Medicare items to ensure that people with chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, mental illness, heart failure, cancer and arthritis get more attention from their GPs. There will be very substantial new rebates, up to $120 per consultation, to ensure that GPs give their patients the time that they need and also to ensure that GPs become patient-managers rather than simply gatekeepers to the health system.These new items are in part a response to the red-tape task force which the government commissioned. They have been worked through with all of the GP representative groups. What they should mean is that GPs have far more time to spend with their patients, rather than on their paperwork. This is more good news from the Howard government. These are further, incremental improvements to what is already a very good system, and this is more evidence that the Howard government -  -  - They know what is coming; you know the message is getting through when the opposition parrots the message on cue. This is more evidence that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I should say at the outset that the application for a protection visa by the person involved is being processed in the normal way but as a priority. Mr Chen was provided with a briefing on his visa options before he lodged a protection visa with the department on 3 June. He was contacted by DIMIA early in the following week and offered the opportunity for a protection visa interview to be held later that week. At his request, the interview was rescheduled for a later date acceptable to him as he and his representative wanted more time to prepare the application. Questions about his request for political asylum should obviously be directed to the foreign minister's portfolio. The application will be processed in the normal way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The government has been seeking ways to improve the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians and has been particularly disappointed that, in a number of areas of Australia, organisations that have been providing those services have not been doing so in a cost-effective way. Notwithstanding that, a number of others were. In order to deal with that issue, the government has implemented a new open and competitive tendering process to ensure that Indigenous Australians have access to high-quality legal services and to ensure value for money. As the member for Herbert would be aware, on Friday I announced that two organisations had successfully tendered to deliver these services in Queensland. One of them is based in Townsville and will be delivering services to North Queensland; the other is based in Brisbane.This means that the tender process has now been completed in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. In each of these states, groups successful in winning contracts have been outstanding organisations with a proven track record in delivering comprehensive legal and support services. It also happens that they are Indigenous organisations. They have clearly demonstrated that they can, in a competitive tender situation, compete successfully. I congratulate them on the important work that they are going to undertake. I congratulate those organisations in Queensland because they had demonstrated records. This means that some of those organisations which were more questionable in the past will no longer be in the field.The tender process continues in other states, and I expect all contracts to be dealt with by 1 July next year. This is about ensuring that Indigenous people, who deserve the best possible advice and representation available, will continue to receive it - and they will get better services because they will be provided in a more cost-effective way.</DOC>

Where is the mystery on this, given that the department recently issued a media release setting out the context of the contact by the DIMIA official with the Chinese consulate? That press release made it clear that the contact -  - DIMIA has issued a statement making it clear that the contact with the PRC consulate was short; only confirmed that the person in question, Mr Chen, worked at the consulate; and did not disclose any information about Mr Chen's whereabouts or intentions. The fact that he was seeking protection was not known to the department at the time.</DOC>

This government is very proud of its record in putting people into work and helping people through employment programs. It is part of the reason that unemployment under this government has halved from what it was when the Leader of the Opposition was employment services minister. It is no wonder that we have also continued to increase participation rates in this country. We now have working age participation at the record level of 64.6 per cent and female participation at a record high of 57.1 per cent.Tonight I will hand out awards at the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards. The awards are recognition for excellence amongst the community work coordinators, the sponsors and those participants who have engaged in wonderful projects to help their communities. Over the last 12 months this government has been involved in placing 272,000 long-term unemployed people into work. There is more that we need to do, and this government will continue to do it and we will continue to support the unemployed in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. This country makes a very significant contribution to the task of dealing with international terrorism. I think we can be proud of the contribution Australia has made in the region and beyond. One component is that we have signed a series of memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism. We now have signed 11 of those memoranda. Today, it was with great pleasure that I signed, in the presence of our own Prime Minister and President Musharraf of Pakistan, the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Pakistan.These MOUs provide an excellent framework for collaboration with other countries - in particular, our regional partners such as Indonesia, Malaysia and, importantly, India - in areas such as law enforcement, with collaboration between our police forces, exchanges of intelligence and of course information, and in some cases capacity assistance in defence and border control. These MOUs are making a real contribution to our own security and to the security of our region and the broader international community.We had today a very good discussion with the President of Pakistan about the war against terrorism. I think it is worth saying yet again, as I said yesterday, that Pakistan's President and his government have made good progress in dealing with terrorism at a number of different levels. All of us have reflected on the fact that, although the war against terrorism has a long way to go and although there will be setbacks in the future - and it is important to make that qualification - and although we should not be complacent, nevertheless a good deal of progress has been made in breaking up the al-Qaeda network and its effectiveness and also, closer to home, in dealing with Jemaah Islamiah and other like organisations. Australia has played a very significant part in this war against terrorism in our region and even beyond our region. The signing today of the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Pakistan is an illustration of our absolute determination to make sure that terrorism is defeated.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I can outline to the people of Ryan that information about consumer sentiment as measured by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute was released today. Although it showed that consumer sentiment had fallen by a slight amount, 0.5 per cent, this was following a 9.5 per cent surge in May in response to the budget. Consumer sentiment is still up by nine per cent on where it was at budget time. Sentiment concerning the current state of family finances in the 12-month outlook rose. No doubt that reflects the anticipation of tax cuts which will be implemented in Australia on 1 July.The economy has moderated somewhat since last year. Rather than looking at an economy with four per cent growth, as we got used to, it is more likely that we will look at an Australian economy going down to be in the three per cent band. As I have said on numbers of occasions, this is not unwelcome. We have been looking for a moderation in the housing cycle for some time. It also looks as if we are now seeing a moderation in relation to consumption.The Reserve Bank governor, in a speech yesterday, said that he viewed the recent moderation in growth as more likely to prolong the economic expansion than to end it. That is certainly my sentiment. If consumption moderates and the housing cycle moderates, and we get some more sustainable growth in relation to those things, the duration of this current economic expansion should be prolonged.Notwithstanding that, labour market conditions are the best they have been for 29 years, with unemployment at 5.1 per cent. Our participation rate is at an all-time high. And over the last year 330,000 jobs were created in the Australian economy, with almost 70 per cent of them being full-time.This does not mean that the government should rest in relation to economic reform. It means that the government should continue and should engage in new areas of economic reform. Let me name labour market reform as the most important micro reform for the Australian economy. If we can put in place real, vibrant labour market reform, this will set Australia up in structural terms for a much more prosperous future, for more jobs and higher wages.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his great interest and indeed his past experience as a very effective state minister for water in New South Wales. I am aware that on the front page of the Australian today the attention of the nation has been drawn to the Barton Group's work. I take that as another welcome indication of the nation's very real interest in how we can better manage our national water resources. The report makes it clear that nationally Australia is now on the right track - as a result, I think I can reasonably say, of the government's key water policies, particularly the National Water Initiative, with the backup mechanisms of the National Water Commission and the Living Murray initiative. These are world-class policy prescriptions. I am thankful that, although it took a long time, most of the states and territories have risen above political point scoring and joined up. We await Western Australia joining with us.We in this country are now on track in developing nationally compatible access entitlements and nationally functioning water markets and trading. As the OECD has recently acknowledged, in many ways we are showing world leadership in this area of the integrated management of environmental water. We are also now moving in areas of measurement, monitoring and the collection and retaining of information, because they have been surprisingly lacking. We still need a lot of technological development to enable us to accurately measure water usage, particularly in our rivers and ground water systems. A great deal is happening in urban water reform, although some of the states are going to have to lift their game and do a lot more. And we are seeing serious investment in infrastructure through the $2 billion Australian Water Fund.We are seeking a judicious mix of measures for water savings, greater efficiencies and more water infrastructure so that we can do a better job with our water nationally. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced a batch of programs out of the Water Smart Australia program for water efficiency and saving projects in Queensland. Last week, he announced a $55 million contribution - a dollar-for-dollar match with an equivalent contribution from New South Wales - for structural adjustment for six overallocated ground water systems in New South Wales. We have now allocated nearly $90 million to support investments of some $250 million. There is a great driver or multiplier here in Queensland and New South Wales, and there will be more coming shortly.So, just six months on after the National Water Commission was set up, it is already getting down to the serious business of leadership and implementation of the nation's water plans. I think all Australians welcome that. I am glad to be able to again respond to community concerns about water and the need for us to do more.I do want to make this comment: it is sobering that over the last couple of decades expenditure on water infrastructure in Australia - and I do not want to be overly political, but that has been a state responsibility - has fallen way off the pace. In terms of what the OECD averages are, we are way off the mark. We have taken a very strong Commonwealth lead here. So far the $90 million we have invested has generated a further $250 million from the states, the territories and the private sector. We will need a lot more of that and less of what the report infers, and which is reported in the media as state governments having plundered the profits of water utilities and having failed to reinvest in the sector. So we look forward to better outcomes from the states and the territories. We assume they will continue to lift themselves above politics in this area.I conclude by making this point: the report makes it clear that Australia does not have a shortage of water but, rather, an underinvestment in water systems to meet the needs of future generations and that our systems for sharing and managing the resource have not been strengthened sufficiently in recent decades. We have a way forward. The National Water Initiative is providing that. That is good news. I know it enjoys the very strong support of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - The answer, essentially, is no to each of the parts of the member for Jagajaga's question. But I can say that today the people of the 24 regions, who are very enthusiastic about the Australian technical colleges proposal -  - They do want more, Prime Minister. We will have to deliver on what we promised and we can work from there. I am happy to say publicly that I will be putting a bit of pressure on to try and produce a bit more. But at the end of it they are wondering what the Labor Party are up to, because the biggest backflip this side of the last election has occurred in the last 24 hours in this place. We have got the Labor Party in the Senate actually going against Kim Beazley's, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Brand, own apparent support for the Australian technical colleges. He said on 10 March in this place, when talking about the pending legislation that the member for Jagajaga has asked about:We on this side of the House say, 'If you really want to do that - that is, the legislation - go ahead and do it. That's fine. We'll put the legislation through in the Senate. We are not worried about that. If you want to ... go ahead and do it.'But instead the member for Brand has allowed his opposition senators to delay the bill by sending it off to a Senate committee. In fact they are delaying this legislation that the member for Jagajaga is asking about for the reason of allowing those who have opposition to the bill to actually express it, denying the fact that we have been around to all 24 regions, we have spoken to local industry, we have spoken to local business, we have spoken to local education and training providers, and we have spoken to local communities, including local governments - everybody has had a view on this. The Labor Party are for it one minute and then, on the other side of the street, they are against it. Which side of the street are they on right now?</DOC>

I can inform the House that 850,000 Australian businesses now have certainty about the tax schedules to apply on 1 July and that every Australian income taxpayer will receive a tax cut on 1 July this year. The Labor Party campaign to defeat tax cuts on 1 July has been defeated. It has been defeated because the Australian Greens announced that they would not disallow the schedule, One Nation announced that it would not disallow the schedule, Senator Shayne Murphy announced that he would not disallow the schedule, the Australian Democrats announced that they would not disallow the schedule and there is only one party that has determined not to determine a position. It is the irrelevant party, the Australian Labor Party.What was standing in the way of certainty for 850,000 Australian businesses? It was the Leader of the Opposition. I was interested to read in the Canberra Times - now suitable for quotation in this House - one disgruntled Labor backbencher quoted as saying:We've been left like a shag on a rock now ... the other parties have decided to pass it.There has been some debate going on as to who is responsible for this brilliant strategy. I do not think it is fair that the Leader of the Opposition take full responsibility. I have noticed in the Australian that the cartoonist is now drawing the Leader of the Opposition as Humpty Dumpty - Humpty Dumpty who sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. I will remind the House that in that budget lockup was the member for Lilley, his offsider the member for Perth, and Senator Conroy - all of the roosters were in that lockup. As Labor searches for who is responsible for this strategy, it raises the great conundrum of Australian politics: which came first, the rooster or the egg? That is the great conundrum of Labor Party politics. - In the modern barnyard which represents the parliamentary Labor Party, what came first: the rooster or the egg? I read in the Australian that senior MPs have been critical of Mr Swan, the member for Lilley. One Labor frontbencher told the Australian, 'If there's a reshuffle, Swan has to be the first victim.' - That quote - if there is a reshuffle, Swan has to be first victim - was not delivered in Chinese, I want to say in defence of a certain member on the Labor front bench. Anyway, I would point out to the House that this side, the Liberal and National parties, has a majority in the House. Whilst ever the Liberal and National parties have a majority in the House, the member for Lilley will have the confidence of this House to remain as shadow Treasurer - and long may he reign.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I know of her interest, as chair of that committee, in the progress that is being made in this matter. I also know that members opposite from time to time have been interested in the progress that is being made. I certainly thank the honourable member, because I know she has welcomed the innovative family law reform package announced in the recent budget.I was waiting to hear from the opposition in relation to that matter. I checked very carefully whether or not there had been any observations and I had to go a long way back to find any. It was in November 2004 that I saw a statement from the opposition, which said that the government failed families. It made these points. The first point was that we had failed to provide any funding for proposed new family relationship centres. The second point was that we had failed to provide money for expanding children's contact programs. The third point was that we had done nothing to expedite hearings in the Family Court. The fourth point was that we had provided no money for ongoing relationship counselling or post-decision counselling. A further point was made that there had been no extra funds to fund legal aid or community legal centres for grandparents who were routinely denied support in courts.For that reason, I had hoped there would be some supporting comments after the budget. I went through each of the items raised and, if you look at the response we gave, we have delivered on each of them. First, we provided $200 million over three years for 65 new family relationship centres, which are the cornerstone of the package. We have delivered 30 new children's contact services across Australia. We are introducing a new single combined registry for providing families with simpler and quicker access to justice. We have delivered more than 100 new early intervention services to help families stay together. We have delivered $1.6 million for grandparents to participate in legal aid family conferences.So, far from having failed Australian families in relation to the implementation of the committee report, we have responded very fulsomely. Far from failing families in need, we have delivered in full. This is in contrast to the opposition, which clearly has no policy, no ideas and nothing to say about helping families.</DOC>

I think it was on 3 June, by the way, that the formal application was lodged for a protection visa. Not surprisingly, I am not going into the details of that conversation, except to make one point - that is, everything said by me in that conversation was perfectly proper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I noted comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, to a presentation of the Institute of Company Directors yesterday, in which he said:... industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth.These seemed like clear and unambiguous comments by Mr Macfarlane. However, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to downplay them on AM this morning, arguing:... we don't know what questions the Reserve Bank governor was asked, and we don't know the context in which he gave his answers. That's been beaten up in one newspaper today.For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I repeat the question - and the answer which Mr Macfarlane gave. He was asked:I wonder if you might comment on the quantitative effects on growth of industrial relations reform. If the Government is successful in its industrial reform agenda, would that have an impact on growth of a quarter per cent per annum or half a per cent or whatever?Mr Macfarlane answered:I think industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth, and the reform that's been undertaken to date, although it's disappointed a lot of people, has I think had quite a profound effect. It's meant that the economy can run faster without generating inflationary influences to the extent that used to be the case. So I think there's undoubtedly value in industrial relations reform.That is a clear and unambiguous statement by Mr Macfarlane.I was asked about alternative views. There is an alternative view from the Leader of the Opposition. On AM this morning we heard the following from the Leader of the Opposition:We reformed the industrial relations system._            _            _... as far as we're concerned, the reforms that needed to be there in industrial relations, the enterprise reforms and the flexibility that came with all of that, that's been done.In other words, the Leader of the Opposition says the lemon has been squeezed dry. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks about industrial relations reform, he has a lot to say about the past but he is very coy about what he will do in the future and about what his policy would mean. The Australian had a word for this policy yesterday. The Australian used the dreaded R-word, the word that the Leader of the Opposition will not use. In fact, a spokesman for the opposition after the caucus meeting was reported in the Australian as saying that it was not the R-word because: ... he would never use that expression because our pitch is about moving forward. 
The R-word, roll-back, is the Labor love that dare not speak its name. If it is not the R-word, then what is it? Is it a rollover? Is it a backflip? Is it a wind back? The reality is that once again the Leader of the Opposition is backtracking from the roll-back.</DOC>

 - On this side of politics there is no stronger supporter of our approach to industrial relations. It has increased the number of jobs available right across the economy, including in regional Australia. It has improved living standards, it has increased take-home pay and it has increased flexibility. One of the greatest threats to it - and I can tell you this, whilst I fully support -  - I fully support the responsibility of employers to ensure their workplaces are safe, but I will tell you this: the industrial manslaughter legislation proposed in New South Wales was so anti-job and so bad that your own people made you withdraw it.Leave not granted. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. As members of the House may know, the member for Bowman was an observer of the Bougainville elections recently. I thank him, by the way, for sending in a report that he produced. It is a report that demonstrates how successful these elections have been. Today is a historic day, not just for Papua New Guinea and Bougainville but for Australia. Today is the day of the inauguration of the autonomous Bougainville government. The Australian government, and I am sure the Australian people, warmly welcome this. Let me congratulate the new president of that government, Joseph Kabui, and the other 39 elected representatives. Joseph is a good friend of many of us. I think a lot of members of the House would know Joseph Kabui quite well. The Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Michael Potts, is representing us today at this historic event.The election of the autonomous government in Bougainville very much brings to an end the Bougainville conflict. I remember, and I know that the Prime Minister would remember only too well, the events of early 1997, with the Sandline crisis and the very robust response by the Australian government to an attempt by the then Papua New Guinea government to bring in mercenaries to try and solve the Bougainville conflict. I think our robust response was really the beginning of a process that the Papua New Guinea government pursued to achieve peace in Bougainville. We contributed in many ways to the peace monitoring groups. We provided substantial financial assistance. Something like 3,800 Australian Defence Force and civilian personnel have been involved with those peace monitoring groups. We have also had aid programs on the ground that have helped to deliver what I have often said when I have been in Bougainville is important: a peace dividend to the people of Bougainville.Let me say in conclusion that there is some debate about the number of people who died either directly or indirectly as a result of the Bougainville conflict, but estimates range from about 10,000 to 18,000. I make the point that three or four times as many people died in the Bougainville conflict as have died, I believe, in the Northern Ireland troubles and conflict since 1969. It is worth remembering that. This has been a very bloody and a very nasty affair.The previous National Party government of New Zealand, the present government of New Zealand and the Australian government all deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making this peace process possible. The Prime Minister and I have both been so involved in this. To know today that that government is being sworn in in Bougainville is tremendous. It is a great moment for Papua New Guinea and a great moment for Bougainville, but it is also a great moment for Australia.</DOC>

 - I cannot recall the precise details of the matter that the member for Oxley raises. I will have them checked out and report back. But this is another attack by the Labor Party on regional programs. That is what it is. These are the same programs that they say they are going to withdraw lock, stock and barrel - that is, of course, except for the five in the member for Brand's electorate. It is interesting to note that we have been having a bit of a look to see how many Labor Party members actually support regional program funding in their own electorates. We have found quite a few, but the one that particularly interested me today relates to the shadow minister Mr Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills. He has been writing letters in support of applications as well, despite his absolutely hypocritical public stance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know how important this subject is to her. As the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers recently unanimously agreed, Australia has a very good health system. It is not perfect, but it is a very good health system by international standards. Our challenge is to make a good system even better. One area where there certainly is room for improvement is organ donation. Australia has the world's best organ transplantation success rate but, along with New Zealand, the world's worst organ donation rate. Last year, thanks largely to the work of the Hookes Foundation, half a million more people joined the organ donor register and the organ donation rate actually increased by 20 per cent. But there are still nearly 2,000 people on waiting lists, and every year more than 100 people die waiting for an organ transplant.In conjunction with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the government has recently commenced a nationwide mail-out inviting people to register as donors. I am pleased to say that already some 250,000 people have responded to that mail-out, but through you, Mr Speaker, I appeal to our fellow Australians: don't ignore this appeal; don't waste your chance to help save a life. This is important: you can't - or you shouldn't - take them with you, and this is a chance to leave something worthwhile behind. These are the sorts of incremental improvements that the Howard government is putting in place to make a good health system even better.</DOC>

 - What I can confirm is that no Commonwealth moneys were used for the purchase of gaming machines. That was specifically provided for in the terms of the grant. If it is legal for them to develop a tourism facility, over and beyond that I do not quite see what the point is. I have to say that the Labor Party's hypocrisy on this issue knows no bounds whatsoever. I again refer to the comments I made just a moment ago that the member for Wills has paraded around this country, pretending -  - I again want to make the point that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this knows no bounds. The member for Wills is out there almost on a daily basis, saying that none of these programs should ever go ahead, that the whole program ought to be stopped lock, stock, and barrel. The member for Brand of course -  - I make the point that in reality the member for Wills is a supporter of this program when it suits him. That is the reality. If there is any further information to be provided to the House in relation to the Atherton Hotel, I will provide it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The seat of Barker, being a rural seat, has of course benefited from the outcomes of our negotiations of a free trade agreement with the United States. The government prosecuted the case in advance of, during and certainly after the conclusion of negotiations that this agreement would unambiguously benefit the Australian economy, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The Australian Labor Party opposed us when we brought legislation before the parliament. They continued to raise negativities about the benefits for rural and regional Australia but the benefits continued to be delivered day in and day out.We have seen the benefits for the beef and dairy industries and today we heard about benefits for the citrus industry. In the member for Barker's electorate in the Riverland, through the export company Riversun of Renmark, Australian citrus growers have seven ships booked over the next 12 weeks to deliver 1.6 million navel oranges and 500,000 cases of mandarins to the United States. The important point on this is that, yes, our citrus trade has existed in recent years with the US but as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States, the duty on citrus has been dramatically reduced. Before the free trade agreement, the duty was $US21 a pallet. These shipments will be going to the US paying only 30c a pallet duty - that is the reduction. It has made our product much more competitive and desirable in the US market. The savings are worth over half a million US dollars to this particular exporter into the US market.That is not all. We know that the Australian exports of lamb to the US faced some considerable challenges with safeguard measures that the Clinton administration put on our lamb exports to the United States. Prior to the free trade agreement, our maximum amount of tonnage exported to the US was 31,000 tonnes. According to Steve Martin from the Australian Meat Industry Council, this year we are likely to exceed 40,000 tonnes of lamb meat into the United States, which is an extra $65 million to Australia's lamb producers in a year when we are suffering from severe drought. It is a very welcome extra income for Australia's lamb producers.Contrary to a lot of the comments made by the Labor Party about the US free trade agreement over the course of this debate that there were no benefits for rural and regional Australia, the facts indicate that there are. Many industries across rural and regional Australia and the people who work within those industries are very appreciative that this government had the backbone to take on the challenge of negotiating this agreement for their benefit and for the benefit of future generations of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This area of Queensland has been very hard hit by a number of very difficult adjustment issues, including the virtual closing down of the Australian tobacco growing industry. In the face of very real social and economic pressures we have attempted to help the area restructure to develop new industries. An integral part of that has been to try to provide it with the infrastructure that would underpin a viable tourism industry with the jobs that a tourism industry would provide. The guidelines and the framework provided for this particular business enterprise have not, I am advised, been contravened. I just repeat that our objective has been to try to enhance business opportunities in a quite severely affected and depressed area of Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question - and isn't it great to have a Liberal representing Elizabeth in South Australia? It is great news for the people of Elizabeth and South Australia. This government is determined to improve service delivery to all Australians. Australian families are generally fed up with having to fill in government forms, particularly when they claim Medicare, and also going into Centrelink offices in order to claim the benefits that they are entitled to. The financial services industry moved away from banking passbooks and limited trading hours in the 1980s, but the government still pursues a process of asking people to fill out forms and go into offices.I can advise the House that the government is now developing a detailed proposal for the introduction of a national smartcard and that technology is going to provide easy access to welfare as well as health services. Current legislation ensures vigorous privacy and security standards are part of a citizen's private information protection. The microchip in a smartcard will add additional security to the protection of individuals' information. We are going to work closely with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that any improvement in service delivery using new technology will safeguard every Australian's legitimate right to privacy.We are developing this proposal as a whole-of-government proposal. I can advise the House that the Prime Minister raised this with the premiers at COAG two weeks ago and the premiers are right on board and have embraced the Australian government's approach to have a single standard and single protocol for the development of smartcard technology in Australia. I know that the Queensland government is developing a $300 million smartcard for public transport in Queensland. However, there is a danger to all of us that we are going to end up with different 'rail gauge' technology across Australia during the introduction of the smartcard. We are going to avert that, because we are going to deliver, in partnership with the states and in partnership with the private sector, common standards and common protocols that ensure that Australians are going to receive the sorts of services that they should get in the 21st century with 21st century technology.</DOC>

 - Yesterday Mr Justice Wilcox made orders following on from his judgment of the previous week or so in relation to an appeal by Australian Pork Ltd concerning the import risk protocol for importing pig meat into Australia. In that particular judgment he made a number of statements and rulings which the government consider to be of considerable significance. We have indicated our intention to appeal that judgment. Yesterday the orders required the revocation of a permit issued to one particular company. That action will naturally be taken in accordance with the judge's requirements.Mr Justice Wilcox made no ruling in relation to the other 84 permits which are in place, and the legal advice that the government have received is that those permits can continue to operate and remain in force until they expire. Some of those permits are for around two years, but some of that time will have been used up. So there will be a capacity, on the basis of the legal advice provided to the government, for imports to continue on the basis of the other 84 permits until they expire. When they expire, on Mr Justice Wilcox's ruling, they could not be renewed.However, in making those comments, let me add that the government will be pursuing an appeal in relation to the basic nature of Mr Justice Wilcox's decision, because of the significant implications of the decision for the administration of quarantine policy in Australia and other areas of administrative law.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I have seen comments made by the Reserve Bank governor on Tuesday setting forth his assessment of recent economic developments where he stated that the situation has evolved quite favourably, with domestic demand continuing to slow to a sustainable pace. The governor also said in his speech that there are indications that inflationary pressures are not building as quickly as might have been expected earlier in the year, which is good news. I remind the House that, whilst under the previous government inflation averaged 5.2 per cent per annum, under this government it has only averaged 2.4 per cent.Am I aware of some published views endorsing the government's approach to fiscal and monetary policy? Yes, I am. I have come into possession of a new book called Postcode: The Splintering of a Nation by Wayne Swan. It is not the first book that has been published under the title Postcode. Australia Post has a publication called Postcode, listing suburbs and postcodes. Of the two, I would have to say that Australia Post's is the more interesting publication. In the other Postcode, which makes Civilising Global Capital read like a saucy novel, the author of that learned tome says there are five things that can be done to keep inflation down and interest rates low.The first thing is that the government should ensure that the budget remains in balance over the cycle. Of course, that is a policy which we announced in 1996 and have had in place ever since. The second thing he says is that the government should have effective monetary policy through an independent reserve bank. Again, that is what we put in place in 1996 with my agreement of 14 August, which has been in place ever since. The third thing is that a government should finance spending through savings and reprioritisation - that means, of course, no new debt, which is the policy that our government put in place in 1996. We have now reduced Labor's debt by $80 billion, and by the end of the forthcoming financial year we will have reduced it by $90 billion.He then says that it is important to combat price inflation through pro-competitive reforms. I must say that I did gulp when he said that he was in favour of pro-competitive reforms. The Labor Party went to the last election with a policy of increasing tariffs. They have a policy of opposing industrial relations reform. They opposed waterfront reform. And, of course, they opposed the introduction of a broad based indirect tax, under their policy which dares not speak its name but which begins with the R-word.The fifth thing the author said, which really caught my eye, was that Labor's new policy will focus on the productive capacity of the economy, with an emphasis on productivity, participation and population. I thought to myself, 'Where have I heard that before - the law of the three Ps?' I modestly refer the House to a speech I gave on 7 August 2002 where I said this:Today I am going to frame the law of the three Ps. They are population, participation and productivity.Unfortunately, I forgot to put a 'C' for 'copyright' on my speech. I do sincerely say to the learned author that they are five things that keep interest rates low and they are five things which this government has put in place; and the endorsement of coalition policy by the Australian Labor Party is warmly to be welcomed.</DOC>

 - Can I start by apologising to the House for being a little delayed; I was speaking on the phone to the Iraqi Prime Minister when question time began. This provided me with an opportunity, on behalf of all Australians, to convey our great gratitude to his government, to the brave people of Iraq and, in particular, to the military forces of Iraq. It was a detachment of the Second Battalion, 1st Iraqi Army Brigade - supported, I believe, by force elements of the United States - that effected the military rescue and recovery of Mr Wood. Another Iraqi hostage was also released and two insurgents were arrested.I very warmly welcome the fact - and I know that all members of the House will equally welcome the fact - that this rescue was accomplished by the Iraqi forces. What that says is that evidence is building of growing competence and capacity on the part of the Iraqi military and the Iraqi security forces. Whatever views people may have about the coalition operation in Iraq, we are surely united in the desire to see a free, independent and democratic Iraq. Strong security and military forces are indispensable to a free, independent and democratic Iraq.Along with the Foreign Minister, I had the opportunity this morning after the news conference of having morning tea with Mr Wood's family, a very impressive group of Australians - a group of men and women who care for their brother and brother-in-law and uncle but also understood what was involved. I want to say again that the strength, the dignity and the resolve of the Wood family have been an inspiration to everybody associated with this event. I again record my thanks to them.The best advice I have is that, notwithstanding his current ailments, which have been documented in the past, Mr Wood is in a reasonably good physical condition. As to whether there will be any lasting psychological impacts, I am in no professional position to comment and am not in receipt of any advice in relation to that. He has clearly been through a traumatic experience and one that has come the way of only few people.This is a remarkable event. I think perhaps only two or three out of the several thousand people who have been taken hostage in Iraq have been rescued. That is amazing. All of us can find whatever expression we want - whether he has a guardian angel, whether it is just sheer good luck or however we describe it - but it is a remarkable thing. Do not forget that he was rescued by the military forces of free Iraq. That is very significant.The Leader of the Opposition has asked me about recognition. Specifically, attention has not been given to that. Generally, yes, it will be. There are many people to be recognised. I think, for persistence of effort, pride of place - apart, of course, from Mr Wood's family - must go to Mr Nick Warner, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the head of the emergency task group that was sent within 24 hours to Baghdad. They worked in very close professional harmony with the Americans and also with the Iraqi forces.I again record my thanks to members of the Islamic community of Australia for the compassion and support that they displayed. This was a united Australia trying to achieve the freedom of one of our fellow countrymen. That was a message that went around the world. It is also a reminder that countries should not give in when extortionate demands are made. It is a reminder of the importance of the resolve that was displayed on that particular score. As to the greater details of the operation, as more information is available either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or I, consistent with any operational considerations, will make that information available.In my conversation with the Prime Minister of Iraq, he indicated to me a growing confidence in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to deal with the security situation in his country. He took the opportunity of expressing his gratitude for the ongoing support of the Australian forces in Iraq, and I assured him on behalf of the government that those forces would remain in his country until their job was completed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. As the House knows, Mr Douglas Wood was kept in captivity for 47 days. Inevitably it is difficult to piece together all the details surrounding his release, but the best that we are able to articulate at the moment is as follows. There was what is called a military 'cordon and search' operation in Baghdad which involved Iraqi forces, supported by American forces. The Iraqi unit involved was the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Iraqi Army Brigade. We understand that some intelligence was passed on to the 2nd Battalion forces. As a result, they raided a location in the suburb of Ghazaliya in Baghdad, and that was where they found Mr Wood and also another hostage who had been taken. Obviously as time goes on we hope to get a more comprehensive picture, and as we get a more comprehensive picture we are happy to brief the opposition or, perhaps during the course of next week, provide a bit more information to the House, because there is no doubt there is a good deal of interest in the details of how this happened.Mr Wood is now being protected by the Australian Emergency Response Team in Baghdad. He has undergone medical checks, and the House will be pleased to know that he is well. He has spoken on the phone to members of his family. We expect that Mr Wood will move out of Iraq during the course of today, Baghdad time, and go to another location in the Middle East. We will not say publicly where that location is in order to avoid a media scrum on his arrival, but I would be happy to privately brief members who may be interested.The government always made it clear - and I think the parliament always made it clear, the opposition as well as the government - that no Australian government can ever give in to the demands of hostage takers. An Australian government cannot pay ransoms and should not allow its policies to be changed as a result of the demands of hostage takers. On this occasion we stuck to our policy. We were supported by the opposition in doing that - which made it a lot easier - and, very importantly, the Wood family supported that policy as well. It is one thing when you do not have any direct family involvement, but for those involved in the family to have supported that policy showed extraordinary courage, and they deserve the highest praise for the courage that they showed. So Douglas Wood has been released without Australia paying any ransom and without Australia conceding to the policy demands of people who would take Australians hostage. That will always be our position, and I know the opposition supports that.We are happy to provide more information, particularly privately in briefings to members of parliament who might be interested, on the full saga over the 47 days - what my department did; what some of our friends and allies did; what the Iraqis did; and what Sheikh Hilaly, who played a very prominent role, did.Of course, during this whole saga there were moments when we did not know whether Douglas Wood was dead or alive. There were two videos which were made public. There was also a third video that we received on 29 May. In that video, Douglas Wood looked in good health, and that gave us some confidence - obviously he was alive, and from the statements he made it was clear that the video had only been made a day or two before. It was delivered to the Australian team in the form of a memory stick - one of those small memory sticks you put in a computer. We were told that the existence of this video was not to be made public at all, so we endeavoured to keep that reasonably quiet at the time. But at least we were aware up until quite recently that Douglas Wood was not only alive but looked as though he was in good health.Finally, let me reiterate what the Prime Minister said, and that was that we pay enormous tribute to the Iraqis, to the Americans and to those from other countries who helped us. By the way, quite a lot of people from other countries helped us in this - the Italians and the French. Some of the eastern Europeans who have had their citizens taken hostage were extremely helpful with advice and in giving us contacts and so on to follow up. But the Iraqis themselves were tremendously committed to trying to get Douglas Wood released - and obviously the Americans were as well, as you would expect.Our team did a great job. As the Prime Minister has already done, we thank Nick Warner, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff, the Australian Defence Force staff, the Australian Federal Police and others. I want to reiterate our thanks and support to the Iraqi people. There was a great quote by Colonel Mohammed, the Iraqi colonel who did a press conference with Nick Warner a few hours ago. He said:This is a great day for Iraq.That really plays into what the Prime Minister has been saying. It was a great day for Iraq, but of course, whatever our politics, we in this House all feel it was a great day for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. If he really understood this area of government policy he would know that the government has responsibility for governance as opposed to the day-to-day maintenance of safety issues. It is certainly the case that the government, after consideration by cabinet, resolved to proceed in relation to airspace upgradings in this country. That was a matter of policy. In terms of my responsibility in governance terms, it was entirely in my remit to indicate that I wanted government policy to be taken forward. That is not and does not constitute interference in day-to-day safety management.While I am on my feet, can I say this. Yesterday in this place the member for Perth waved around a brochure which I had released in my electorate about safety and claimed that the photograph showed that the worker involved was not properly protected. When we provided him with an enlarged photograph -  - We showed him the evidence, in an enlarged photograph, that the worker was properly protected and had what was required in that factory workplace. When asked about it this morning, the member for Perth fudged. - The member for Perth is trying to imply that I am not concerned about the safety of Australians. As I say, when presented with the evidence that the worker was well protected, he fudged this morning by saying that he was talking about a range of safety gear required to have been worn by the worker, not merely ear and eye protection. I invite the member for Perth to seek a briefing from us. We have checked it out very carefully. That worker was in full and absolute compliance with the workplace safety requirements of their workplace.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. It is a very important question about a very important topic. As members would now be starting to understand, and as the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers all agreed recently, Australia has a very, very good health system. The challenge is to make a good system even better.The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the most important parts of our health system, but its costs have been growing at a compound rate of some 12 per cent per year. During the election campaign, the government announced that new generic drugs entering the PBS would be subject to a mandatory 12½ per cent price cut, saving some $800 million over the then forward estimates period. A generic drug is one which has a chemically identical active ingredient to an existing drug. The government is implementing this policy and I am happy to tell the House that all the new generics listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on 1 August will do so at a 12½ per cent price cut.Unfortunately, there are a few companies with drugs already on the PBS who have not accepted the flow-on price cut. To avoid the withdrawal of these drugs from the market, those companies can charge patients a premium on top of the standard co-payment. The critical point is this -  - I say this to the member for Lalor, who does not ask any questions - who just pulls stunts in the parliament these days, because she is not allowed to ask any questions by her tactics committee -  - I say to the member for Lalor: every patient -  - every single patient will have access to a clinically suitable drug at the standard co-payment, mostly because there will be an alternative drug at the benchmark price; and, in a minority of cases, where the patient's doctor believes there is no clinically suitable alternative, the doctor will be able to seek an authority from the Health Insurance Commission and in those cases the government will pay the premium.The government is determined to ensure that the PBS makes better use of generics. The government is determined to ensure that taxpayers get the best possible deal. I should point out to the member for Lalor that, just because of the entry of generic statins onto the PBS as a result of this measure, there will be a savings of $400 million over the forward estimates period. The government is determined -  - to ensure that no patient will be disadvantaged where there is a genuine clinical need. This government is determined to balance all these important, but sometimes competing, objectives. We are determined to balance these things. We are capable of doing it. We do not engage in irresponsible scaremongering like the member for Lalor. That is why the Australian people are prepared to trust the Howard government with their health care and that is why the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare ever had - the best Prime Minister that Medicare ever had and the best Treasurer that Medicare ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I cannot report on the nature of conversations that might or might not have taken place between the secretary of my department and CASA. It is highly appropriate for them to talk and to talk often - they did and they still do. I am happy to ask my department whether the then secretary had a conversation or conversations at that time. But I do not believe for a moment that my office or my department would have interfered in operational safety matters because I have always been absolutely fastidious and insistent with the statutory authorities that have responsibility for aviation safety in Australia that they must never compromise the safety of the travelling public of this nation. And I believe that the government and all members of this House would expect nothing less.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and I applaud his continued advocacy for further workplace relations reform in this country. Under the Howard government, the level of strikes in Australia has consistently been at its lowest level since records were kept - and that goes back to 1913. Indeed, the December 2004 quarterly result was the lowest quarterly result ever.It is against this background that I note the unions have promised a nationwide week of action at the end of June this year. Some of the comments being made about this are a cause for concern. Last Saturday, Chris Cain, the Western Australian secretary of the Maritime Union, told a meeting of unionists at the Victorian Trades Hall:If you believe in rank and file trade unionism, you have to break the law ... Because I break the law every day and sooner or later we're going to have casualties when we do, but if we do it en masse, then we'll win ...If that statement were not regrettable enough, Mr Cain then went on to endorse the tactics of one Craig Johnston, who was, I should point out to the House, recently released from jail as a result of being imprisoned for violent raids on two Melbourne businesses as part of a union campaign in 2001. Mr Cain went on to say:I just believe the type of trade unionism Craig Johnston has brought to Victoria and around the country needs to be put on more to more unionists around the country ...Craig Johnston shared the stage at the Victorian Trades Hall Council with Chris Cain last Saturday. Barely a week after being released from jail for violent acts, including against a pregnant woman in a Melbourne business, he was being given star billing at the Trades Hall Council in Victoria.Government members - Shame! - It is a shame. According to reports by AAP:Mr Johnston called for support of the Labor party in the next three years, saying they were the best chance for getting reform.Mr Johnston is quoted as saying:We need them to say industrial relations is a political issue ... and they can repeal all the current laws.Quite clearly, Mr Johnston got what he wanted, because the next day we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that he would do exactly what Johnston had demanded. The re-emergence of Johnston - this is a serious issue for the Labor Party - and this tactic of lawless activity are a test for the moral fibre of the Labor Party and the ACTU. What they must do, in light of these public comments from Johnston, is dissociate themselves from these comments by Johnston and from his supporters. That is the test.The issue is: Johnston having being drummed out of the AMWU, what is the Leader of the Opposition going to say when, as is widely reported, he turns up as a member of the Victorian branch of the CFMEU? What is the Leader of the Opposition going to say then? If he is not going to dissociate himself from the likes of Craig Johnston and say that this man, his associates and these sorts of tactics to be undertaken by unionists in this country are inappropriate, are we then to conclude that militant unionism is the type of roll back that the Leader of the Opposition has in mind?</DOC>

 - I can advise the member for Perth that CASA and indeed I have had some concern about some of the overrepresentation of aviation safety incidents in the north of Australia. As a result, particular attention has been paid to consultations between CASA and airline operators. That has sometimes been the subject of quite a bit of toing-and-froing between some of the local members and me. I believe that real progress is being made, but no advice has come to me that we need any further investigation. Since I am meeting with CASA this afternoon - or I think it might be Monday - I will pursue that matter on the member's behalf. Aviation safety is something that concerns us all, and I would never seek to be political about something as sensitive and as important as aviation safety.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I know he is strongly supportive of states' rights when it comes to rugby, but he is driving national consistency in standards in literacy and numeracy across Australia. The Australian government is delivering $33 billion to Australian schools over the next four years. For the first time the Australian government has put conditions on that funding, which include a national starting age for schooling, national testing in literacy and numeracy, and plain language report cards to parents about the progress their children are making through the school system. In fact, I read today in the Courier Mail under 'Literacy testing set for year 9s':QUEENSLAND Year 9 students will be required to sit for national literacy and numeracy tests from 2007.And:The increased testing and reporting against minimum standards has been driven by - the Australian government, which - says parents need more information about how their children are performingAt the moment there are four jurisdictions in Australia which are yet to sign and will have to sign in the next two weeks otherwise $7½ billion will be withheld from those state and territory governments for schools funding. The principle reason why those states and territories are refusing to sign is that they are opposed to plain language reports to parents about the progress that their children are making. The government are requiring that school reports will be reported in 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E'. The average parent knows exactly what that means. In addition to that, we are requiring the states to actually rank into which quartile, or which 25 per cent, in the classroom the parents' son or daughter is falling.The people that are delivering the opposition to this very sensible reform are the same people that are delivering reports to parents today that, for example, will report children's progress in class as 'almost achieved', 'working towards', whatever that means, 'needs attention' or 'consolidating' - all this politically correct language-denuded explanation which does not mean a damn thing to the average parent in Australia. This government are determined that there will be national consistency in Australia. There will be plain language reporting to parents. We will withhold money from states and territories unless they sign up.As far as the Labor Party is concerned, I heard the Leader of the Opposition this morning on radio, and he was asked about his tax policy. He basically said, 'It's almost achieving.' What does that mean? To the average parent, as far as this government's school reports are concerned, Labor's opposition to tax cuts for Australia on 1 July would be rated an 'E' - in other words, crashed and burned. They would be in the bottom 25 per cent of the class. As far as his frontbench is concerned, he would probably report them as 'needs attention.'</DOC>

 - I again thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Let me note at the outset that he is attempting to put words in my mouth. I indicated and acknowledged that there is something of an overrepresentation of aviation safety incidents. That can mean reportage of inadequate maintenance or whatever. That is a far different thing to conceding any point in relation to an overrepresentation with regard to actual fatalities. The other point I would make is that the member just a few moments ago was implying that I should not directly involve myself in operational safety. I do not. He apparently now wants me to.CASA, I believe, has been doing a very competent job in this regard. I have confidence in CASA. I make the point that we inherited a very unsatisfactory mess from the Labor Party some years ago. CASA was on the front pages of the newspapers every other day. I think its performance has been lifted very considerably indeed. I think Australians, broadly speaking, have confidence in CASA, as I have confidence in CASA, and I think that is a significant improvement over the situation that pertained some years ago. Mr Speaker, I am happy to have CASA explain, in any forum that you so choose - and you often do over in the Senate - its rationale for decisions that it has made in these matters. I will seek any further information that might be required and provide it to you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson and acknowledge her interest in matters that go to the alleviation of poverty across the world. Of course Australia plays a very strong role, a leading role, in a number of policy areas in poverty alleviation across the world. Most importantly, our advocacy of trade liberalisation, particularly in the agriculture sector, is critical to our pursuits, along with other developed countries, in achieving a better outcome for the world's poor. It is an undeniable fact that agricultural protection depresses global prices for agricultural goods and severely restricts the abilities of developing countries to lift their economies and lift the many people in their populations out of poverty.Many members would have seen the comments overnight by the new head of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz, who called on wealthy countries to reduce agricultural subsidies to boost trade prospects for developing nations. His comments are not just aimed at the European Union and Japan but also at his own country, the United States of America. This follows a World Bank analysis that estimates that ending farm support would lift 140 million people out of poverty and deliver a $600 billion gain to the global economy. This could happen if those wealthy countries that excessively support and protect agriculture were prepared to liberalise their agricultural markets.Interestingly, the British PM Tony Blair is again demonstrating leadership by battling his European Union counterparts on European Union reductions to farm subsidies. The Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain is showing great leadership and moral courage in this regard. It is said that the average European cow receives $2 a day in taxpayer support. That is more than half the world's poor have to live on in a year.Earlier this year at the Davos economic forum in Switzerland our Prime Minister told world economic leaders that aid alone will not end poverty. Liberalisation of trade, and of agricultural trade in particular, is also needed to help alleviate poverty across the world. So we are at the front of those nations calling on the developed countries of the world to liberalise their agricultural markets to give the developing world a chance to trade their way out of poverty.We also lead the way in other areas. We have announced that we will provide tariff-free and quota-free access to the 49 least developed countries in the world into our market in Australia to try to assist those countries to develop their economies. Debt forgiveness is very important and aid is admirable, but they will not work without trade liberalisation.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that I have not been advised to the contrary. I can confirm, too, that this tragic accident is still the subject of an inquiry by the ATSB - as it ought to be; a no-blame investigation which will be thorough and far-reaching. I think it fair to say that if CASA had found it necessary to ground this airline it would have done so. I also make the point that some allegations have been made against this airline which, if you like, have been unsubstantiated. When I have asked the people who have made those complaints to come forward -  - Do you want the answer or not? They have not been prepared to come forward and substantiate those concerns. I make the point again that, if people feel they have something they can usefully contribute to the current inquiry into this very unfortunate accident - this is a no-blame investigation - I plead with them to come forward in the interests of aviation safety and our management of it in this country, because it is a very important matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. I remind the House that on budget night the Treasurer announced the abolition of the superannuation surcharge for all Australians, to take effect from 1 July. A total of 600,000 Australian would benefit from this abolition, to the tune of $2.5 billion over the forward estimates, meaning that more Australians would be able to put something away for their future without the imposition of this additional surcharge.It is my melancholy duty to inform the House that the measure has been defeated in the Senate. And who has it been defeated by? By the Labor Party. On the same day that they came into this place and tried to say that Australians should not get a tax cut, they were in the other place saying that the superannuation surcharge should remain in place. Shame on the Labor Party!The Labor Party may want to reject tax cuts and to continue to impose this tax of $2.5 billion on Australians but from 1 July, regardless of what the Labor Party does, the coalition will ensure the surcharge is removed. That is a rock solid guarantee. It means that the Labor Party will be deemed to be irrelevant to the debate, because when the new Senate is in place this side of the House will ensure that we deliver on that commitment.Industry is saying to the Leader of the Opposition that Labor should get behind the government. ASPA has said, 'Let's make the execution of the unpopular super surcharge swift and clean and allow one million Australians to be a bit better off.' That is a great sentiment. ISFA has said: The 'nays' have got this wrong ... by rejecting this bill they have rejected good policy. 
And in today's Australian a financial executive described Labor's plan as 'a feeble attempt to fuel the politics of envy'. We all know where the politics of envy come from, don't we, Member for Lilley? Everything is about the politics of envy. I inform the House and the Australian population that this government, the Howard-Costello government, will ensure the super surcharge is removed from 1 July, even if we have to wait for the implementation of the new Senate after July.</DOC>

We are very proud of the responses to the three inquiries that we have set up. The first went to the standard of fixed line services, the second concentrated largely on mobile services and the third focused on the issue of telecommunications that is of real importance to rural and regional Australia: the provision of broadband. I want to emphasise this point in particular. - The debate about telecommunications in the future, for all Australians including rural Australians, will be about the provision of bandwidth for new technologies that are coming on stream. I will tell you what real leadership on telecommunications is. It is about making sure that we get the timely delivery of those new technologies rather than holding people back in a horse and sulky age. We are committed to the Estens recommendations. The HiBIS scheme in particular has been highly successful. I think we are making very good progress. There is no backing away from our commitments whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for all of the good work that he does with small business in his electorate. Ninety-five per cent of all business in this country is small business. It is vital for our economic growth, for creating jobs and for innovation. This government understands the needs of small business and understands that the workplace needs to be flexible to meet the needs of small businesses and their workers. The government's new workplace relations system will be simpler, it will be easier to understand, it will cut red tape and it will be less costly for small business. - Let me tell you what one small businessman said. Mr Mick Martin, who runs his own roofing business, said that small businesses are being strangled by regulations and simplifying the system is vital. -  - They can interject as much as they like, but they do not understand the needs of Mr Martin and others like him. Mr Martin says: 'I like the way it's going to be simpler.' It is clear that the improvements that this government will be making to the workplace relations system will help in cutting that red tape, in creating more jobs, in ensuring that productivity levels are increased and in increasing real wages. Small businesspeople like Mr Martin understand that. This government understands that. If those opposite had the slightest interest in small business, they would support what this government is doing.</DOC>

We cannot help being the Commonwealth government at the time of the Commonwealth Games, any more than Mr Bracks can help being the Premier of Victoria at the time. I know how low-key he is in promoting the games. And why wouldn't he want to promote the sporting glories of the city of Melbourne, which is undoubtedly in so many ways the sporting capital of Australia. -  - This is my last word: after a question like that I am more than ever convinced that the baton will always remain on this side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member very much for his question. On Tuesday night I had the pleasure of presenting the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards, and what a great success the night was. The awards recognise excellence in achievement under the successful Work for the Dole program. Finalists from all over Australia attended the function, which highlighted the diversity of participants, supervisors and individual activities conducted during 2004. Indeed, 370 nominations were narrowed down to three winners.I say by way of congratulations, particularly to the member for Bass - who was there on the night and had spoken to me about the award recipients from Tasmania - that one of the recipients on the night was the Mount Barrow historic forest trail in Launceston, which won the award for the best Work for the Dole activity. Participants in that program employ traditional techniques to recreate the roads and huts of forest workers in Tasmania in the 1900s. Congratulations to that organisation. I also make mention of Angela Field, who won the best participant award for her participation in Adventure Assisting Youth in Lithgow, New South Wales. She said, 'I never thought that Work for the Dole could change my life but it did.'I also want to mention Robert Mackie from the Rotary Club Safety Cycle Centre in Katherine, Northern Territory. Senator Scullion and the member for Solomon spoke to me about that excellent program. It is a wonderful program in the Northern Territory. Work for the Dole has been an incredibly successful program. I note that also in attendance on the night were a few members from the ALP. Unbelievably, they were there. They were most welcome. They joined many members from this side of the parliament in celebrating what has been a fantastic program. I will be having a little bit more to say about those people in the near future.</DOC>

 - The House will have an opportunity this week to have a look at the changes to the Migration Act. Given the interest that the Leader of the Opposition is displaying by asking his first question, I assume that the Labor Party will swiftly give passage to the amendments through the Senate.Let me go to the substance. The changes will reflect the announcement I made on Friday - that is, that children would only be in a detention centre as a last resort. The objective of the changes is, as far as humanly practicable and consistent with that principle, that families with children should be in residence detention - in other words, in the community, but still legally having the status of detention. It would not be involving 24-hour guard, might I say, but would be involving conditions that would be adjusted according to the circumstances of each case.Now that I am on my feet, I want to take the opportunity of saying that the changes that the government has outlined are, I believe, valuable improvements, but they do not in any way undermine the framework of the current policy. The current policy retains mandatory detention. It is mandatory detention with a softer edge, but nonetheless mandatory detention.The other elements of the policy - such as the excision of offshore islands, still opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and offshore processing, still opposed by the Australian Labor Party - remain. What the government has done is recognise the views of many in its own ranks to the effect that, whilst maintenance of the policy of mandatory detention is absolutely fundamental, there is room to provide more flexibility in relation to children. There is also room to provide a non-compellable review mechanism in the hands of the Ombudsman in relation to people who have been in detention for more than two years. There will be a mechanism to accelerate the processing of those currently on temporary protection visas who have applied for permanent protection visas. There are a number of other incidental changes, all designed to accelerate the time taken to process applications, it being a constant in complaints that I have received, particularly from my own colleagues across the whole spectrum of the government parties, that, whatever views people may have on this or that aspect of mandatory detention, it is desirable that decisions be reached as quickly as possible and with a great deal more dispatch.As I said, those parts of the provisions that are needed to be given effect to in legislation are going to be introduced this week. I welcome the interest of the Leader of the Opposition and I would welcome even more the support of his party so that we do not have a repetition of the nonsense over taxation and we can put the amendments through fairly quickly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and the interest she shows in Iraq. Over the last two years, despite the obvious difficulties there have been for Iraq as a country, it has made considerable progress. The historic elections were held in January and now a broadly representative government in Iraq has been installed. The economy is slowly but surely being revived. Iraq's relations with neighbouring countries and the international community are being normalised.Of course, there are many challenges that still remain in Iraq. Australia is prepared to give support. We have forgiven $850 million in debt. In the recent budget we announced a further $45 million in reconstruction, building on the $126 million we have already provided. We will be represented at the international conference on Iraq this Wednesday in Brussels. I will not be going myself, because the House is sitting, but a senior official from my department will be representing Australia there.It hardly needs to be said that security and public order issues remain a significant challenge in Iraq. We strongly support democracy in Iraq. We support the new democratic movement there. So do the vast majority of the people of Iraq. Of course, there are elements of people who supported and were part of Saddam Hussein's vicious and inhumane regime who are perpetrating acts of terror and violence, and there are the al-Qaeda and al-Zarqawi terrorists in Iraq, who are doing the same thing. But, as an international community, we need to get behind the bulk of the Iraqi people and make sure that the new Iraqi democracy is able to emerge and to flourish. Part of that is ensuring that the Iraqis are responsible for their own security. For that to happen, we have to train Iraqis.This is a government that has given a strong commitment to the training of the Iraqi security forces. We will continue to do so for some time into the future. As Douglas Wood said this morning, he is 'proof positive' that the decision to train Iraqi troops is the right decision. There is simply no question about that.I do not know if the House needed reminding, but I will remind the House anyway that this government is committed to playing its part in helping the people of Iraq build their security and their democracy. As my Iraqi counterpart, Foreign Minister Sabri, said on the Lateline program last week:I think the Australian troops are doing a wonderful job here. We are grateful ...</DOC>

They showed that the total number of dwelling unit commencements fell 2.2 per cent in March and is down 14.1 per cent over the year. This is consistent with what I have been informing the House of for some time - a slowing in the housing market from the unsustainable levels that we saw in the earlier part of this decade. Provided that growth can rebalance out of domestic sources to international sources, that is to be warmly welcomed.Also released today was ABARE's publication Australian Commodities Outlook for the June quarter, where ABARE forecast that Australia's commodity exports would increase 15 per cent, to a record $116 billion, in 2005-06. This is underpinned by a forecast 23 per cent increase in the export of Australia's minerals and energy, with both volumes and values up. With values in relation to contracts negotiated in April lasting for 12 months, you would not expect to see any change in those prices into 2006, probably the June quarter. Notwithstanding the increase in minerals and energy exports, ABARE is expecting a fall in farm production of 5.8 per cent in 2005-06. This is principally the result of the drought which is gripping much of Australia - although these forecasts were made before the Bureau of Meteorology, on Friday, upgraded its forecast for rain to a 50 per cent chance of rainfall being averaged in the September quarter. So there might be a bit of upside risk in relation to that.If the Australian economy can reweight out of domestic sources to international sources, particularly led by those strong export performances, that will provide the basis for ongoing growth - growth which has already led to 1.6 million jobs, I believe, being created and the lowest unemployment in Australia for 29 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have no knowledge of the claim that he makes in relation to Dimbulah. But, in relation to our genuine efforts to do something about the very weakened social and economic circumstances of the Atherton Tablelands, I would remind the member that we have a local advisory committee, which reports to my department within strict guidelines, and we have accepted the advice that has come through to us in the normal ways. There has been no interference - no attempt to behave politically in this instance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I can inform him that, over the weekend, world oil prices hit an all-time record high. Principally, oil prices are high because of demand factors. Of the 9.2 million barrel per day increase in demand between 1997 and 2004, China alone accounted for 25 per cent of that demand. That was not, of course, the cause of the spike over the weekend. The cause of the spike over the weekend, where world prices went to $US58 per barrel, was civil unrest in Nigeria, which is a major oil producer.It has been estimated by the IMF and the OECD that, for every $10 a barrel increase in the price of oil, OECD growth would reduce by 0.4 of a per cent. So, given the fact that we have had a $US20 per barrel increase over the last year, this modelling suggests that that would knock off three-quarters of a percentage point of growth in the OECD and, of course, would knock growth off Australia. Higher oil prices contribute to higher petrol prices at the pump. Motorists are already feeling the pinch and, if these oil prices remain, may continue to do so for some time.Can I point out to the House that the Commonwealth government has a fixed excise of 38c a litre which does not increase as the price increases. It is true that GST also applies to petrol, and all GST goes to the eight Labor states and territories. Can I also point out to the honourable member for Barker that this is the government that ensured full diesel rebates for agricultural industry and mining industry, that cut diesel for interstate transport from 44c to 20c and that also announced an extension in relation to its energy white paper for power generation and off-road use as that energy white paper comes into effect. So this is a government which has reduced excises for transport, preserved full rebates for agriculture and fixed petrol excise at 38c a litre without any indexation for inflation. We sympathise with motorists bearing these high world oil prices, but those prices that you now see are not the creation of taxation but of international factors.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and appreciate the interest he shows in this issue. I think all members of the House agree with the Australian government's position that we strongly oppose Japan's plans to expand its so-called scientific whaling program. Whale stock numbers do remain under threat and it is clear that Japan's whaling program cannot reasonably be described as just scientific. Scientists from more than half the countries of the International Whaling Commission, including Australia, have refused to review Japan's new proposals until an independent review of their original scientific whaling program is undertaken, and I think that is entirely reasonable.Australian diplomatic missions around the world have been coordinating with like-minded countries to make known to the Japanese government our concerns with their proposals. Our ambassador in Japan, Murray McLean, has led two delegations of diplomats to the Japanese foreign ministry and fisheries agency to urge Japan to cease its scientific whaling program, and over 15 countries have now participated in these representations. In the past two weeks Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, has visited five European and three Pacific island countries to lobby for support for Australia's opposition to scientific whaling. The Prime Minister and I have made representations directly to our counterparts in numerous International Whaling Commission member states, seeking their support for our position.Senator Campbell will be working with antiwhaling nations at this week's IWC meeting in Korea to urge Japan to cease its scientific whaling program, and obviously we hope we can be successful. We have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options to bring further pressure to Japan if that is necessary, but we obviously have to work these things through carefully, step by step, and particularly we are likely to be more effective if we coordinate our efforts with other like-minded countries in the international community and do not behave as a rogue country, doing things on our own and ignoring the cooperation that we otherwise would very naturally get from a large number of other countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware that Mr Warren Polglase is a member of the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. I make this point: I appoint the chair of each area consultative committee and it is up to the chair and members of each committee to decide its structure. The member has raised a series of very serious allegations. They are allegations - I make that point.I make the point that the New South Wales local government minister Tony Kelly announced the dismissal of the Tweed Shire Council in the New South Wales parliament on 25 May 2005. I note that that dismissal took place on the recommendation of an inquiry before the allegations had been thoroughly investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Isn't it more than passing strange that the New South Wales government allowed that to happen while we have other councils - Labor councils in the past - like Strathfield that have had similar allegations raised against them but have not been dismissed?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. He and Australians will be aware of the government's track record in boosting employment - some 1.6 million extra jobs since the Howard government has been in office and an increase in real wages of some 14 per cent. It is against this background that I note that the ACTU launched an advertising campaign over the weekend. Included in that campaign is an advertisement that implies workers with families could be sacked for refusing to work extra hours at short notice. The Workplace Relations Act will continue to provide protection against unlawful termination for discriminatory reasons. Set out in the Workplace Relations Act is a range of reasons which would make conduct unlawful, including religion, gender, union membership, pregnancy and family responsibilities - the very thing this ad was aimed at. The ad is quite wrong. Employers in Australia who terminate an employee for discriminatory reasons, including for family responsibilities, are liable for fines, penalties and compensation under the legislation. That is the first ad that was wrong.The second ad which is being run by the ACTU is also wrong. It depicts an existing employee who has been employed for 15 years. The ad says of the existing employee that under the new system, 'You can be forced onto an individual contract.' Again this is wrong. It is and will continue to be unlawful under the Workplace Relations Act for an employer to use duress in forcing an existing employee onto an Australian workplace agreement. That is the law now and it will be the law in the future.Furthermore - and this is how wrong this ad is - all employees who are offered AWAs have the right to have a bargaining agent appointed to represent them. This bargaining agent can include a representative of a union, and an employer must respect the decision by the employee and is obliged to deal with a bargaining agent under the law. What the ACTU ad failed to point out is that the man in question had the legal right to have a union official sitting next to him. He could have had Greg Combet or Sharan Burrow if they were interested in his situation, if they were interested in actually representing Australian workers rather than scaring them.This goes to the point of what this campaign is about. It is a political campaign and it is a scare campaign. At a union rally in Sydney Mr Combet said, 'What is going to be in the back of people's minds when they are offered an AWA is: can I be sacked if I refuse to sign?' In an ACTU press release on 2 June Sharan Burrow said, 'Workers who refuse to sign may fear being sacked.' What is the ACTU doing about this fear? Did it service its members by attempting to educate them about what the law actually says? Did it reassure workers in Australia that it will be unlawful for them to be sacked in such circumstances? Did it provide them with honest and accurate advice? No, no, no. This is simply a dishonest scare campaign from the ACTU. It is also a desperate campaign, given Ms Burrow said she would do whatever it takes. Obviously it involves insulting the intelligence of ordinary workers in Australia with blatantly incorrect information.It is reported that the ACTU is expending $8 million on this campaign. It is obviously designed to promote as much fear as possible. If there are any further ads along these lines in this campaign then the bottom line is that no Australian worker can trust the word of the ACTU when it comes to explaining this legislation. It is all about scare. It is dishonest and it is wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and recognise his keen interest in our export performance, particularly as it relates to his part of Queensland that relies heavily on the exports coming out of the electorate of Hinkler. Australian jobs and growth in living standards have always been directly connected to our ability to export what we manufacture and what we produce and the services we provide out of Australia. The more goods and services that we can sell into the international marketplace obviously the stronger our economic performance will be. As far as employment is concerned it is a well-known fact that one in five Australian jobs rely on an export industry. That becomes even stronger in rural and regional Australia and in electorates like that of the member for Hinkler where one in four jobs relies on our export performance. I am very pleased to inform the House that Australian exports reached their highest monthly level ever in April. They are growing at nine per cent -  - to reach an output of $14.6 billion. This is the strongest monthly exports growth since the Olympics in September 2000 and it is the highest monthly level ever recorded. - Notwithstanding the impacts of drought that have beset Australia's agricultural producers not just this year but in years gone by, Australia's exports are now firmly on track to achieve a record level in both value and volume terms in 2004-05. - This result reinforces the government's commitment to opening up markets and to supporting our agenda of trade liberalisation across the world and, of course, our efforts in promoting and supporting Australia's exporters. It also highlights the importance of maintaining an open and competitive economy. We have endeavoured to do that in our term in office by reforming the Australian economy and undertaking important reforms in the Australian workplace. But it underlines the important fact that we must continue those reforms in the workplace. We need to continue the reforms that we have outlined to Australia's workplace relations to maintain our competitive edge in the international marketplace.</DOC>

You can never take anything as read that you hear from the other side. I would be a little wary about judging people before they have had a proper hearing.

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for the question and acknowledge the role that he has been playing in Northern Tasmania, particularly with the difficulties that potato growers and other fruit and vegetable producers in Northern Tasmania have been facing over recent times. I acknowledge especially his role in negotiating a $200,000 contribution from the federal government under the Industry Partnerships program to help potato growers to find solutions to the problems that they currently face.I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in some areas of the media that imported foods to Australia are likely to be contaminated with chemicals and pesticides and the like. I want to assure the House that imported foods are required to meet exactly the same food safety standards as food produced in Australia. The Food Standards Code, which was developed by the Australian and New Zealand food standards setting organisation, applies to all foods whether produced in this country or imported. A testing regime is in place to ensure that food coming into this country meets those standards. In some instances there are minimum levels of pesticides permitted in some products, but where residue limits are in place they apply equally for imported foods as they do for Australia foods.The House may be interested to know that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has over the last five years tested 1,254 consignments of fresh fruit and vegetables that have come into Australia, and only three of those consignments have failed the pesticides residue limits tests. Naturally, those products were refused entry, and future imports from those producers were subject to detailed scrutiny. So the law applies to everyone. There are no special concessions or different rules of any kind provided to fruit and vegetables coming from other parts of the world, whether they come under a free trade agreement or any other system.The other point I would like to make is that I think it is very important for consumers to be aware that they can identify Australian fruit and vegetables because imported fruit and vegetables are required to be labelled with their country of origin. It is the law now. This government supports the law which requires imported fruit and vegetables to be labelled with their country of origin. If there are fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts or seafood that have come from another part of the world, they will be clearly labelled that they come from whatever country they have been produced in. Those laws have been in place for some time. If consumers come across examples where those laws are being flouted then they need to raise those issues with the various state departments which have responsibility for enforcing them. But this government believes that consumers have a right to know where their products come from and it has in place appropriate legislation to ensure that happens. It is really a matter for consumers whether they want imported food, fruit and vegetables to come into this country. They are labelled. If they don't want them, don't buy them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for this question. The Skills at work report which she is referring to in fact has shown that the total numbers of apprentices in training is up, completions are up, the range of incentives and the number of employers actually accessing those apprentice incentives are also up. It is also interesting to note that on 10 June Minister Nelson and I attended a ministerial council meeting, and the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers were all at one about this report showing that things were very good in the area of new apprenticeship training and that things are so good in fact that we have some reason to celebrate. - The member for Jagajaga asked about the Skills at work report. We believe in outcomes, we believe also in accountability and we are always happy to make that information available to her. It is interesting how she has taken a small part of a small part of a small part of the report to try and drill down in such an incompetent misuse of the figures that it seems to me if she applied the same principle to those who are on the back bench opposite she might actually find a support base for herself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby, Dr Southcott, for his question and for the interest that he takes in this area of the portfolio. Australia does have a very good record in minimising the spread of HIV-AIDS and treating people who have this terrible disease. In part, this is the work of government. The Australian government, for instance, spends some $24 million a year on prevention and education programs and some $86 million a year on treatment. We also help to fund state government programs through the public health outcome funding agreements. But mostly this is because of the good work of the affected communities, whose leaders have consistently stressed the need to avoid high-risk behaviours.Last Friday the government announced the fifth National HIV-AIDS Strategy, which builds on the strengths of previous strategies. The government will continue to fund targeted prevention and education programs for people at risk. The government will continue funding for the four HIV-AIDS research centres until the middle of 2008 at the cost of an additional $12 million. And the government has made an in-principle decision to provide diagnostic testing for HIV-AIDS under Medicare. I want to make it very clear that HIV-AIDS is a health issue and not a moral issue. People with HIV-AIDS should be treated not judged. Minimising the spread of HIV-AIDS has been a partnership - a very successful partnership - between government and the community organisations concerned. I would like to congratulate those community organisations for the responsible attitude they have always adopted.</DOC>

 - The member for Werriwa was not here, in fact, when the report was released on 7 March. I simply remind him that the report was finalised in December 2004 and released on 7 March. It found that the number of completions of new apprenticeships has increased 280 per cent since 1996 over the 12 months to June 2003 and that around 120,500 new apprenticeships were completed. As I said in the answer to a previous question, this report has shown very clearly -  - The material that was released in recent days was all of the supplementary material which underscored the whole Skills at work report, which we were happy to release and which, again, underscored the success of the New Apprenticeships program. The Labor Party do not like it. They do not like the fact that young people in this country are making choices on a daily basis to go down pathways that are good for them and order success for them. - Let me tell you that 95 per cent of people have the ability to work as part of a team, 94 per cent use technology in the workplace, 91 per cent have communication skills. When you start to look at it, in fact, 96 per cent of those people participating in a new apprenticeship or traineeship would recommend it to others. At the end of the day, young Australians are making choices on an everyday basis in this country. The Labor Party, for some reason, has a job snobbery about the choices young people make.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. He is one of the long-term supporters of people choosing for themselves where they make their investments, and he has been a long-term advocate of superannuation in this country. Most people in this House, and most Australians, in fact, are aware that from 1 July many Australians for the first time will be able to make the choice of where they put their superannuation. They will be able to determine who it is that invests their money for their own retirement.From 1 July we are also changing the regulations - we put them to the House last Thursday - to give Australians the opportunity to move their fund - portability - without having to wait six months from the last employer contribution into their funds. In other words, when an Australian worker decides to move their funds to put that money where they want to see it invested, they will not have to wait for the bureaucracy to catch up. Those regulations will come into effect from 1 July.What we wait to see now is whether the Labor Party will change its stance from the one it took in September 2003 when it opposed Australians having that right of portability, leaving this long tail, in the same way it has opposed Australians choosing where they put their funds, in the same way it has opposed Australians having $2.5 billion removed from the super surcharge and in the same way it wants to reintroduce the work tests so that particularly women, when leaving the work force to have a family, can continue to contribute to their superannuation funds. Labor says that should not happen. In the same way, the Labor Party says Australians should not get $1.50 for every dollar that they put into superannuation in the form of a super co-contribution. It beggars belief that there is only one side of this House that strongly and consistently supports superannuation for Australian workers - that is the coalition. And the challenge is for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party either to get out of the way or to get on board.</DOC>

The Skills at work report, which is what she is asking about, has shown that there have been a record number of people undertaking new apprenticeships. There have been a record number of people completing new apprenticeships, a record number of businesses who are availing themselves -  - Those opposite have gone back to the old tactic of using points of order to ask questions over and over again. The point is that today we have enormous success in the area of apprenticeships in the trades, and enormous success in apprenticeships and traineeships in the non-traditional trades, and the Labor Party simply do not like it.</DOC>

 - At least it takes someone on this side of the House to understand absolutely clearly what is going on in the Australian economy today. Not only are we seeing record numbers of people taking up traineeships and apprenticeships in traditional trades but in the important retail sector of Australia, where we have something like 10 per cent of the employment growth over the past five years to February 2004 - that is almost 135,000 additional jobs - we are seeing a commitment to the training of young people and backing the choices that they make and which their families are proud of, as we have never seen before.On Saturday night, the member for Macarthur - the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Mr Farmer - and I attended the National Retail Association's awards event. We were able to see first-hand the enormous commitment of one of the powerhouses of the Australian economy to the young people they are taking into their industry. They are giving them not just part-time job prospects but long-term career prospects. The retail sector need to be congratulated for that. They are committed to innovation, and they are committed to full-time career potential. In fact, 1.8 million people are expected to be employed in retail by the end of this decade.We do not have job snobs on this side; we fully support the choices young people make. In fact, 20 per cent of the work force in the retail sector are people we could describe as young. Overall, we have in Australia 382,400 new apprentices in training. That is a 170 per cent increase in the last decade. We are providing almost $800 million for employer incentives and support. We are determined to continue this support, particularly for areas like the retail services sector. We want to make certain that they are not overlooked.It is 30 years since I cooked hamburgers at McDonald's at Mount Gravatt, but the commitment of the retail and services sector to training young people and providing opportunities for them to commence a long-term career in this sector is something this government fully supports.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and his ongoing interest in the subject of workplace relations reform. Almost 700,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into in Australia since they were introduced by this government. Indeed, what the data shows is that workers on Australian workplace agreements on average earn 100 per cent more than workers on awards - which are of course the ACTU's and the ALP's preferred alternative, it being the ALP's policy to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Our government believe in individual Australian workplace agreements because we believe in choice. We believe that individuals should have a choice to work under an AWA and they should have a choice to negotiate one with or without a union being involved. The reality is that the reason the Australian Labor Party is opposed to Australian workplace agreements is that they remove the guaranteed privileged position of the unions in relation to workplace arrangements.We currently have a highly misleading campaign being conducted by the ACTU. It is interesting that, when challenged by the government about the accuracy of the advertisements yesterday, the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, defiantly defended the ads. He said that somehow we were frightened of the ACTU. In light of this certainty from Mr Combet, I was surprised last night to read a lengthy three-page clarification that was posted on the ACTU web site. What this clarification does, in a nutshell, is acknowledge the truth of the government's allegations and criticisms against these misleading ads. If people go to the web site and read this clarification, they will see that it concedes that the woman in the first ad with the young family, who is said to have faced dismissal, would in fact be able to bring a claim for unlawful discrimination. We said that this was the case. This lengthy clarification, which the ACTU have snuck onto their web site overnight, is a concession that they were wrong about these ads. If they were wrong about that and were prepared to make that concession, they should issue another clarification: one which acknowledges that in cases of unlawful termination there is in fact a reverse onus of proof on the employer - that is, if an employee brings a claim for unlawful discrimination then the onus of proof is on the employer. The ACTU should also point that out as part of their ongoing clarification of this misleading ad. If an employee alleges that they have been dismissed for an unlawful reason, the onus remains on the employer to convince the court that the reason for the dismissal was in fact otherwise. That clarification should also be made. The reality is, as I said yesterday, that these ads are wrong, they are dishonest and they ought to be withdrawn.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. The reality is that all existing employees of the office of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are offered the option of an Australian workplace agreement, and those who decline such an offer stay on the certified agreement. At law, no existing employee of the department can be forced to take an Australian workplace agreement against their will. - The member for Perth this morning at his doorstop -  - The member for Perth asked the question. Does he want to hear the answer? - Do you want to hear the answer? - The member for Perth, in his doorstop this morning, made two inaccurate claims. He said, firstly, that staff of the department are being forced onto AWAs on inferior conditions and he said, secondly, if they do not sign AWAs, they will be sacked. I quote from the transcript:Individuals whose only choice will be if you don't sign, you'll be sacked.That is what he said. Both of those claims are inaccurate and false. Firstly, let us deal with the facts about the substance of what people are paid under these Australian workplace agreements, which they are clearly better off with. Within the department, the median salary level for all employees on AWAs at all levels above APS 4 is 3.4 per cent higher than that of those employees at the equivalent level who are on certified agreements. Here is proof within my department that those people who have taken up AWAs are being paid higher salaries than those on certified agreements. -  - They do not like to hear that because of their ideological objection to AWAs. If they really represented the workers of Australia, if they really represented the people who work in my department, they would be rejoicing at the fact that people are getting paid more. But they do not, and the reason they do not is because of their ideological objection. -  - On top of that, all staff on AWAs also have the ability to achieve a performance bonus of 20 per cent of the base salary. On the first claim, the member for Perth is clearly wrong. Secondly, nobody is sacked for refusing to take an Australian workplace agreement. I am advised that nobody in my department has been sacked. Currently, 53 per cent of employees in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are on Australian workplace agreements. By the rationale of the member for Perth, the other 47 per cent would be sacked. How ridiculous!</DOC>

I acknowledge that he is one of Australia's most famous mature age workers, and he is a great contributor to this House - I have a feeling that the very voluble member for Lalor will be sitting on that side of parliament watching the member for O'Connor in this House for a long time. - And long may she do so. The OECD released overnight its thematic report on older workers in the Australian economy, and it said this in its country note:Compared with many other OECD countries, Australia has been far from complacent in addressing the barriers to employment faced by older workers.It notes that in many areas Australia leads the world in what it has been doing in this area. It notes the fact that we recently made changes to the mature age allowance to eliminate disincentives for the participation of older workers. It notes the age discrimination legislation which we have introduced. It notes the opportunities for training older people in the TAFE system - and to that one could add the government's announcement of the mature age workers tax offset, which this government introduced as a policy at the last election.But having said all of those things, there are always more things that could be done. The government takes these recommendations seriously. For example, the OECD recommends incentives to remain in work longer and, of course, we have the pension bonus scheme which is directed towards doing that. The OECD says to reduce incentives to retire early and, of course, this is the government that announced the increase in the preservation age for superannuation to go to 60. We also have a program to lift the qualifying age for females for the aged pension to 65, the same as it is for males.In relation to this report, there are also recommendations - and I ask the opposition to listen to these - to improve the operation of Australia's disability support pension. The OECD says that disability benefits should be more closely tied to a substantial reduction in work capacity and recommends that we do away with the 30-hour a week test for disabilities. That is what we announced in this year's budget: to move from a 30-hour work test to a 15-hour work test for disability. The OECD also recommended that we review assessment procedures for disability benefits and that we reinforce mutual obligation.If you take this report as a whole, it notes that Australia - with our Intergenerational report, with our Productivity Commission report, with our statement on retirement for older Australian workers - is leading the world. But that does not mean we can stop; we have more work to do. In particular, as we announced in the budget, there is more work to be done in relation to welfare reform and the disability support pension. The only thing I would say to this House is: these reforms could be put in place so much easier if we did not have a negative, carping opposition which just opposes all good economic reform. Economic reform is in the long-term interests of Australia. This government wants to do it, and the opposition should allow it to proceed.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. Let me go on and talk about debt servicing ratios, because this was a favourite point that used to be made by the Australian Labor Party. Their favourite point was that the critical indicator in relation to foreign debt was the debt servicing ratio. It was a point that was made by the then Minister for Finance on 30 August 1995. He said that the debt servicing ratio, which had been as high as 20 per cent in the late 1980s, had fallen then to 11.2 per cent. He said that, as a consequence, foreign debt was nothing to worry about. If it was nothing to worry about at 11.2 per cent, he would be even less concerned today, because the debt servicing ratio today is 9.7 per cent. -  - The point is this: it was not a problem at 11.2 per cent; it falls to 9.7 per cent and all of a sudden he wants to say it has become a huge problem. The second thing is that I recall him informing this House on 20 September 1995 that one of the things that was not a problem about foreign debt then was that over 60 per cent of it was held by the private sector - he said, 'Only 40 per cent.' - If he was not concerned that 60 per cent of foreign debt was held by the private sector, how would he be feeling today when 97 per cent of foreign debt is held by the private sector? Let me say that, on the opposition's own tests - (1) debt servicing ratio and (2) composition of debt between private and public sectors - on both indicators, Australia's position has improved; and on composition it has improved very substantially, with the government falling from 40 per cent to four per cent, one-tenth of the amount of 1995. Let us add up the tests which the opposition has set and let us judge the result against what it has said and let us acknowledge the improvements on both of those indicators since 1995.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House know that those on this side of the House, who are in what are now called the Liberal and National parties, have always been on the side of freedom and on the side of democracy. I look forward to engaging the Labor Party in that debate in the years ahead - and we are off to a good start, I think. - One of the places where we have supported freedom is in Iraq. We were delighted with the success of the elections of 30 January and the fact that so many Iraqis bravely went out to vote. We have seen the emergence of a new democratic government in Iraq, and that is something this government supports. We know that it is fundamental to the long-term future of Iraq that the Iraqis themselves are able to take control of their own security. That democracy needs to be reinforced by the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police themselves, and we are contributing to training them.We are seeing a very promising phenomenon - it is a phenomenon that we have seen historically in other parts of the world - of the spread of democracy through the Middle East. It was once said, for example, that democracy would not take root in Asia - and it has. It has been said in more recent times by commentators that democracy would not take root in the Middle East. It is important that it does, and the fact is that it is taking root in Iraq and most recently it has been taking root in Lebanon. The fourth round of elections in Lebanon were held on 19 June. The member for Canning - I do not think he is back yet - was an observer of those elections. His participation was a practical demonstration of Australian support for democracy in Lebanon. The results show that a majority in parliament will be formed from the ranks of the opposition - unlike in this country - which has won over 70 seats out of 128. As one voter said - and this is an important point; it is a nice quote -  - Yes, the Labor Party won in the Northern Territory. That is small compensation, but it is compensation. In the case of Lebanon though, one voter said, 'Without Syrian influence, my vote can make a difference.' This is an illustration of the point that, coming very much in the context of the overthrow of tyranny in Iraq, there has been a spread of democracy through the Middle East. For example, in Saudi Arabia there have been local government elections. In Kuwait, it is important that women, on 16 May, were given the right to vote and there is now a woman in the Kuwaiti government. Wherever you go, people want freedom; and wherever people want freedom, you will find that the Australian government -  - the Liberal and the National parties, in one way or another, will be supporting those people who support democracy.</DOC>

 - The allegation by the shadow minister that the federal government is proposing some new standard for country of origin labelling is completely wrong. The changes in the Food Standards Code are proposed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. It is an organisation where the Commonwealth of Australia has one vote, New Zealand has one vote and each of the Labor states and territories has one vote. So the proposal that is being put forward is, in fact, one being put forward by FSANZ. The Commonwealth government has already indicated that it does not support the proposal being put forward by that organisation. This government will be voting against it when it comes to the next meeting of the ministerial council. Perhaps if the honourable member wanted to make a constructive contribution, he might lobby the state Labor governments to take a similar approach so that this standard is not changed.Regarding my answer to the question yesterday, I acknowledge - and I was going to raise it at the end of question time - that my answer in relation to country of origin labelling could have, in one section of the answer, been more complete. It is a fact that imported food and vegetables, when they are packaged or, for that matter, in many instances when they are not packaged, are required to be labelled. They must be labelled that they are imported or labelled with the country of origin. I accept that my answer yesterday was not complete in that regard in one stage of the answer, and I apologise to the House for that. However, I would refer you to the completion of the answer to the question where I said:It is really a matter for consumers whether they want imported food, fruit and vegetables to come into this country. They are labelled. If they don't want them, don't buy them.That statement is completely accurate and I stand by it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I can inform the House that the benefits of the government's tax cuts are that every Australian income tax payer will get a tax cut on 1 July this year. There was only one side of Australian politics that supported tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer on 1 July this year. The bill implementing those tax cuts was, as expected, blocked in the Senate - in the dying days of a passing Senate. So the determination as to whether or not the tax cuts go ahead rests, as it was always going to do, on the schedules, which have now been tabled in this House for nine sitting days and have now been tabled in the Senate for five sitting days. As the days count down, we have still not had an announcement from the Australian Labor Party as to whether or not it will move to disallow those schedules. Two weeks ago the Australian Labor Party determined not to determine a position, and determinedly it is sticking to its determination not to determine a position even today. That indicates, as we have always said, that the rest was a ruse. The Australian Labor Party decided to try to block tax cuts, and the Australian public knew it.It is a little unfair to blame just the Leader of the Opposition for this, because, as we all know, this decision was taken by the member for Lilley, the member for Swan and Senator Conroy. The three roosters were in the lockup, and they collectively made that decision. I read in the Age today that there is a belief among some caucus members that the influence of Wayne Swan and Stephen Smith is once again too strong on the Leader of the Opposition. This was a decision which came straight out of Roosters Central. They were all there in the fetid air of the lockup. They were all responsible, and members of Labor's backbench are quite right to be concerned about the influence that the roosters are now exercising over the egg.But there is a fox that circles this henhouse. Yond fox has a lean and hungry look as she licks her lips, because we also read in the Age today that concerns about federal Labor were raised in the shadow cabinet yesterday. Listen to this: according to the article, health spokesman Julia Gillard raised the concerns that the opposition was not developing policy, campaign themes and attacks on the government, and, 'with parliament rising this week for the winter break, there is worry this period might be wasted'.I think the member for Lalor is actually the spokeswoman who briefs out of caucus meetings, generally, but she did not get the briefing job today. The Leader of the Opposition decided to go out and do his press conference today to announce his campaign themes and to try and get his name up. But we would say that that fox circling the roosters has a hungry look because she knows, as the backbench knows, that the roosters bear a heavy responsibility. I say to the Labor Party: do not blame the member for Brand for all of your troubles; please spare a thought for the member for Lilley over the break.</DOC>

But let me tell the House that, as far as any cost is concerned, what small business wants to see is the end of go-away money for unfair dismissals. And this government will provide, under its new workplace relations system, a flexible workplace which enables small business to increase its productivity and to increase its wage rates for its employees. -  - Mr Speaker, those members of the opposition can interject and call out as much as they like -  - but it is only this government that stands up for small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for a lifetime of commitment to education, schools in particular. There are a number of facts in relation to school funding in Australia. The first is that state governments are responsible for, own, administer and primarily fund state schools. The Australian government makes a minority contribution to state government school funding, but it is nonetheless a significant and important one.It is that time of year when naturally we analyse and have the opportunity to see how the states are going in relation to the funding of their state government schools. The Howard government this year has increased funding to state government schools by eight per cent. So there has been an eight per cent increase in state government school funding from the Howard government in this year's budget. I can inform the House that throughout the country the state and territory governments have increased their funding to their schools not by eight per cent, not by seven, not by six, not by five and not by four - in fact, the states and territories have on average increased funding to state schools by 3.9 per cent.Honourable members would be aware that at this time of the year -  -  - we publish the 'missing millions' table. The 'missing millions' table, as members know, provides us with the opportunity to compare the funding of the Howard government for state schools with that of the states and territories. The member for Macquarie probably thinks that the state of New South Wales is the worst-performing state in the country for funding state schools. The Treasurer agrees with that? - You could be forgiven for thinking that that is the case, Mr Speaker. The New South Wales government increased funding to its schools, not by the 7.8 per cent increase of this government but by 4.3 per cent. Had it increased funding to the extent that the Howard government did, another $241 million would have been available for state schools in New South Wales this year alone. In fact, right across the country, if the states and territories had kept up with the Commonwealth, $882 million more would have been available for state schools in this country in this single year.But it is my melancholy duty to inform you that the worst-performing state in the country - and I am looking at the member for Adelaide and the member for Hindmarsh as I say this - is the state of South Australia. The Howard government has increased funding to state schools in South Australia by 7.3 per cent. The South Australian government has cut funding to state schools by almost half of one per cent - in other words, $133 million is not available for South Australian public schools this year, because the South Australian government is not keeping up with the Commonwealth. What would that do in terms of getting a performing arts school for Salisbury High School, as the member for Wakefield knows, or upgrading the Salisbury East High School, as the member for Makin knows? The fact is that the Labor Party has as much credibility on state school funding as it has on tax - so do not come here to Canberra driving a social justice truck, trying to lecture this government about funding for state schools. - I do not object.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. Aged care in this country has been transformed under the Howard government from the days of disinterest and apathy under Labor. Nowhere has that transformation been more evident than in rural and regional communities, where under the Howard government's reforms we now see more places and better care, better homes, better management and greater skill levels in the aged care work force.In relation to the allocation of places, for example, the Howard government will have allocated over 95,200 aged care places, community and residential care, in the period from 1996 to 2007. Currently, one-third of all aged care places are located in rural and regional communities. Last year in the 2004 aged care allocation around 40 per cent of places were allocated to rural and regional Australia. This year a further 11,000 places will be available, and 50 per cent of them will be available in rural and regional areas. We expect that level to continue for the next two years.Under the Aged Care Act, introduced by this government, rural and remote communities are deemed to be special needs communities. That is why, in the advertisement for the allocation of places that will be in this weekend's paper, there will also be information on applications for capital grants for rural and regional communities; that is why we have increased the viability supplement for rural and remote homes by $14½ million over four years; and that is why respite in rural and regional areas has also been a focus.In recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of rural and regional communities in electorates in Central Queensland, the Hunter Valley and the Riverina, as well as in the electorate of Richmond. I have been impressed by the enthusiasm that the local communities have for aged care and the enthusiasm with which they have embraced the government's reforms, working in partnership with this government to ensure high-quality, affordable and accessible care for older Australians in rural and regional Australia. In the meantime, the Labor opposition continues to wallow in apathy and disinterest. The Labor opposition still has no aged care policy.</DOC>

 - I am the minister for superannuation and I am happy to take the question. This question goes to a legislative matter raised in 2000-01 that was agreed to by both sides of the House - that is, people who are not licensed to provide financial advice shall not do so. This is not a new piece of legislation. Can I put to bed the rumour and the innuendo and the fear campaign of the Labor Party in regard to what is required of the small business community. If an employee goes to a small business person -  - I am endeavouring to explain to the opposition, as we did during the debate on the legislation, what is required here. When an employee goes and asks an employer for information to assist them, the employer is well within their rights to provide them with the government's help book on superannuation choice or direct them to the web site. What they cannot do is offer specific advice on a particular product.In the event that an employer inadvertently does the wrong thing, let us understand what is required here. First and foremost, ASIC would be required to receive a complaint. If they have received a complaint, they are obliged to do a criminal investigation. If there was criminal intent, they would then refer that to the DPP. The DPP then would determine whether or not there were charges to be laid. The scare campaign being waged by the Labor Party is just that; it is a last-ditch attempt to dent the opportunity of Australians to have choice of their own superannuation, and it is a disgrace.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Hughes for her question. I know how much she supports both our Medicare system and our strong private health system. The member for Hughes, like other members of the Howard government, understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system unless it is backed up and supported by a strong private health insurance system. Under the policies of the former Labor government, private health coverage was at 30 per cent and falling but, under the policies of the Howard government, private health coverage is 43 per cent and stable. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, nearly nine million people now have private health coverage, including more than one million people with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Almost three million people have taken up private health insurance since 1997, in large measure because of the private health insurance rebate that this government put in place and which saves the average Australian family with private health cover nearly $1,000 a year.If members opposite had their way, they would rip the guts out of private health insurance. They would immediately abolish the private health insurance rebate. The member for Brand, the current Leader of the Opposition, described the private health insurance rebate as an 'exceptionally bad piece of public policy'. He even called it a boondoggle in the days when he wore simplicity as a talisman. The member for Perth described the rebate that was put in place by this government as a public policy crime. The member for Melbourne, who is just waiting to come down onto the front bench, said it was one of the least efficient government programs of all time. The boss of the AWU, Bill Shorten, who sees himself as the next Leader of the Opposition, has called the rebate a subsidy for the rich.We know there is a dangerous sense of drift in the shadow cabinet. We know this because Michelle Gratton has reported the views of the member for Lalor. This is what happens when you ignore the member for Lalor's requests for questions in this parliament. That is what happens when you humiliate the member for Lalor by letting her say on Sky News, 'We are going to ask questions on it this week,' and then you stamp on her. You cannot humiliate the member for Lalor without in turn being humiliated yourself. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to dispel the sense of drift, he can say exactly where he stands now on the private health insurance rebate. When it comes to Medicare, this House and the whole country knows that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. The whole country knows that. When it comes to private health insurance, the Howard government is the only friend that private health insurance ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased that he shows so much interest in this issue. The International Whaling Commission meeting began yesterday in Ulsan, which is in South Korea. Senator Ian Campbell is strongly representing Australia at this meeting, as is Australia's International Whaling Commissioner. Senior officials from his department and my department are participating.At the initial stage, I am pleased to inform the House that Australia, with like-minded friends, was successful in voting down several measures proposed by Japan and other pro-whaling nations. We defeated Japan's attempt to remove conservation related items from the International Whaling Commission agenda by 31 votes to 24. We also defeated Japan's attempts to broaden the use of secret ballots in the IWC by 30 votes to 27. That is a good thing, at least for the purposes of this exercise. Australia has introduced a motion requesting that Japan's expanded scientific whaling program not be considered by the IWC until a review of their original scientific whaling program is completed. This motion will be voted on later this week. It has attracted 25 sponsors, which is promising. To be frank, this is not going to be an easy vote to win. Obviously Senator Campbell is making every effort on the ground there to make sure he is successful.I need to emphasise that the numbers on the IWC remain finely balanced. Delegations from several pro-whaling nations have not arrived yet, so we will have to just wait and see. We are obviously doing what we can to be successful in this meeting. We have a chance of being successful, but we do not want to overstate what we believe our chances are. It is going to be difficult. Two of the delegations that have not turned up are those of Nauru and India. I have written to the Nauruan foreign minister urging Nauru's support in this meeting. When I was in India the week before last, I met not only with External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh but also with Environment Minister Raja -  -  - Indeed, I did enjoy it. I took the opportunity to express to them Australia's strong opposition to commercial and scientific whaling, given that the meeting is coming up, and hoping that India would share not only our views but also our sentiments in the way it votes. We will continue to work with like-minded countries in the hope that we can prevail at this meeting.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Chief Opposition Whip's question, this was an election commitment which this government honoured. While I am here, let me correct the point: it was not for a toilet block; it was for lighting. This shows the opposition's level of concern for any advance of tourism in regional areas. Just as the constituents of my electorate of McEwen benefited, so too did the constituents of the member for Lyons, who received $850,000 of an election commitment in exactly the same way. Forty-eight cents out of every tourism dollar is spent in regional areas. This government supports tourism in regional areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise his interest in both these issues, in terms of opening up world markets not just for Australian exporters but for the developing countries of the world to help generate more economic activity in their countries. Developed nations like Australia have a responsibility in that regard. Our government firmly believes that free trade is the single most effective tool for lifting people out of poverty, particularly in the developing world. We have backed this belief with action. We have opened our market to the 49 least developed countries in the world so that they can get tariff-free access for their exports into the Australian economy.As the Prime Minister said last week, much of the solution for the undeveloped world lies in a major reduction in agriculture trade barriers. It is one thing to provide debt forgiveness and to provide aid, but those issues will not work by themselves. We need to see trade liberalisation and the opening up of the markets of major wealthy countries of the world to the developing world. It is time the major subsidisers, like the United States and the European Union, who spend over $US20 billion annually on support for agriculture, stood up to the protectionist forces within their countries and opened up their markets.They should follow the lead that is being taken and the example that is being set by British Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. With the support of some northern European nations, he has refused to endorse the European Commission's budget - a budget which proposed to spend 40 per cent of their revenue on agricultural support, which would support five per cent of the European population, who produce less than two per cent of the EU's total output. We should support the stand taken by British Prime Minister Tony Blair in this regard. This type of agriculture protectionism must end. The leadership shown by Mr Blair is to be applauded. Again, it highlights his ability to show leadership on tough political issues. He did the same on the question of Iraq in recent years. He did the same when he was confronted with calls to roll back the Thatcher reforms on industrial relations. He resisted those calls. Mr Blair is a quality Labour leader who can show clear leadership when confronted with difficult issues. I would suggest that, as we go into the winter break and as the Labor Party drift into the winter break, the Leader of the Opposition could take a leaf out of his friend's book - the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair - and show some leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney. He is right to be concerned about reports that anyone would want to be increasing taxation on Australians' retirement incomes. Yesterday the OECD released a report, Ageing and employment policies: Australia, and in that it recommended that taxes on superannuation could be increased to discourage older people from leaving the work force. Specifically, it said 'at least subject to less generous taxation rules'. I can understand it making that comment, because I can make allowances for the OECD being unaware that I announced in April of this year, of course, the Howard government's transition to retirement policy, which will allow workers to remain connected with the work force and to start to get access to their superannuation. What we cannot make allowances for is those who sit opposite who want to increase taxes on superannuation.It is a shame. It is an unmitigated mistake by the Labor Party to want to enforce upon the Australian public the retention of the super surcharge, at a cost of $2.5 billion over the next four years. Furthermore, they want not only to do that but also effectively to add another $4 billion in taxes by getting rid of the super co-contribution. This is something that Australians now have less than 10 days of this financial year to take advantage of. In other words, under the Howard government any worker earning under $58,000 in this financial year can put $1 into their superannuation, get $1.50 added on to it and make a big plus for their own retirement income. I am sure the member for Tangney will be telling his constituents about that and reminding them at the same time that it was only this week and last week that the Labor Party voted again to impose the super surcharge on Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition was aware that the reason petrol prices are so painfully high at the moment - and they are painfully high; the government understands that - is that the world price of crude oil has risen. It is as simple as that. - It is a record high, as the Treasurer reminds me. Let me say that since 1979, when I think the former leader of the Labor Party and former Labor Prime Minister and my immediate predecessor embraced the policy of import parity pricing for crude oil, I have not heard the Labor Party repudiate that policy. All I can say is that the call by the Leader of the Opposition for another inquiry is the sort of empty populism about which Senator Robert Ray has complained. To Senator Robert Ray, the member for Lalor and all the other people who are running around telling the Leader of the Opposition to lift his game can I say that a decent policy alternative and not cheap populism is what is needed from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The International Whaling Commission held its second day of meetings in Ulsan, Korea, yesterday. At that meeting Japan proposed an amendment to the convention that would have allowed the resumption of commercial whaling. I am pleased to inform the House, and of course it has been in the media in any case, that working closely with quite a number of like-minded countries we were successful in voting down this measure by 29 votes to 23. The fact that a majority - a good majority in the circumstances - were opposed to the resumption of commercial whaling is something that we particularly welcome. This was a vote that built on our earlier success in blocking Japan's attempts to alter the procedures and the agenda of the International Whaling Commission to suit pro-whaling nations.I make the point that this excellent result was the product of patient diplomacy, and I congratulate Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, on the excellent job he has done. I think we are all very grateful to him for his hard and effective work and to the officials of his department and my department. This is an example of patient diplomacy that has spanned many years. This is not an issue that has cropped up in the last three months; this issue is ages old. We have had very effective but quiet cooperation with our partners.There will be further votes in coming days, including on an Australian motion that the International Whaling Commission not consider Japan's expanded scientific whaling program until a review of the original program has been completed. The outcome is hard to predict and, again, it will be very difficult to get a majority. It is possible that we could, but it is possible that we will not. But in the end we will do our best to try to achieve that outcome.In conclusion, some members and commentators have argued that we should abandon this process, that it does not amount to much, and, instead, we should just go to the International Court of Justice. The government have always said that we do not rule in or rule out any options. We obviously keep our options open, but we would need to consider any measure like that very carefully. That is the sort of measure that needs to be thought through. Bringing legal action in the International Court of Justice is a process that could take a decade or more, so we would not get very quick results there. Also, the doctrine of abuse of rights, which is the basis on which we would take action in the International Court of Justice, has not succeeded so far and so that is a case that would have to be argued. A third consideration is that, even if we were successful after a decade or so in the International Court of Justice, it would be open to Japan to circumvent the impact of the court's decision by simply withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission. It is better that Japan remain in the International Whaling Commission, where its whaling activities can be supervised and regulated. We would not want to overreact by dealing with this issue in such a way that it might be to the benefit of a decent headline one day but in fact be entirely counterproductive the next. That is the sort of issue that not just the government but the parliament needs to think through very carefully.</DOC>

 - I would be happy to answer it. I am glad they have the heavyweights in action now! I simply say that our policy on this is very well known.

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released information on sales of new motor vehicles for May. That showed that sales were down by 1.2 per cent on the previous month. One would not want to overstate this, because 2003 was a record year, 2004 was a record year and 2005 is in excess of 2004, but the fact that sales are increasing at a slower rate compared to 2004 does show that consumer demand may well be slowing a little, as I have indicated through other data.Also, the skilled vacancies index was released today, which showed that skilled vacancies fell by 0.5 per cent in the June quarter and are 3.2 per cent lower over the year. That is consistent with the budget forecast showing a moderating domestic demand and employment growth slowing to 1¾ per cent in 2005-06. That is slower than in previous years but it would be sufficient to maintain the unemployment rate at around 5 per cent, which is at a 29-year low.The partial data released today, I believe, is consistent with other data such as we have had from the housing sector, which indicates a slowing in consumption in the domestic economy. We have had very large price rises in relation to exports, and a rebalancing of growth from domestic to external sources would certainly be welcome. This moderation of consumption may well be consistent with households rebuilding their balance sheets. Again, that would be a welcome development for the economy.</DOC>

 - No, I cannot advise what date the government became aware of that. I understand that Senator Ellison has been answering questions in relation to this in the Senate. - I am interrupted by the sound effects man down there! I can inform the House that data was stolen in America from CardSystems Solutions through computer hacking in the United States. I am informed that any person involved in using credit data stolen from CardSystems within Australia to access funds, credit or other financial benefits will be subject to offences under the Criminal Code. I am also informed that the code of practice between the Australian banks provides that, where somebody has suffered a loss because of fraud by a third party, the banks will make good and individuals will not be responsible for any loss. I am also told that the banking industry is forming an information security customer response task force, led by the Australian Bankers Association, which will be in place by 1 July.As far as I am aware, those banks that became aware of this credit card fraud in the United States took immediate steps to replace the cards. I am not aware that there has been any loss by any Australian user of those cards, because the banks have made that good. I believe that Australian law enforcement authorities are cooperating with their American counterparts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform the House that the good news is that all Australian income tax payers will receive a tax cut in nine days time on 1 July. The legislation to enact those tax cuts, unfortunately, has been blocked in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party, but schedules, which take effect and can be relied upon, have not been disallowed by motion in either house. They have now been in this House for 11 days and in the Senate for six days. There is only one more day of sitting for anyone to move a disallowance motion. Provided that no-one moves a disallowance motion tomorrow, those schedules will go ahead and every Australian will receive a tax cut on 1 July 2005.Labor's campaign to stop taxes being cut on 1 July 2005 has failed. The good news is that the public recognises that Labor's campaign against income tax cuts was a misguided campaign. A large proportion of the Australian Labor Party also now recognise that the decision by their so-called brains trust to oppose the income tax cuts in the budget was misguided - and the poor Leader of the Opposition is living with that. But, as I constantly say to the House, do not hold him solely responsible; he was advised by the member for Lilley, the member for Swan and Senator Conroy - the three wise roosters.This morning the member for Lilley was asked about the tax schedules. I will read the question and the answer, because I think the question is a bit of a corker. The journalist that approached the member for Lilley asked this question - and I ask the House to listen to it: 'Wayne, are the roosters worried that Kim Beazley isn't coming through?' Answer: 'No, we're not worried at all.' The good news is that the roosters are not worried. The line from rooster central is that there is no need to panic. Everything is going according to plan. There is a cunning strategy and all will shortly be revealed. Let the backbench of the Labor Party know that this particular strategy is under control - under rooster control. Situation normal at rooster command.We on this side of the House believe that taxes should be cut because, if you can fund your services, if you can balance your budget and if you can reduce your debt, income taxes should be as low as possible for the Australian public. We have a plan to cut income tax rates at the lowest marginal rate and to increase thresholds at the top rate. After these schedules go through and after the legislation goes through in August, only three per cent of Australians will be bothered by the top marginal tax rate. That will put incentive back in the Australian taxation system and encourage growth and the continuation of a strong economy in this country.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the negotiations with the drivers and Comcar. Now that the member for Perth has alerted me to them, I will make some inquiries. But I remind the member for Perth and the House that through the use of agreements Australians have more jobs and higher wages because of the changes brought about by this government. The reality is that Australians have enjoyed a 14 per cent increase in real wages because of the industrial relations changes that this government put in place - things which the member for Perth, amongst other colleagues on the other side, said would bring about the end of industrial relations as we know it. What he said in 1996 was wrong; what he is saying now will also be wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that there is very clear evidence that the government's aviation policies are working. There is strong growth in both the domestic aviation sector and the international aviation market. The combined domestic and regional aviation industry is operating now at record high levels, with almost 38 million passengers carried during the year ended December 2004. That was an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year. At the same time, passenger traffic on Australian international flights has also grown very strongly.Over the 12 months to December 2004, we saw a record high of 1.93 million passengers internationally - an increase of nearly 10 per cent on December 2003. International activity reached a record high of 10,000 flights in December 2004, which was 16 per cent higher than December 2003 and 48.4 per cent higher than the low recorded in June 2003 when activity was negatively impacted by SARS.The figures are very buoyant and very encouraging. They come off the back of the sharp downturn of two or three years ago, which no-one could have foreseen; but, nonetheless, they are remarkable figures. It is worth bearing in mind - and we must never forget it - that the aviation industry operates in a very volatile climate. It is particularly susceptible to sudden shocks. Unfortunately, the international aviation industry is highly corrupted with many airlines enjoying not only natural geographic advantages over us - that is all strength to their right arm - but also the protection of government ownership and support, which we no longer supply and should no longer supply in Australia.I make the point that, while the airlines themselves have to do everything they can to be internationally competitive - and we encourage them in that - there is also a vital need for international reform. There are too many airlines internationally because there are too many governments that prevent sensible rationalisation - a point well made by Rod Eddington recently. He is a well-known and respected Australian who headed up BA for a long time. Unfortunately, our carriers still face unreasonable restrictions on access to other countries. For example, in my view there are still unrealistic and unfair limitations on our access to the important UK market.On the domestic front, it is worth making the point that there are those opposite who would still want to saddle the aviation industry in Australia with the cost of a white elephant - namely, a second airport in Sydney. - Nonsense. He wants a second airport but cannot justify it. I think it would, by demonstrable indicators, be a white elephant that would cost the aviation industry a lot of money. The fact is that total passenger numbers at Sydney airport have more than recovered, but the number of actual aircraft movements is significantly lower than it was back in 2000. -  - A lot of policy thought has gone into this by those opposite. You can tell that. They are all over the place. There is a certain sense of aircraft drift here, aviation drift. What has happened is that there has been a rapid move to having fewer aircraft carrying more people - more rapid than anyone might reasonably have foreseen. Indeed, it is worth making the point that the Sydney airport master plan, approved last year, indicated that the airport would be able to cope with Sydney's air traffic needs for at least 20 years. I think that is a very good outcome indeed. Accordingly, I say to the House that the government has formed the view that a second Sydney airport will not be needed in the foreseeable future and, consequently, the government has no plans to impose a white elephant on the aviation industry in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can indicate to him and the House that the government's workplace reforms will protect minimum wages, they will protect collective bargaining and, indeed, they will protect the right of individuals to join unions. It is against this background that we see this continuing misleading campaign from the unions and the ACTU. Just recently they have been joined by some ALP MPs - namely, the member for Canberra; Senator Lundy, the Labor senator for the ACT; and the member for Fraser - who have sent out a letter to residents in the ACT, including a copy of an ACTU brochure which contains a number of misleading and deceptive statements. It appears now that the ACTU's campaign has been extended to using the postal allowance of ALP members to send out this misleading union campaign material.Like other misleading statements that have been made by the unions, this brochure contains further deceptive material. For example, this brochure asserts that minimum wages will be reduced. That is just wrong. It asserts that unions will not be able to access the workplace. Again, this is just wrong. It says the changes that the government proposes will reduce the capacity for collective bargaining. Again, that is simply wrong. So what we now have is ALP members being the mail-out boys and girls for the ACTU scare campaign. It would seem that, in return for the $47 million which the unions have donated to the Australian Labor Party, what they have bought for themselves is a junk mail delivery service, as this letter from the member for Canberra and the member for Fraser indicates.We have had an increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU as the days have gone on. Yesterday, the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, said that this government proposed to abolish federal awards. That is what he said - we would get rid of federal awards. That is absolutely wrong. It was made clear in the statement which the Prime Minister made to this parliament, it has been made clear in numerous other statements and it has been made clear in all the material which has been sent out that this government proposes to retain federal awards, yet we have this increasingly desperate campaign from the ACTU and Greg Combet, just saying things which are simply misleading and deceptive - a desperate campaign from a desperate union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As he knows, as members of this House know, and as the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers all recently agreed, Australia has a good health system. One of the reasons we have a good health system is that the Howard government does not just talk about Medicare; we invest the real money needed to make a good system better.I can say to the member for Hinkler that we have heeded his message about medical services in the bush. We have listened to people like the member for Hinkler and we are delivering. Under the policies of the Howard government, some 2,000 long-serving country doctors are receiving bonus payments of up to $25,000 a year to keep practising in country areas. We have put nurses into 1,100 rural practices and we have got 600 allied health professionals working with country GPs. There are now 11 rural clinical schools, including an excellent rural clinical school run by the University of Queensland in the town of Bundaberg in the electorate of Hinkler. There are 10 university departments of rural health. Twenty five per cent of medical students are required to do at least 50 per cent of their clinical training in country areas, because the more you train them in the bush the more likely they are to stay and practise in the country. Since 2001 there have been 346 additional medical student places at our universities, every single one of them bonded to country practice or practice in areas of work force shortage. Since 2000 there have been three new medical schools in the great state of Queensland, with 150-plus publicly funded places.Can I make it very clear to the member for Hinkler and everyone else in this House: Medicare matters. Medicare matters to the Howard government, and since the election I have answered 37 questions about Medicare from coalition members. I just had my fifth from the member for Lalor. I ask this question: what has the member for Lalor done to upset the Leader of the Opposition so much? What has she done? Let us face it: she is not the only one who leaks out of shadow cabinet. That is what you get from a bunch of dills: leaks out of shadow cabinet. Or it may be that the Leader of the Opposition has got the message that the member for Lalor has not got - that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I appreciate all the work she does and her interest in the way that our support for Indonesia and other countries in response to the tsunami is unfolding. This Sunday marks exactly six months since the tsunami tragedy, and it does provide an opportunity to outline both the timeliness and the effectiveness of the government's response. The government has now spent over $75 million on relief and rehabilitation assistance to help people rebuild their lives as a result of the tsunami. In Indonesia, over $40 million has been spent on projects in Aceh and North Sumatra. Over 1,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Aceh has been delivered, medical services are being assisted in their re-establishment, essential pharmaceutical supplies have been given, schools have been re-equipped and essential infrastructure, including water and sanitation, has been repaired. And we provided over 100 Australian medical staff to assist.As the emergency assistance phase draws to an end, as it obviously is - and we provided initially $60 million for that, all of which has been spent - and people return to their homes, we are beginning the task of assisting them to meet their longer term needs. In addition to what I have already described, the House well knows that the government has committed a billion dollars to the five-year Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development program, and progress on this is already pretty strong. Over $175 million worth of activities has already been agreed, including the $50 million Aceh rehabilitation program. We are helping, for example, with the rehabilitation of the Banda Aceh hospital; we are training doctors and nurses to take the places of some who were killed as a result of the tsunami.In conclusion, there has been some suggestion in one of the newspapers today, the Australian Financial Review, that this program was not unfolding. It is and it is unfolding at a good and effective pace. It would be folly indeed if we tried to spend all of the money at once. That does not just apply to the government but also to the non-government organisations which have raised over $300 million. They have spent about 20 per cent of that, but it needs to be spent over a period of time, not spent all at once. This program by both the government and the non-government organisations is progressing very successfully. I think all Australians will be pleased to hear that, because all Australians have supported the response by both the government and the non-government organisations to the tsunami.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. He is working hard to get those toilets fixed at the Tuggerawong Public School in his electorate. As I informed the House last week, the government, before handing over $33 billion of taxpayers' hard earned money for schooling over the next four years, has for the very first time put conditions on the funding. The states, before they receive that money, will be required to agree to a number of things, which include that by 2010 there will finally be a common starting age for schooling in Australia. We will from next year have not only testing of our children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in literacy and numeracy but reporting to parents. Principals will have a say over who actually teaches in the school. The performance of the school must be published at the school level. In other words, parents have a right to know how many students are passing literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7. They have a right to know the qualifications of the teachers, the participation of teachers in their ongoing professional learning and how much money governments spend on the support of teachers at the school level.One of the other requirements is career leaver destinations: how many kids got apprenticeships, how many went to TAFE, how many got a job and how many went to uni. That information needs to be published. Another requirement, which is long past due, is that of plain language reports to parents. As parents, we are sick and tired of getting politically correct language neutered reports at home about our kids. If you are told that your child is almost achieving, what does that mean? If you are told that your child is consolidating or performing sometimes or not yet performing, what does that mean? We have only one state government left to sign this agreement, and that is the Victorian government. The Victorian government has eight days to sign up before it will lose more than $1 billion in funding for schools.The plain English report cards will describe student performance as A, B, C, D or E. As parents, we know what A, B, C, D and E mean. They will also be required to tell parents which quartile, which 25 per cent, of the class their child falls in. So, taking the typical Australian primary school report which has gone to the states, for example looking at mathematics, the student will be graded A to E. So, for example, with a D in mathematics, Mr Speaker, you would know exactly what that meant if your child came home with that or was in the bottom 25 per cent. Then the teacher is required to explain in plain language what it means. So the grades are from A to E and then the parents must be told in which quartile of the class their child falls. If your child is in the bottom 25 per cent - somebody has to be there - you would want to know about it. For example, the report might say: 'Wayne is trying hard in maths and attempting his homework. However, he is not doing as well as last year and I would like to discuss further work he could do at home. Please contact me.' This is what parents are going to get over the next 12 months. Plain language reporting is a condition of funding, and I table an example of a plain language report.</DOC>

 - I make two points. First of all, I say to the member for Holt that any patient whose doctor believes that a particular drug is clinically necessary can, by way of an approach to the HIC and an authorisation from the HIC, ensure that that patient gets the drug at the standard copayment. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that we the government stand by our policy of a 12½ per cent mandatory price cut for new generic drugs coming onto the PBS. This is a good policy. - It is a good policy. - It is a good policy because we need to make more use of generic drugs and we need to deliver a better deal for the taxpayers of Australia. This is a government which is quite prepared to consider two objectives at once and which is quite capable of it. We are quite capable of both delivering the necessary drugs to the patients of Australia and protecting the interests of taxpayers - unlike members opposite, who are capable of nothing but irresponsible scaremongering.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. He represents some of the worst drought affected farmers in New South Wales and he has been a strong advocate, providing timely and effective assistance to the farmers in his region. The member for Hume will welcome the good news that yesterday the Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005 passed through the Senate. That means that all of the elements of the government's enhanced drought assistance package can now be implemented on time and in full. The legislation means that there will now be a $10,000 concession on off-farm income in assessing the eligibility of farmers in drought stricken areas for the exceptional circumstances relief payment. That will mean that a lot more farmers will be eligible to receive this essential help for them and their families.Other parts of the package include the more generous EC interest rate subsidies - up to 80 per cent in second and subsequent years of a drought - and the easier off-farm assets test associated with those benefits. Additional counselling and support services are being put in place. The new drought Envirofund round will be called very soon. And yesterday the Prime Minister and I were happy to ceremonially hand over a cheque for $3 million to the CWA so that they are able to commence their role in providing additional assistance to farmers and their families who are especially in need. Last week I provided to the state rural adjustment authorities revised guidelines for the implementation of the interest rate subsidies, which again will mean that more assistance will be available and that it will be provided under more generous terms than has been the case in the past.These benefits will certainly be encouraging to farmers facing the difficulties of drought. There is no doubt at all that the Howard-Anderson government has been the best friend that drought affected farmers have ever had. I guess there is only one thing better that we could deliver, and that is rain right across the nation. We have made a reasonable start on that, although I know we had a bit of assistance from above. There is one thing better than drought assistance that farmers can get, and that of course is rain across the country. I am encouraged by recent falls but, as the honourable member for Hume knows, there is going to have to be a continuation of this improved weather for some time before the drought is broken. In the interim, this government will stand beside farmers so that they are able to take advantage of better circumstances when they come.</DOC>

 - Let me make two points in response to the member for Lalor. The first point I make is that once upon a time there were responsible members of the Labor Party. Let me quote:... the community as a whole can ill-afford the situation where large quantities of these medicines are dispensed on medical prescriptions when they are readily available over the counter ...That is a very true statement - not from me, not from the Treasurer or the Prime Minister; it was from Dr Neal Blewett, the Labor minister for health, when the former Labor government took a large number of over-the-counter medicines off the PBS. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that the government has recently received advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on this matter, and we are taking it seriously.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and his interest in superannuation and the workers of Australia. On 1 July this year, in just nine days time, some five million Australian workers, for the very first time, will get the choice of determining where their investment, their superannuation, is to be invested. This is something that the coalition has been fighting for since 25 May 1995, when it was first announced as coalition policy. In November that year, the then shadow Treasurer, now the Treasurer, told the ASFA conference exactly what the coalition intended to do with choice and how we were going to empower Australian workers. We took it to the Australian public in 1996 and won an overwhelming mandate. Here we are, nine years later, with nine days to go before finally Australian workers will be able to choose where their money is invested. It certainly has been a marathon.To people listening, to the Australian workers out there, it must seem incredible to believe that the Labor Party is still seeking to obstruct the introduction of super choice. There is just one sitting day left in the Senate and the Labor Party is yet to support the government in passing the final superannuation choice legislation. That is creating confusion for small business and unnecessary uncertainty just because the Labor Party refuses to make a decision.People need to understand what it is that we are trying to achieve. For nine years the coalition have been fighting to give workers the right to be able to choose where their money is invested - not so some union through a union backed award agreement decides where your money goes, not so an employer decides where you should put your money, but so you as the worker who has earned that money decides where it goes. If an employee moves jobs they are required to set up another fund in many cases and have another set of fees. The Labor Party seems to think that is all right in 2005. That is the status quo that the Labor Party wants to maintain. - I hear the member for Jagajaga interject. In the same way, the member for Watson yesterday tried to tell the House that employers would face jail terms. I would like to tell the member for Brand, who is a Western Australian member - it may come as some surprise to him - that Western Australian employees have had the right to choose where they put their superannuation investments since 1998. I did not see at the last state election the Labor Party in Western Australia trying to remove that right. In fact, the very charge that was levelled in this place yesterday was that employers would go to jail. How many people have gone to jail? How many people have ASIC thrown the book at in Western Australia, where they have had the right of choice since 1998? One hundred? Ten? Zero. It is another lousy scare campaign and last-ditch attempt by the Labor Party to try to roll back choice. It is not going to happen.I read in the Financial Review today that the Labor Party will release its own super plan closer to the next federal election in 2007. I implore the Labor Party to make a decision today - not in 2007, not 12 years after we put choice into this place, but today - and once and for all support super choice in the Senate. Let Australian workers have the choice to determine where their biggest investment for their retirement - their superannuation - should be.</DOC>

 - The reasons for the government's proposed changes were initially outlined by me when I made a statement to the House and they will be the subject of further argument over the weeks and months ahead. Let me simply say to the honourable gentleman that these reforms are in the national interest and they will be proceeded with.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. Let me say just how much I appreciate the excellent job he has done recently as an observer of the Lebanon elections. He has been a very able representative of Australia and of this parliament. I made the point a couple of days ago, in answer to another question, that we on this side of the House stand up for freedom and democracy. That is a very important principle for us. Let me make this point: what we are doing in Iraq is helping the Iraqi people consolidate the opportunity they now have to build a democratic Iraq. A democratic Iraq will be part of the solution to an expanding democratic process in the Middle East. In order to achieve this, the Iraqis will eventually have to take control of their own security forces. There is no question about that and there is no argument about that. To do that, they have to be trained. Two Australian army training teams have trained the 4th and 8th Brigades of the Iraqi 3rd Division. A third team is currently providing logistics training. The Royal Australian Navy, the Al Muthanna Task Group and the Australian Federal Police are also involved in training. Captain Randy Green said the other day:The whole point of this is when those guys get trained up, we can all go home.Who is Randy Green? He is a captain in the Louisiana 256th 'Tiger' Brigade who was 'transition training' - as they call it - the Iraqis who freed Douglas Wood. Douglas Wood said:... I am proof positive that the current policy of training the Iraqi Army ... worked because it was the Iraqis that got me out.The international community broadly recognises this and is prepared to support it. Is there an alternative? The opposition in this country has tried to walk away, in recent months, from the issue of Iraq. There was, I admit, an agreed cessation of hostilities through the Douglas Wood period but other than that the opposition has been embarrassed by one key development in Iraq - and that was the election on 30 January. Since the election on 30 January in Iraq, the opposition's position - which, you might recall, had been that we should not have taken action to get rid of Saddam Hussein - has been that we should not be training the Iraqi forces and that we should not be contributing to helping the Iraqis seize control of their own security environment. That is a muddle-headed and a wrong policy. It was all summed up this week by the member for Griffith - the expert on everything - who said, in response to Douglas Wood's point about the importance of training the Iraqi army:I don't think Douglas Wood would set himself up as an on-the-ground national security policy expert ...Douglas Wood does not know as much about security issues in Iraq as the member for Griffith! That says it all. It simply proves that the opposition has no credibility at all on these issues.</DOC>

 - No, they do not, because some of the factors that were present some time ago when I spoke critically of levels of foreign debt are not now present. Firstly, when I spoke critically of foreign debt when Labor was in office the budget was in deep deficit; it is now in strong surplus. When I spoke critically the contribution being made by the government to the indebtedness of this country was immense; now it is negligible.The reality is that the net foreign debt servicing ratio - which is measured as net interest payments on debt as a proportion of exports - is currently at 9.7 per cent. Over the period from March 1983 to March 1996 - those on the other side will be very familiar with this period - the debt servicing ratio averaged 13.9 per cent. Since March 1996 the debt servicing ratio has averaged 9.7 per cent, and that, in anybody's language, represents a very sharp reduction. The Australian economy is now in a state which is vastly different from when this government came to office over nine years ago. The debt servicing ratio is lower, our capacity to handle external shocks is greater, our regard around the world is impressive and the economic fundamentals of this economy are rightly seen as amongst the strongest around the world. I finish my answer simply by quoting the statistic that the net general government debt in Australia is just 1.9 per cent of GDP, the OECD average is 46 per cent, for the United States it is 44 per cent, and the level for the Euro area is 53 per cent. I rest my case.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. The 2004-05 financial year is drawing to a close - it will end in a few days time - so we can look back over the last year and see where the economy has come from. At the end of this financial year, on 30 June 2005, more Australians will be in work than ever before in Australian history. There were 330,000 new jobs created over the last year, and two-thirds of them, or 227,000 jobs, were full time. There are more people participating in the work force than ever before, with the participation rate rising to a record high of 64.6 per cent. The unemployment rate remains at lows we have not seen for 29 years. Over the last year, inflation has averaged 2.4 per cent, which is within the government's two to three per cent band. When we close out the financial year, it will be the seventh budget surplus that this government has produced. When we close out the financial year, we will have reduced $80 billion of Labor Party debt, and we are forecasting to go even further next year.I can report to the House that businesses have invested heavily in the productive capacity of the economy, with investment rising 11.1 per cent over the last year and profits rising 8.3 per cent over the last year. Profitability, particularly in the resource sector, has driven the Australian share market to record highs which are not seen in any of the other share markets around the world. As we look forward to the next year, 2005-06, as I reported in the budget, we expect some rebalancing of growth out of domestic sources and into external sources. This will be good as part of the continuing growth of the Australian economy, one of the growth economies of the world. In addition to that, the government's reform program will underpin productivity improvements over the course of the next year. There is no more important reform than industrial relations reform. When this House reforms industrial relations, that will be the most important microeconomic reform that we have seen in this country for a very long time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question, and I can inform the House that the income tax cuts which were announced in this year's budget will be implemented, as promised, on 1 July and will cut tax for every Australian income taxpayer. This is the last day of sitting for both the House of Representatives and the Senate. No motion of disallowance of the income tax schedules has been moved, so the Labor Party's campaign to defeat income tax cuts has been defeated. It is regrettable, however, that the Labor Party has yet to announce its position on those schedules. The Labor Party still maintains determinedly that it is determined not to determine a position in respect of those income tax schedules. This old Senate will pass out without the Labor Party ever having actually announced a position.There has been a lot of finger-pointing going on in the Labor Party as to whose brilliant idea it was to decide to oppose the tax cuts. Most people were saying that it was the Leader of the Opposition; although, as I keep pointing out, it was a decision endorsed by 'Rooster Central', led by the member for Lilley. I say to members of the House that there is good news: the Leader of the Opposition did a press conference today and confirmed that the member for Lilley will not be moved in a reshuffle. I think he has the support of this side of the House absolutely for that decision. The member for Lilley was quoted in the Australian today, and when he was asked why the tactics on tax cuts were so bad he said, 'We didn't bugger up the tax argument.' That is a revelation to members on this side of the House. If the Labor Party was not against tax cuts, why did it not support them? Why did it not pass them? Why did it not announce that it would allow the schedules? Let me say again: the reality is that the Labor Party to this day believes that nobody should get a tax cut on 1 July. - The Labor Party believes that the tax cuts on 1 July should be absolutely nothing for every single Australian. - That is what they announced. That is what they moved. That is what they support. That is what they are in favour of. There is one side of this House that stands for lower income taxes and that is the coalition. It always has because we believe in getting government off the backs of people and giving them incentive to work.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question as it relates to protecting Australians from the threat of terrorism. The government's commitment to do everything it can to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism is a matter of record. Our response to the shocking attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 was swift, decisive and comprehensive. We have spent in the order of $4 billion boosting the capacity of security and law enforcement agencies. We have enhanced our coordination arrangements and we have tested arrangements frequently in counter-terrorism exercises. We have put in place a stronger national security legislative framework and a number of those measures have been further enhanced in legislation that has passed this House in the last few days.I can confirm today that ASIO has conducted a series of enter and search operations in Melbourne, in collaboration with Victorian police and the Australian Federal Police. Consistent with longstanding practice, details of those operations are not normally made public and I do not intend to infringe in relation to that. But I can say that the entry to premises was effected by state police and the Australian Federal Police, and that entry to the premises and the maintenance of the security cordon were conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures. I am confident that ASIO and the police have made every effort to ensure that those issues were dealt with in a proper manner and that consideration was given to the occupants concerned.Generally, I have found over a period of time that, while ASIO's activities are not the subject of publicity - other than a number of articles that occur from time to time, which are occasionally critical - from the briefings I receive and from the warrants that I play a part in issuing I have always found ASIO to be a most professional organisation that undertakes its activities in accordance with the law. It uses its powers judiciously and only under warrant, and law enforcement agencies that assist it do so to ensure that its functions - that is, the security agency's functions - can be properly exercised and not unreasonably hampered.Recent evidence before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, which deals with security issues and which is reviewing ASIO's questioning and detention powers, has highlighted the continued importance and relevance of those powers in the fight against terrorism in which we are engaged. I would like to place on record my support and that of the whole government, and I believe the support of the people and I am sure on behalf of the opposition as well, for our security and law enforcement agencies. We appreciate the vigilance with which they are undertaking their activities and the professional way in which they conduct their very important work.</DOC>

 - I did yesterday; I invite the House to look at the Hansard. I said that I became aware of it when it was reported in the newspaper and that Senator Ellison became aware of it when it was reported in the newspaper. - We are the ministers of the government. I could walk up and down the front bench and ask every single minister when they became aware. I believe the answer would be the same: when they read it in the newspaper. As it happens, I have also asked the Treasury when it became aware. The Treasury became aware when it read it in the newspaper. I believe that the member for Hunter owes an apology to the Treasury because he put out a press release yesterday suggesting that there had been a cover-up by the Treasury. The Treasury has now provided written advice: it was made aware when it read it in the newspaper. If you had any decency, you would apologise to the Treasury.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in the proceedings of the International Whaling Commission. Yesterday the commission held its third day of meetings in Korea. Anti-whaling nations, which have been led by Australia - and, by the way, particularly led by Senator Ian Campbell; I think that all members, if they were honest with themselves, would admit he has done an outstanding job - were successful in several votes. The Australian resolution urging Japan to withdraw its proposal for expanded scientific whaling, which I thought would be the hardest resolution to get adopted and had real doubts as to whether we could get it adopted, was adopted by 30 votes to 27. This is a tremendous result and it reflects the enormous amount of work that, quietly and behind the scenes, has been put into this issue by the Australian government.Following this vote, Japan withdrew its own resolution seeking support for its expanded scientific whaling program - and I am glad it withdrew it, because I am confident it would have been defeated. In another win, Australia and other anti-whaling nations successfully defeated by 30 votes to 25 the Japanese proposal to abolish the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. Japan is a country with which we have a very strong and friendly relationship in spite of this, but I think this does send a very strong message to our friends in Japan that the international community is solidly opposed to whaling and, in particular, to Japan increasing its scientific whaling quotas.In conclusion, let me make the point that, in spite of these differences with Japan over whaling, which are sharp differences, it is a strong relationship that we have with that country. For example, senior officials from Australia met with American and Japanese officials yesterday in London for a preliminary meeting of the trilateral security dialogue, in preparation for the ministerial meeting that will take place later this year, and we have also commenced study on a free trade agreement. I think this demonstrates that, even between the closest of friends like Australia and Japan, we can have disagreements, sometimes sharp disagreements, but in the context of those disagreements we have been able to prevail and prevail very successfully in the International Whaling Commission. I am sure that one day the history of how all of this has happened will be written. What will be revealed in that history is that the Australian government - quietly, behind the scenes, thoughtfully and sometimes painfully - made sure that we were able to win. That is the main thing - not political stunts, but victory.</DOC>

Japan is a great friend of Australia. Let us make no mistake about that.

 - I thank the member for Page for his question and his strong support of the government's comprehensive trade policy agenda in pursuing extra access into the many markets of the world. We have a specific focus on North Asia at the moment. Given the last question, it is important to note that we are putting a lot of effort, resources and energy into improving our trading relationships in North Asia and those massively growing markets. The traditional market is in Japan, but the fastest growing market and the fastest growing economy in the world is in China. A free trade agreement between Australia and China would undoubtedly create extra Australian jobs and raise living standards across the country.Our economic relationship with China, particularly expressed in two-way merchandise trade, has quadrupled over the last decade to stand at about $29 billion at the moment. China is one of our fastest growing services exports markets, particularly in the education and tourism areas. It is growing rapidly, along with the broader services sector, recognising in the last 12 months our services exports have grown quite considerably. A free trade agreement with China would encourage even greater trade and investment flows across all sectors of our economy, including agriculture, manufactures, minerals, energy as well as services.But, just as importantly, a successfully concluded FTA negotiation with China would provide us with the opportunity to shape our future economic and trade relationship with the fastest growing market in the world, China. It would give us a chance to protect and promote Australia's interests in that market against the competitive position of our competitors in the region. We should not lose sight of the fact that China is also negotiating these agreements with other countries in the region. In the last two years, China has accounted for a quarter of world growth and a similar share of growth in global trade. It is absolutely in the Australian national interest that we pursue this goal. Independent economic analysis has indicated quite clearly that there is significant economic benefit to be had for the Australian economy as a result of a successfully negotiated free trade agreement with China. As I indicated earlier, it is part of our comprehensive trade policy agenda that goes right across a number of bilateral negotiations and also, and most importantly, the crucial WTO negotiations of the Doha Round as it stands now.Of course, the shadow spokesman for trade is often reminding us that that should be the No. 1 trade priority. It is, and I continue to say to him that it is. In an effort to ensure that we maintain our energy levels not just on our bilateral agenda but also - importantly in this year of a WTO ministerial meeting - in the multilateral arena and the Doha Round, the government is going to allocate an extra $11 million worth of resources to all the departments that are closely engaged and involved in all these negotiations so we can take greatest advantage of not just the bilateral agenda but also the multilateral agenda in terms of the consultation process, developing our negotiating mandate here in Australia on behalf of Australia's exporting industries and our producers in Australia and prosecuting the case in developing a base of support in countries like China where we are negotiating.I am encouraged by his support for this, and I note that he said on radio recently that 'Australia has the potential to benefit in many areas, including the food sector, telecommunications sector and in the provision of education and health services as a result of a free trade agreement with China.' We welcome that support. There has been recent polling undertaken on behalf of Austrade that indicates that amongst the broader community there is a 60 per cent level of support for the government's position in negotiating a free trade agreement with China. So we welcome this support from the broader community and we welcome this support from the opposition spokesman on trade, because they all agree with the government that this policy pursuit is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - All countries are entitled to the right of self-defence under the United Nations Charter, and I actually think even Indonesia is entitled to a right of self-defence - all countries are. We are. The thing about this is that this is an argument about so-called pre-emption. The Labor Party says that it does not support pre-emption. What that actually means is that in certain circumstances the Labor Party does not believe we should take action to protect Australian citizens, and we would like to know what those circumstances are.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. Yesterday new guidelines came into effect which outlined new powers for the building industry task force which will assist this task force in the collection and gathering of information and in conducting investigations into intimidation, thuggery and unlawful conduct in the commercial building and construction industry in Australia. These measures arise from an act of parliament passed a year ago that has been blocked in the Senate for over 12 months by the Labor Party. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has opposed every single measure that the government has pursued to clean up coercion and intimidation in the building and construction industry.If it were not for the Democrats - in this case, their industrial relations spokesperson, Senator Murray - supporting the government, then we would not have got these laws in place to protect against coercion and intimidation. So in the very week when the Australian Labor Party are running advertisements about fictional intimidation in the workplace, they themselves have opposed measures in this parliament to stop intimidation and coercion in the industry where it frequently occurs. We have an advertisement running from the ALP about so-called coercion, and yet it seems that the ACTU, who is running this advertisement, has no qualms whatsoever about actual coercion and intimidation which is occurring in the building and construction area at the hands of the CFMEU.If we want some examples of this actual coercion then we have only to look at the evidence that was given to the Cole royal commission. I have a copy of the transcript of the Cole royal commission from 21 February 2002. In it, a representative of the CFMEU, the building construction union, is discussing how he forced subcontractors to sign union agreements. The commissioner asked this question: 'How did you achieve that?' Answer: 'No ticket, no start; if that didn't work, apply a bit of pressure.' And then further on in the transcript: 'Did you give them time to read the document before they signed it?' Answer: 'It didn't really matter, did it? No, I didn't.' There was no reading of the document whatsoever. 'And you're undertaking activities on behalf of the CFMEU?' 'That's correct.'This is a person who admits under questioning in the Cole royal commission that he was engaged in coercion, intimidation and thuggery - in unlawful activities - and yet when we bring before this parliament a bill and guidelines to try and stamp out that thuggery, intimidation and coercion, what do we get from the Australian Labor Party? Absolutely nothing. Have they been prepared to support us? Not a word of support whatsoever. Perhaps it has got a lot to do with the $4.9 million that the CFMEU has donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last nine years. They can run all the ads they like but the reality is that when it comes to doing something about coercion and intimidation, only this side of parliament has been prepared to do it.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I thank the honourable member for his question. I really appreciate the opportunity to talk in the House about the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and I think all honourable members will be pleased to hear something about it. The Prime Minister stated on 7 April the government's position. We have not signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. I might just remind the House that this was a matter that was given careful consideration by the Keating government. I think I am right in saying that my predecessor, Gareth Evans, went rushing along to Mr Keating's office and said, 'I'd love to sign this' and Mr Keating said, 'No way, mate' - or words to that effect. - The Prime Minister on 17 April or 7 April rather - I think it was 7 April; the honourable member said it was, I can double-check that but I recall the words - gave an articulation of the government's position. We have not supported this treaty for two or three reasons. First of all, in its preamble it talks about the Bandung principles. Australia has never been a supporter of the Bandung principles in the sense that we are not a member of the non-aligned movement - we never have been and under this government we will not be. The second thing is that it talks about non-interference in internal affairs and we have said, 'Well, we don't feel enthusiastic about signing up to something like that because we feel we have got the right sometimes to criticise other countries if we are unhappy with their practices.' Thirdly, it establishes a high council. This high council can only include a signatory like Australia - a non-ASEAN country - if a dispute relates to Australia itself, as I understand it. In other words, we would not be a full and constant member of the high council.Having said these things, there has not been a change in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation; but it has been made clear to us as a result of the foreign ministers' meeting at Cebu that one of the three conditions for Australia joining the East Asia Summit would be for us to sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. What the Prime Minister has been reflecting is what we have been reflecting on as a government: will we maintain the position that the Keating government had, and our government has had, that we would not sign this treaty because of the concerns that I think the House would have been interested to hear and that I have articulated? On the other hand, we will have to weigh that up against the benefits that Australia would be able to gain from being a member of the East Asia Summit and, if you like, being there at the birth of an East Asian community. The Prime Minister has made that point on more than one occasion. I do not have the dates, I do not have the quotes here, but we will weigh that up. I will reveal even more. I really thank you for this question because this is something that we are talking to our - </DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Kingston for his question. As he knows, and as all members of this House should know, Australia has a very good health system. The Prime Minister of this country and the state Labor premiers all agree that our health system is amongst the best in the world. This is so because we have a government which does not just talk about Medicare; it invests the money necessary to make a good system even better. We have not just spent the money; we have generated the results. I want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of a large number of staff of the Health Insurance Commission. For 30 years these good people have been serving our country through Medicare. I want to say that we could not to do it without them. The good public servants of this country are the unseen pillars of our democracy. I thank them, I congratulate them, and I know that they believe that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.There is the safety net - the biggest structural improvement since 1984. We are investing $1.1 billion in the safety net. We are helping 1.5 million people next year. There are the bulk-billing incentive payments, which have lifted the national GP bulk-billing rate from 66 per cent to 73 per cent. There is the private health insurance rebate which has brought an extra three million people into private health insurance. There are the chronic disease management items just going onto the medical benefit schedule, which should mean that GPs have the rebates necessary to give their patients with chronic disease the time and the effort that they deserve. There is the allied health professional measure which, for the first time, has brought professionals such a physiotherapists, psychologists, dieticians, OTs, chiropractors and osteopaths into the Medicare net.I pay tribute to retiring Senator Meg Lees for her work there and also to retiring Senator Len Harris, who is in the gallery today. May I say of Len Harris: the right man but the wrong party, mate. Thanks for your help on the allied health professional measure. There is the 30 per cent increase in medical student places since 2000 and there is the $830 million that we are investing in the rural health strategy. The Deputy Prime Minister may not regard the $830 million invested in the rural health strategy as necessarily his biggest achievement, but it is his indefatigable advocacy for country Australians which has put it there. That is one of the indicators that, long after he has left this government, the good work that he has done will continue. The Australian public are recognising the good work that the Howard government is doing in health and Medicare issues, as the latest Newspoll shows. What the public know, what the Leader of the Opposition knows, from the way he keeps his shadow minister for health advisedly under wraps, is that the Howard government is most definitely the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I am not sure what has happened to the tactics committee today, but the answer to your question is that at the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting at Cebu - I do not have the exact date but this was after the April statement by the Prime Minister - the ASEAN foreign ministers agreed to three criteria for participation in the East Asia Summit. Prior to that, there were no criteria for participation in the East Asia Summit. Of the three criteria, one of them was that participants in the East Asia Summit should sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. I do not see anything very political about this. Bearing that in mind and bearing in mind the great benefits that potentially Australia could yield from achieving something that would be very good for Australia, which is to be part of the emerging East Asian community and something that the Howard government has a real chance of achieving, we decided we would have discussions with ASEAN officials about this issue of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.I was about to say, until I was so rudely interrupted by the member for Griffith, that we are undertaking discussions right at the moment. Over the last few weeks a deputy secretary of my department has been talking directly with some of those officials and we have had other contacts with them through our embassies and high commissions in the region. If we can come up with a satisfactory solution, and I hope we can, I think we can achieve the perfect outcome for Australia, which would be to participate in the East Asia Summit without in any way undermining the importance of our existing treaty arrangements with countries outside of ASEAN. We will see what conclusion we reach here. I think we will reach a conclusion before the parliament resumes. I really appreciate the opportunity of answering two questions about this from the member for Griffith and the member for Swan. I thank you for your interest and I am available for further questions if you would like.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question. He is a very strong advocate for Murdoch University. It was reported yesterday that three Western Australian universities, Edith Cowan, Murdoch and Curtin universities were engaged in dialogue with a view to a possible merger. It is important for us to understand that, as a country of 20 million people, we currently have 38 publicly funded universities and about 100 private universities in Australia. In order for us to offer high-quality, accessible education to increasing numbers of Australians, it requires increased money and the government has committed an additional $11 billion in public funding to universities over the next 10 years. I too congratulate Senator Len Harris for joining with the government benches in supporting these reforms.Yesterday the vice-chancellor of Curtin University, Professor Twomey, in referring to this proposed amalgamation, said:Students at Murdoch and Curtin would have more choice because having more students would allow less viable courses and programs to run. - I advise the House and the member for Tangney that the government, as part of the reforms, has not only provided an additional 39,000 HECS or government funded places but also provided $145 million in performance funding specifically available for management reform -  - course rationalisation, amalgamations and structural reform in the university sector. For example, it is well known -  - that when, on behalf of the government, 3½ years ago I started on the course of reform in Australian universities the then Northern Territory University offered 167 courses and 97 of the courses had fewer than five students enrolled in them. There were 20,600 units on offer in universities with fewer than five students enrolled and more than 4,000 with less than one student. The University of Newcastle, which is undergoing serious economic reform, has for the last three years offered 148 subjects that have not had a single student enrolled.In the past I have also advised the House that the member for Leichhardt left school at 14 to clean toilets at the Mareeba train station to pay for the law degree for the member for Hotham. When he leaves the parliament, he is thinking about doing a university degree, and he has a lot to choose from. For example, he can do Paranormal at Griffith University. If he wants to, he can enrol in Scepticism at Griffith University. He can do Golf Course Management. He can do Surfboard Riding at Edith Cowan or Southern Cross. He can do Aromatherapy. But he tells me he is particularly interested in Make-up Application for Drag Queens at Swinburne.The reality is that the average, everyday taxpayer expects the government to ensure that money invested in universities is invested efficiently and that there is reasonable management and structural reform. The future of higher education will look increasingly to these kinds of amalgamations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She has always been a very strong advocate for her electorate and for local government. This financial year the Australian government will provide more than $2 billion to local government. That includes $1.617 million in financial assistance grants and some $336.1 million in the Roads to Recovery program, a program that has been very well received by local government.Cost shifting is a great concern to the federal government. It is a great concern to the Australian Local Government Association, which estimates that somewhere in the range of $500 million to $1.1 billion annually is shifted onto local government, predominantly from the state governments. The government took a leadership role and asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration to look into cost shifting. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you have an interest in this, and you ably chaired that inquiry.Yesterday, the government tabled its response to the Hawker report. The main elements of our response were that we will pursue an intergovernmental agreement aimed at improving local government relations, introduce a motion in both chambers of the parliament recognising local government as an integral level of governance in Australia, and ask the Commonwealth Grants Commission to review the interstate split for the identified local roads component of the financial assistance grants and report back to the government by June 2006. We will maintain the financial assistance grants for four years for councils that amalgamate. We will also ask the Productivity Commission to initiate a study into local government's revenue-raising capacity.In conclusion, the government's response to the Hawker report demonstrates our commitment to deriving outcomes from inquiries, the very strong commitment to local government and the commitment to ensure that funds for local government stay with local government and result in infrastructure and services at the local level. I would like to thank the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Paul Bell, and the members of that association for their constructive input and support for the government's response to a very important inquiry.</DOC>

 - Can I say very directly in relation to the last part of the question that these changes are not extreme; they are the sensible next step along the path to securing more productivity for the future wage and salary earners of Australia. So far as the particulars of the IR Commission decision are concerned, we are examining them and, as the minister has indicated, our position will be reflected when the legislation is brought down.Could I say a couple of things about the changes before the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him get too carried away with the nature of the commission's decision. The commission's decision was notable for the fact that it gave people a right to ask for something. I would have thought it was a very odd industrial relations system that had to give people the right to ask for something. In a true flexible system, you ask for it; you are not conferred a right by some third party to do so - you just ask for it.The best way that I could categorise the decision of the IRC is that it represented a recognition that when it was all boiled down the question of whether people could properly enjoy such additional rights depended very much on an agreement to be concluded at the enterprise. That has been really the essence of the reforms that we have argued for. The reforms that we have argued for will provide greater flexibility.The Leader of the Opposition seeks guarantees. I tell you what I will guarantee: I will guarantee that under our reforms real wages will continue to grow and that under our reforms unemployment will continue to fall. I will further guarantee that if you embrace the approach of the Leader of the Opposition the economic progress of the last 15 years will stall.</DOC>

 - I have seen claims, and they have come from the Leader of the Opposition and also from some of the spokesmen that sit behind him. The thrust of these claims basically is that over the last four years, since 11 September 2001, the government has not done enough to look to the national security of this country and by definition that if the Leader of the Opposition had been in charge of things everything would be better and we would all be a lot safer. He talks about 'yawning gaps' in our aviation security and he talks about us behaving as though we believed the threat was not real and should not be addressed.Let me remind the House of what the government has done and let me remind the House of what the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, stopped us doing for two years. Let me remind the House that since September 11 the government has committed about $5.6 billion for robust and comprehensive national security measures. They include significantly increased resources for intelligence agencies, specialist police counter-terrorism units, new laws dealing with terrorism, enhanced Australian Defence Force tactical response capability, tighter aviation and maritime security, initiatives to protect critical infrastructure, and counter-terrorism building in our own region.But even more relevant to the criticisms that the Leader of the Opposition has made, can I remind the Leader of the Opposition of something, particularly in light of his statement on 25 July 2005:_ it is the Opposition which has taken a wholly positive and constructive approach to whenever the Government has put up legislation enhancing the powers of ASIO and putting in place terrorist legislation.But let us look at the record. The government introduced a suite of legislation in parliament in July 2002, and it took almost two years before the opposition agreed to pass that legislation. For two years we were struggling to get the support of the Labor Party in the Senate to enact a necessary enhancement of ASIO's powers. The Leader of the Opposition, in contrast -  - He says, 'Rubbish,' Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition in fact voted in favour of delaying the legislation. What the government wanted to do was to give the Attorney-General the right to proscribe organisations. What was the weak response of the Labor Party? The weak response of the Labor Party was to say that the only organisations you could proscribe were those organisations proscribed by the United Nations Security Council. They said, 'We will guard our security according to assessments of the United Nations Security Council.' The opposition's 'positive and constructive approach' saw that legislation amended in the Senate to remove the government's power to list organisations like Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad group and Lashkar-e-Taiba. -  - You can interject as much as you like; it was the Labor Party that blocked our attempt to strengthen the powers of ASIO. Now the Leader of the Opposition has got the nerve to stand up in this place and say, 'The government have gone to sleep at the wheel.' You were trying to stop the wheel turning - that is what the Leader of the Opposition was doing.Do you know the irony of all this, Mr Speaker? The person who actually removed the road block was indeed the former but not very lamented member for Werriwa when he became the Leader of the Opposition and he and the member for Barton got together. The member for Barton knows that what I am saying is correct. They got together and they decided that this obstruction should end in the national interest. But for two years, with the support and the endorsement of the member for Brand, under the leadership of the member for Hotham, the Australian Labor Party blocked our attempts. So let us have no more of this opposition humbug that the government have gone to sleep on terrorism; it was the opposition that delayed legitimate attempts to strengthen the powers of ASIO, and the Australian people will not forget it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The incident referred to by the honourable member has been canvassed significantly in the media, so of course his statement today comes as no surprise. The reality is that a member of the public did, on or about the date the honourable member has spoken about, cut through the fence on the perimeter of the Sydney airport. He was observed by the closed-circuit television system at the time, so his attempt to enter the airport was immediately identified. He was always under surveillance. I understand he was in custody within 14 minutes and at no stage did he threaten any aircraft or any of the personnel in that region. -  - It is a fact that some people will, from time to time, choose to break the law. There needs to be a range of systems in place to secure an area. -  - There needs to be surveillance activities and there also needs to be a capacity to apprehend those people who do break through an early line. This is, in fact, an example of a security system actually working. When the person was identified, he was apprehended. That is, of course, what we expect to do. Police do not always stop people from speeding but, from time to time, they arrest those who do. In this particular instance, the man was clearly identified and apprehended. The government is taking a range of measures to improve security at Australian airports. There is already a significant level of security that is multifaceted. - We have significant arrangements in relation to perimeter fencing, but there are also other measures to apprehend anyone who may break through that initial barrier. - We have also commissioned Sir John Wheeler to do an external review of the airport security arrangements around Australia. That review is quite well advanced. The government expects to receive a report from Sir John Wheeler within a month or so, and it will respond further to any recommendations which he makes. But in relation to the particular incident that the honourable member referred to, at no stage were any aircraft at risk. The gentleman concerned, I understand, is receiving medical assistance at the present time, but at no stage was any passenger or any aircraft at risk as a result of this ingress.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for that question. It touches upon the living standards of low- and middle-income Australians, and there is probably no person in this House who has a better sensitivity for their concerns and needs than the member for Greenway. The good news is that the mantra that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is wrong according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is a mantra we have heard repeatedly from those who sit opposite, but the figures that came out last Friday are a stunning repudiation of that mantra. They are also a very strong endorsement of the social justice approach which has underlaid the policies of this government for the last 9½ years. What these figures disclose is that, over the period 1995 to 2003-04, the average household income in Australia grew by 20.7 per cent in real terms. This is adding wages, tax benefits and government transfer payments together so that you get a measurement of the real position of Australian households.What was really welcome about this finding was that the real incomes of low- and middle-income households increased by a proportionately greater amount - that is, 22 per cent - than the real incomes of the richest households, which increased by 19.3 per cent over the same period: low- and middle-income households up by 22 per cent; rich households up by 19.3 per cent. 
An opposition member - Rubbish! - He says it is rubbish. We have got the trades hall statistician instead of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is not rubbish; it is reality. It is all of a piece with the findings of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, presided over by Ann Harding, which showed again and again in successive surveys that, as a result of the policies of this government, the households that have benefited the most are the low- and middle-income households.It is all of a piece with the experience of the Australian public. I find that, as I go around this country, the Australian public know that the best friend the workers of Australia have ever had is the Howard government. The Australian people know that. I repeat that the proudest boast I had in the last election campaign - particularly, but not only, in Western Sydney - was that under this government taxation has fallen, inflation has fallen, interest rates have fallen and wages have gone up. And now we have independent confirmation that the greater wage increases have, in fact, occurred in the lower income brackets.Can I simply say to those who sit opposite and to other critics of the government that the facts are on the side of this government. We have been a friend of the Australian battler. We have been a friend of the Australian worker. We have lifted their living standards. Under us, real wages have risen by 14 per cent; under Labor, they rose by a miserable two per cent. Under us, the minimum wage has risen by 12 per cent in real terms; under Hawke and Keating, it fell by five per cent in real terms. The record and the facts are there. We are the friends of the Australian workers. We are not engaged in rhetoric for Australian workers; we actually deliver outcomes for their benefit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia released its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy and noted:... the economy continues to be characterised by a solid pace of growth ... and by strong labour market conditions.The Reserve Bank also noted that there was a 'mild downturn now under way' in housing. This is something that I have been pointing forward to for quite some time. The Reserve Bank also noted:Households now seem to have entered a phase in which they are consolidating their balance sheets ...Again, this is something to be welcomed. This is happening at a time when there are other factors supporting spending and activity. According to the Reserve Bank:Employment has been expanding strongly ... contributing to growth in household incomes, as are the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 July.All members of the House will welcome the fact that, since we last met, every Australian income tax payer received a tax cut on 1 July this year. Of course, that was the tax cut which the Labor Party opposed. It believed that no-one should have a tax cut on 1 July. Whilst I am on my feet, I will say that, as far as I know, the Australian Labor Party has not changed its policy, which means that, according to the policy of the Australian Labor Party, tax rates today should be higher and people should hand back the tax cuts that they got in the month of July. This is from the Leader of the Opposition who brought you the policy beginning with 'r' - the policy of rollback.The Reserve Bank's report on the Australian economy is consistent with the government's own view that the economy will continue to grow in a sustainable way and that it is marked by low inflation. Of course, if we can keep inflation low - within the two to three per cent band which the government has set by agreement with the Reserve Bank - it will mean a continuation of the low interest rate regime which has been so beneficial to Australia's families. It does not mean that the government can rest on its laurels; there is still more economic reform to be done. This is the government that intends to do it. We say to the Australian Labor Party: if it is serious about getting credibility on economic matters, support this government's reform agenda.</DOC>

 - This side of the House believes that unfair dismissal laws -  -  - I actually am on this side of the House. - That is a big point from the member for Grayndler, one of Labor's intellectuals - and we wish the new member for Marrickville good luck in the preselection battles that are going on in New South Wales. Unfair dismissals, a litigious solution, do inhibit employment intentions - that is, if people believe that they can be subject to very capricious legal action which is time consuming and expensive, they tend to be conservative in their employment intentions. This is not just a view that is held by this government; this is a view which has been reported on by the OECD and the IMF, and I notice that there was a report over the weekend from Access Economics which was commissioned by the Business Council of Australia. Unemployment is now at a 30-year low in Australia. It is probably at the lowest that we will see in cyclical terms, which is a 30-year low. If we want to take unemployment lower in this country, we need structural reform. We need to get rid of job-destroying, capricious legal actions. We need to give small business a go. This is the side of the House that believes in economic reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. A lot of constituents in the electorate of Mallee have made significant contributions to the export effort in the last 12 months. In 2004-05 Australia recorded a new export record level, with $162.3 billion worth of exports going out of Australia. That has never been achieved before in Australia's history. Bear in mind that when we came to office in 1996 the figure was $99 billion. So, in the life of the coalition government, exports have gone from an annual figure of $99 billion to $162.3 billion. In the last year we have seen a 13 per cent increase in our exports. That has been to the significant credit of all the exporting businesses across Australia and the hundreds of thousands of people who are employed in that sector. During the year we saw record coal exports, record metal ores and minerals exports, record services exports, record numbers of tourists and record exports as far as educational services are concerned. We saw very strong growth in manufacturing exports and in rural exports, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances caused by the drought.Yesterday's Reserve Bank report noted:The global expansion is continuing to provide a favourable backdrop for the Australian economy.Of course, the Australian economy relies very heavily on exporting out of this country and getting into the markets of the world. Australia's terms of trade have not been better for 30 years. They are forecast to reach a level where they have not been better for 50 years. - The important point to make is that we cannot just rest on our laurels on these export figures. We cannot just rest on our laurels and say, 'We've reached this level.' We have to keep on driving the process of change. We have to continue to improve the economic circumstances in Australia so the productivity, the efficiency and the competitiveness of our exporting industries remain ahead of most of our major competitors.We must remain ahead of our competitors across the world and this cannot be done without continuing the reform process. In the life of our government we have reformed the waterfront to the benefit of our exporting industries. Our exporting industries were also significant beneficiaries of the GST tax reforms. Those tax reforms took billions of dollars worth of taxes off the back of our exports. Today we are proposing new reforms in the area of workplace relations, specifically targeting the ability to make our exporting industries more competitive and more productive so they can better compete in the global marketplace and so we can continue to generate new and better paid jobs. These figures did not just happen; they came through a lot of hard work on our economy. They will not continue unless we are prepared to continue the pace of reform in the national interest.</DOC>

 - Never bank on a fair repetition of a quote from this side of the House by the mob who sit opposite. Let me simply say that the government has announced its policy, and that policy is to remove the unfair dismissal laws on up to 100. That will be legislated.While I am on my feet, can I just remind those who sit opposite of a few realities in relation to the effect of these unfair dismissal laws. These unfair dismissal laws are not some ancient Magna Carta right. They were introduced by Laurie Brereton in 1994 and they have in fact had the effect of destroying - not producing - jobs. We want to change the unfair dismissal laws in the name of lifting employment.We draw on the evidence of other countries. It is very interesting that those countries that have the lowest unemployment are those countries that have the less heavily regulated labour markets. Those that have the highest unemployment, such as Germany and France, are those that have the most heavily regulated labour markets. By abolishing the unfair dismissal laws in relation to firms with up to 100 employees, we will be generating jobs for small business and we will be removing the disincentive and intimidating effect of these laws.I remind those who sit opposite that this has been a commitment of this government since 1995. We went to the 1996 election pledging to get rid of Labor's unreasonable unfair dismissal laws and we believe the proposal to remove them on businesses of up to 100 employees strikes the right balance and will be of immense benefit to the small business men and women of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I can refer him to some reports that bolster the case for reform of industrial relations in this country, and I ask the House to listen to them. The first report I would refer him to is the OECD's economic survey of Australia in February 2005. The OECD said this of Australia:To further encourage participation and favour employment, the industrial relations system ... needs to be reformed so as to increase the flexibility of the labour market.In its last report on Australia in November 2004, the IMF said of Australia:... the wage bargaining system needs further simplification, including a reduction in the overlap of the federal and state award systems and a diminished role of the award system in setting the minimum wage, which has contributed to a relatively high unemployment rate for low-skilled workers.When the Governor of the Reserve Bank was giving testimony before the House standing committee in February 2005, he was asked how to boost Australia's productivity performance and he said:The biggest thing in this area is industrial relations reform. There must be a lot of things that still can be done.There we have, lining up with recommendations for further industrial relations reform in Australia, the OECD, the IMF and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Who is lining up against further reform of economic matters in this country? We have an article written by the member for Lilley in today's Australian Financial Review. - That well-known economic theorist, the member for Lilley, says that the industrial relations well is dry - 'No more reform can be done on industrial relations. We don't want more reform in this country. The industrial relations well is dry.' He quoted labour economist David Peetz in support of his proposition. I do not know David Peetz, but a very quick survey on this independent voice quoted by the member for Lilley finds that David Peetz, under the auspices of the ACTU, has been conducting research for the last 18 months into the experience and performance of union officials and delegates. A search of the Workers Online magazine finds that David Peetz is described as its resident bard who writes poems for Workers Online. He not only writes poems; it further emerges that David Peetz sings in the trade union choir. He sings songs that he himself writes, including one called You're fired - which apparently is sung to the tune of Rawhide. Famous as he is, he is not Australia's most famous vocalist. Australia's most famous vocalist, of course, is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who sings songs like It's now or never, as I recall.Anyway, here is a question for the House of Representatives. Those in favour of economic reform are the OECD, the IMF and the Reserve Bank; those against are the member for Lilley and David Peetz. I wonder who would be the more reliable advisers on this particular matter. Would it be possible that David Peetz and Wayne Swan know what is better for the Australian industrial relations system than the OECD, the IMF and the Reserve Bank governor? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I am not going to spoil you with a song today, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Casey for his question and, if I may say so, the interest he personally shows in Australia's relations with Asia. I do not think there is any doubt that Australia's relationship with ASEAN is at a historic high. I am - and I know that the government as a whole is - particularly delighted that Australia has been invited by ASEAN to participate in the East Asia Summit and to be present at the birth of what could turn out to be a dynamic East Asian community.I do not think I could overstate the importance of this achievement. The first summit will be held on 14 December in Kuala Lumpur and will bring together the leaders of ASEAN, China, India, Korea, Japan and, of course, Australia and New Zealand. This East Asia Summit brings together the most dynamic economies in the world, with 49 per cent of the world's population and 21 per cent of global trade. It is an enormous step forward for this country to participate in our engagement with Asia through the East Asia Summit and to upgrade our relations with our own region in this way.This, after all, has been a very significant period for our relations with Asia; it has been a historic period. We have begun negotiations on an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement. We have had visits this year from the leaders of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. We have seen a 49 per cent increase in our two-way trade with ASEAN over the last six years. Practical cooperation - in particular, in areas such as counter-terrorism - through our 11 memoranda of understanding and also a series of bilateral initiatives with our partners has been absolutely critical.I notice that the Leader of the Opposition says we should do more with Asia in countering terrorism. He is clearly not aware of the establishment of the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation and not aware of the massive engagement we have not only with Indonesia but also with other countries of the region in assisting with counter-terrorism activities.Let me conclude by making this point: the Labor Party and some of their fellow travellers - commentators and some of their fellow travellers in the media - have criticised this government for being too close to the United States of America, because they believe, amongst other things, that would damage our relations with Asia. That has been proven to be totally false. In a period when the Prime Minister was in Washington with President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, consolidating the closest relationship Australia has ever had with the United States, we developed an initiative to get into the East Asia Summit which brought us closer than we have ever been to the East Asian community. If another political party could achieve that, I would be very surprised.</DOC>

 - The award system will remain in place -  -  - I presume the honourable member wants the answer to the question he asked. The award system will remain in place and those workers who choose, usually through their unions, to arrange their industrial affairs via the awards will continue to be able to do so. The reality is that workers have left awards in their droves because under both collective and individual agreements they are better off because they are able to negotiate a better outcome for themselves.We had some questions earlier about the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission in relation to the so-called family leave test case. This highlights the bizarre nature of the current system, the award system which the Labor Party wants to defend. In order to resolve a dispute you have to create one in the first place. That is what the Labor Party wants to defend. In order to get permission to go and talk to your employer, you have to go off under an ambit claim to the Industrial Relations Commission. This is the bizarre system which the honourable member seems to be defending. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him and the House that over 725,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into by Australian workers since they were introduced in 1997. We know the Labor Party does not like this, but in the last 12 months alone 200,000 Australian workers have entered into Australian workplace agreements.In fact, at present it is reported in the West Australian - in the Leader of the Opposition's home state - that one of the major utilities, one of the essential service providers in Western Australia, Western Power, is negotiating Australian workplace agreements. The managing director of Western Power, reported in the West Australian this morning, said it is important for any business in a competitive environment to have the flexibility of Australian workplace agreements. This is interesting against the background of a report in the Australian of last Friday headed 'Scrapping AWAs 'would lose worker votes''. The report says this:He - this is the Leader of the Opposition - said these people - many from Labor's old heartland in the western suburbs had signed Australian Workplace Agreements or were self-employed.And Labor could not desert them by sticking to its policy of abolishing AWAs at the next election and then expect to receive their support.Why would he lose their support? Because, on average, workers on Australian workplace agreements are better off by some 13 per cent than those on collective agreements. That is why he is concerned that his policy to scrap Australian workplace agreements would not be supported by the very people he would want to support him in the coming election.What we have at present is the Leader of the Opposition trying to walk both sides of the road. On the one hand he is trying to say, 'We'll maintain our policy to scrap Australian workplace agreements,' but on the other hand he is trying to send a message to people who are on Australian workplace agreements, 'No, we'll leave them alone; we won't scrap them.' The reality is that what the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition want to do is to strangle Australian workplace agreements by stealth, the very thing which the Gallop government did in Western Australia when it won power in that state. This has antagonised not just the union movement but the Leader of the Opposition's own colleagues in the caucus. The President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, came out expressing her disquiet about the member for Brand's flip-flopping over the issue. In fact, we have colleagues from the caucus reported as saying that they are getting edgy and that the Leader of the Opposition should adopt a black or white position on this issue, instead of vacillating in the way he is at present.Where does this lead? It was interesting to note that the one person not invited to the union picnic day on Sunday by Unions NSW was the Leader of the Opposition. Where was the Leader of the Opposition on Sunday? There were reports that there was this lonely figure walking along the road between the Wharf Restaurant and Doyles in Sydney - the road leading to The Gap. That sums up the position of the Leader of the Opposition at present: no friends in the labour movement over this issue and increasing disquiet from his own caucus because, once again, we have this flip-flopping from the member for Brand.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The answer to the question is yes. I also stand by my comments at that conference - the fact that the Bjelke-Petersen government started a lot of the workplace reform processes in Australia in the 1980s when the electrical trade unions were holding Queensland to ransom over power supplies. I made the point in my speech as well that the Queensland branch of the National Party and the Queensland government under Bjelke-Petersen were absolutely committed to workplace relations reform. It started back then and has been continued under our government on the basis that we want to see a much more productive and competitive workplace in Australia to generate more jobs and better paid jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and his interest in the ongoing reform of the building and construction industry, an industry which he had some considerable personal experience in prior to coming to this parliament. This week the government will introduce into the parliament amendments to establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which will be charged with investigating and prosecuting unlawful conduct in the commercial building and construction industry. This is a key plank, a key response, to the findings of the Cole royal commission which found that the commercial building and construction industry in Australia was rife with unlawful and corrupt conduct, particularly in Western Australia, the state of the member for Hasluck, and also in Victoria. The rate of industrial disputation in the building industry is almost five times the national average of all industries, and it is even worse in Western Australia.We had the example just last week of the construction on the Perth to Mandurah railway project which was hit by industrial action when 200 CFMEU members all took sickies on the one day; the so-called 'blue flu'. This was not unexpected, because on 11 July, after a similar incident, Unions WA secretary, Dave Robinson, also commended such tactics saying:We will consider every form of action and a lot of that, I can tell you, from now on will be quite creative.In light of this quite clearly blatant industrial action by the CFMEU in Western Australia, we have a Western Australian state government, whose taxpayers' money has an interest in this particular project, showing itself entirely incapable of addressing the unlawful and corrupt behaviour in that state's building industry. The industrial relations minister in Western Australia, Mr Kobelke, said on ABC Radio:There is a high level of disputation in the building and construction industry in Western Australia and that is something which we think should not be happening.It should not be happening according to Mr Kobelke, but then when asked what he would do about it, this is what he said:I certainly will be talking to the union to point out to them that this is not only causing disruptions to the industry it is really giving them a very, very bad name, and I think that should be of some concern to them.He went on to say:It is also incumbent upon the union to look and see why these things are happening and hopefully they will have a change of heart so that these matters will not continue.Here we have Mr Kobelke in Western Australia saying to Kevin Reynolds, 'Listen, mate, I think you should have a change of heart,' but saying to the CFMEU, which has donated $4.9 million to the Australian Labor Party, 'Come on, mates, let's just have a change of heart.' The reality is that this is a weak response once again from the Western Australian Labor Party. They know that change is needed to clean up the corruption and, in some cases, the criminal behaviour which occurs in this industry.What has the Australian Labor Party done in relation to corruption in this industry? It opposed the Cole royal commission; it opposed the establishment of the building industry task force; it opposed the establishment of the Building and Construction Commission. At the last election we had a policy from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, to abolish the building industry task force. The reality is that this is a weak response from the ALP. It knows there is a problem. Only this government will do something to clean up, once and for all, the corrupt and criminal behaviour in the building and construction industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. He represents one of the significant airports in regional Australia and is therefore particularly interested in these sorts of issues. Last month, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Attorney-General announced a range of measures to tighten Australia's aviation security. The government has now set about the task of implementing those commitments.Presently, 100 per cent of international checked baggage is screened to detect explosives and other dangerous devices, and we are taking steps to extend those measures to domestic airports. We are seeking to remove the legal impediments to the use of video surveillance devices which are not visible at airports - but with appropriate signage, of course. The criminal history of all those people who currently have aviation security identification cards is being reviewed, with a view to terminating the grandfathering arrangements which had existed under the previous safety regulations. We have committed $35 million to upgrading security arrangements at regional airports. Air site access is being significantly tightened, particularly for persons, goods and vehicles entering sensitive air site areas.I am aware that this morning the member for Brisbane had some comments to make about the use of photo identification for people boarding aircraft. That is, of course, among the many issues that governments consider in looking at what are the most appropriate security measures to put in place. There are some doubts as to whether the compulsory use of photo identification on boarding would be a major advantage. It is interesting to note that the United States 9/11 commission report indicated that all but one of the terrorists involved in the 11 September events in the United States had state issued photo IDs, but that did not do anything to stop the perpetration of those outrageous events.It is more important that we identify what people are carrying than that we identify who they actually are. That is why there has been such a significant emphasis placed on baggage and what people are carrying, and on ensuring that those who board aircraft are not carrying any of the devices that they might need to perpetrate an outrage similar to what we have seen in some other parts of the world.The Sir John Wheeler review that I referred to earlier is looking at a wide range of airport security measures. We have not closed the door on any options. But we do need to have an appropriate balance between assuring people's security on our public transport systems and enabling our economy to progress in a reasonably efficient way and ensure that people are able to move freely around this country to exercise their privileges as Australians.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Brisbane is continuing the tradition of the Labor Party in failing to understand the role that Mr Palmer has in relation to aviation security. His job is to investigate significant incidents that have occurred; he is not there to oversight the day-to-day aviation security arrangements. There are 250 other people in the department who take that responsibility very seriously. That is their job; they are doing it effectively. If there were to be an incident which required Mr Palmer to undertake an investigation, he would be called back to undertake that kind of investigation. There is not a requirement for that at present. The current arrangements are appropriate for the current circumstances.</DOC>

 - I welcome the Boeing employees and I have no doubt that they are very decent, patriotic Australians looking after their families. I am absolutely certain they are aware that over the last 9½ years their families have been better looked after than they were under a Labor government. They would be aware of that.Let me turn to the issue. At present, so I am told, Boeing employs over 2,000 people across Australia, of which about 380 are doing similar work to those who are on strike. About 31 employees are on strike, which represents less than 10 per cent of the aircraft maintenance work force, and more than 90 per cent of workers doing similar work do not support the strike and have stayed at work. I also understand that, at present, people at Boeing are employed under common-law contracts. I further understand that even the president of the ACTU supports common-law contracts, because I saw her say it two nights ago on Lateline.Insofar as the entitlement to negotiate a collective agreement is concerned, the existing law means that the company is within its rights in taking the position it is taking. It is fair and proper, under the existing law. I understand that the 31 employees can go back to work on their old terms or accept new terms that would see every one of them get a pay rise. It is their choice.The AWU want a collective agreement that includes annual pay increases of 10 per cent, annual increases on all allowances of 10 per cent, and other changes which would allow the union to intervene in the way the business is run. I understand that the workers are accompanied in Canberra today by Mr Bill Shorten of the AWU. But we all know why Bill is here: he is checking out the office of the member for Maribyrnong to see if it would be suitable for his purposes. I simply say to the hardworking, patriotic, dedicated employees to whom the Leader of the Opposition refers that they are, on my advice, entitled to return to work at any time. They can either go back on their old terms or accept new terms under which every one of them would get a pay rise. Under the existing law - not under the new law but under the existing law - what the company is doing is entirely lawful and entirely within its rights.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question and I can inform the House that it is three months, to the day, since the budget was brought down on 10 May. The good news is that this morning legislation passed the Senate to give a tax cut to every Australian - that is, Labor's campaign to defeat the tax cuts, which they have been engaging in for the last three months, is finally ended. If you want an illustration of how important it is to have a coalition majority in the Senate it is this: without a coalition majority in the Senate, no Australian would have got a tax cut on 1 July. The Labor Party defeated these tax cuts in the Senate twice. This House insisted on the tax cuts yesterday, and when they returned to the Senate this morning - get a load of this - the Labor Party did not even call a division, because it knew that a coalition majority would deliver a tax cut to every Australian.But there is more good news. The first bill that passed the new Senate today cut income tax for every Australian. The second bill that passed the Senate today abolishes the superannuation surcharge. Again the Australian Labor Party, when it had a majority in the Senate, was able to defeat that. Can I make it clear to Australians that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation did go through today, taxpayers have actually received their tax cut from 1 July 2005, because the commissioner published schedules instructing employers on how to pass it on and those schedules were not disallowed in the Senate. From the time of the budget until today, the Australian Labor Party had still determined not to determine its position in relation to those withholding schedules. But the good news is that Labor's campaign to defeat the tax cuts has been defeated and the coalition has now delivered an income tax cut to every Australian.</DOC>

 - As I have said before, my best guarantee is my record. -  - The Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him point furiously in the direction of a number of Australians who are with us today. They have shared, as all other Australians have shared, in the record prosperity of the last 9½ years. I remember 1995 and so do many workers in Australia remember 1995. They remember the 11 per cent unemployment that the Leader of the Opposition gave us, they remember the $10½ billion deficit that they left. -  - And they know and they remember -  - that over the last 9½ years we have achieved a fantastic quadrella. - I am giving the best guarantee of all: performance. This government has performed. This government has presided over an increase of 14 per cent in real terms in the wages of Australian workers. What did the Hawke and Keating governments give us? A miserable two per cent in 13 years. We have the lowest unemployment level in 30 years. We have just presided over a massive reduction in personal income tax, despite the best efforts of the Leader of the Opposition to block tax cuts. -  - I wonder whether he told our visitors in the gallery today that he spent the last three months running around Australia trying to block income tax cuts. - The reality is that the workers of Australia, in financial terms, have been better served by a Liberal government than they were ever served by a Labor government. - And the greater the volume of interjections from the Leader of the Opposition, the more persuaded I am that he knows - and we know he knows - that, when it comes to a comparison of the record of this government and the record of previous governments, the Howard government is the best friend the workers of Australia have ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. Of course the member for Page, representing that seat on the north coast of New South Wales, understands full well the importance of a strong economy and good sound investment in infrastructure to underpin exports out of Australia. As I indicated yesterday, our strong economy has delivered a record level of exports in the last 12 months - over $162 billion worth of exports, a lot of them coming out of the electorate of the member for Page and, I might add, being carried to the ports on state highways that the federal government has had to invest money in, like the Pacific Highway on the east coast of New South Wales particularly in the member for Page's electorate.A strong domestic economy is of critical importance to the competitiveness of our export industries. We have continued to produce budget surpluses, keeping downward pressure on interest rates, we have unemployment down to five per cent and we have almost eliminated government debt - all key indicators in terms of the strength of our economy and of creating a much more competitive environment for our exporters to do well in the international marketplace. But most importantly, running a sound economy, running a good economy and getting rid of federal government debt enables the government to invest more in infrastructure and is a critical element of the competitive nature of our exports. For example, we have invested $12.7 billion in our road and rail infrastructure through the AusLink program, overseen by the former minister for transport; $260 million in the rail infrastructure of the Hunter Valley, rail infrastructure that had been totally ignored by the state Labor government of New South Wales; and $150 million in rail and port links in Melbourne, infrastructure that had been ignored by the state Labor government of Victoria. Since 1997 we have invested over a billion dollars in telecommunication services - vital for Australia's export industries to remain competitive - particularly $157 million in regional broadband services. - So it is very important that we recognise the significance that a strong economy plays in providing a platform for our exports. We have had to pick that up as the Labor Party let that run down. We only need to point to one thing: between 1993 and 1995 the Labor Party -  - took a decision to switch off the analog phone service in regional Australia. They were going to switch it off with no replacement and leave no services in regional Australia. We had to step in and replace that with a CDMA network to give mobile telecommunications to regional Australia. We had to introduce CDMA after the Labor Party switched the analog service off. It just goes to show you that over the life of our government the reform agenda and all the ideas are coming from this side of the House and not the other side of the House. We are still pushing ahead with the reform agenda that is going to deliver a stronger economy and a more competitive environment for Australia's exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. I informed the House yesterday of the prospects for the Australian economy as reported by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its statement on the conduct of monetary policy. Overnight the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates again by a quarter of one per cent. This is the 10th successive increase in official interest rates in the United States, taking its official cash rate from one per cent to 3½ per cent.This is actually a good sign. It is a sign that authorities in the United States are confident that the United States economy is recovering from the disappointing recession that that country had in 2000 and 2001. That will underline global economic strength in the year to come, as will the expansion under way in China, which shows no sign of abating with the Chinese economy growing at around nine per cent. The Japanese economy is showing recovery and was much stronger in 2005 than in 2004. Taking all of these developments together, we have had the strongest two-year period of world economic growth in around 30 years. Of course, the expansion in China and Japan in particular has supported the demand for Australian commodities.Also, the Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment was released today. It shows a very strong rebound in consumer sentiment in Australia. In August the index of consumer sentiment rose 7.6 per cent to be 115.7 per cent. This is well above the long-term average for consumer sentiment and there is no doubt that one of the things that have led the rebound in consumer sentiment in Australia is more certainty about the interest rate climate. There is also no doubt that consumer sentiment would have been boosted in the last month by tax cuts. The measures which took effect on 1 July have already delivered something like $350 million of tax cuts to Australian income tax payers.Of course, they are the tax cuts that the Australian Labor Party opposed. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, no Australian would have got a tax cut on 1 July. Because the Australian Labor Party was unsuccessful, every Australian got a tax cut on 1 July 2005. This supports hardworking Australian families. It will improve the incentive under the Australian taxation system. We have seen the rebound in relation to consumer sentiment. Whilst we expect growth to be solid in the coming year, it will be growth on a low-inflation basis, which will give certainty to families in the year that lies ahead.</DOC>

With regard to my remarks yesterday, I confirmed what was in a speech that I gave to the Queensland National Party conference. -  - If you read the transcript of the speech, you would find that the word 'guarantee' did not appear. - No, I did not. I did not use the word 'guarantee'. What I can say to the people from my electorate that the member referred to in his question is that I guarantee that this government is going to continue to deliver the economic circumstances in Australia that we have delivered for the last nine and a half years. We have pushed unemployment down across Australia and in my electorate. - I was asked about 11,000 people who work in my electorate. I have been outlining what this government has done for them during my representation of that electorate and, indeed, our time in office. We will continue to deliver those circumstances so they can continue to prosper in the way they have done over the last nine and a half years. Real wages in Australia and in my electorate have gone up by 14 per cent during the time we have been in office, which is something that never happened under Labor.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his interest in this important issue. There is no doubt that Australian uranium resources make a significant contribution to our own national prosperity. We have an estimated 30 per cent of the world's medium-cost uranium resources, and last financial year our exports earned nearly $500 million. So this is a significant resource. Australian uranium exports account for around two per cent of the world's total electricity production, and countries using our uranium avoid carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions they avoid are roughly equivalent to Australia's entire annual CO emissions, so there is no doubt that our uranium exports make a significant contribution to mitigating the impact of human activity on climate change.It is obviously vital to ensure that our uranium exports are used exclusively for peaceful purposes and contribute, therefore, to the international non-proliferation regime. We have been able to do that for many years. I think it started during the term of the Fraser government, actually, which negotiated treaty level nuclear safeguard conditions. We currently have 19 nuclear agreements covering 36 countries, including four of the five nuclear weapons states - that is, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia.Yesterday I announced that Australia will formally commence negotiations on an agreement with the fifth nuclear weapons state, China. China is the world's second largest energy consumer and has a very high projected growth in electricity demand. China's demand for uranium by 2020 is estimated to increase fourfold. In fact, the total consumption by China in 2020 would be the equivalent of our total uranium exports this year. So diversifying from fossil fuels will result in lower greenhouse emissions in China, and that obviously will be very desirable. Our officials held exploratory talks in Beijing on the proposed agreement, and we will be having further talks. We hope that the agreement can be finalised before too long, and it will be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.I will conclude by making the point that I can assure the Australian public that we will not, in the case of our negotiations with China, dilute our nuclear safeguards standards. The agreement we have with China must be an agreement which is comparable and commensurate with the agreements we have with other nuclear weapons states and with non-nuclear weapons states as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question, because it goes to the heart of the government's proposed workplace relations reform. The government believes that it is time to have one single system of workplace relations in Australia. We believe that this will be to the advantage of the Australian economy, because it will help to drive increased wages and jobs for ordinary Australians. In addition to that, the removal of the duplication which currently exists would cut red tape for business and it would amount to a saving for the states of some $120 million annually. That is $120 million which could be better expended on health services, education and police - essential services in the states. This is something which many of the state Labor leaders actually support. As long ago as 1990 the former long-serving Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said: - In Sussex Street they do not have a ballot. - As I was attempting to inform the House, in 1990 Bob Carr, the former Premier of New South Wales, said:In a nation of 17 million people struggling to modernise its economy, seven separate systems of industrial regulation are an absurd luxury.Indeed, this sentiment was repeated by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, who said that the Victorian ALP supported 'the concept of a single national system of industrial relations, and it always has'. He went on to say:It can deliver benefits to both employees and employers by creating a uniform national framework for dispute resolution and the application of minimum employment standards that can be more easily complied with and enforced.Those are the views of two Labor premiers about the need for, and the desirability of, a national system. We know that some in the federal parliamentary Labor Party actually support a national system. On 20 February this year, one of them said:It is possible to consider, in the abstract or hypothetically, a single or a unitary system. It's not a novel policy idea, and you can contemplate a whole range of efficiencies that would occur in the economy and in the system if that were to take place.I wonder who said that? -  - So who was it in the federal Labor Party who was arguing for the economic benefits of a single national system in a Sunday Sunrise interview on 20 February this year? It was none other than the member for Perth. It was the opposition spokesman on workplace relations who was arguing the advantages, the economic benefits, of a single national system. - This was not the last time that the member for Perth argued the economic benefits of a single national system. In a doorstop interview at Parliament House on 12 April he said:It's not a novel idea, in fact it was first raised when Labor was last in office. You can think of a range of economic efficiencies that make it attractive.In other words, this is of economic benefit to Australia. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that there was no economic rationale whatsoever and, in an indication of how bereft of policy ideas the Labor Party is, the shadow Treasurer said that the well was dry. The policy well is certainly dry in the Labor Party. They have run out of ideas. This is in the national interest. For once the Labor Party ought to act in the national interest rather than in the interests of the union bosses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and his obvious continued interest in this issue. Ninety per cent of all tourism businesses in this country are small businesses. They understand the need for industrial relations reform - in fact, they believe it is vitally important. The National Tourism Alliance represents over ninety per cent of all tourism industry operators representing businesses involved in accommodation, anything to do with airlines, car touring, retail travel agencies, any business tourism, the meetings industry, farm and country tourism, youth hostels, retail, adventure operators, the caravan and the camping industry, and restaurants and catering. So you can see that this is an organisation that represents the vast majority of all those small businesses operating in the tourism industry.I think that we need to have a look at what Mr Col Hughes, who is the Chairman of the National Tourism Alliance, said. He said that he reaffirmed the tourism industry's support for a continuing review of work practices that will deliver greater flexibility and greater productivity for both employees and employers in the tourism industry. He said, 'The NTA will continue to work closely with the Howard Government to ensure the legislation takes shape, that domestic tourism and the overall tourism industry benefit from the creation of a more flexible work environment.'Mr Chris Brown, whom many opposite would be well aware of, and who is the Managing Director of the Tourism and Transport Forum, said that the tourism industry believes 'continuing reform of the labour market has the capacity to deliver greater competitiveness, job creation and productivity growth for the tourism sector. 'The industry,' he said, 'will continue to work with government to develop labour market reforms that will generate growth in the Australian economy and in the tourism industry especially'. - I am coming to the Leader of the Opposition's comments. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that those in the tourist industry have taken great notice of what the Leader of the Opposition has said. To illustrate the sort of reform that the government is supporting and will ensure for small business, let us look at the example of a Lowenbrau chef who took five months leave and combined it with studying in Asia. His employer saw the value of this and the chef negotiated time without pay. The employer continued to pay his superannuation for the entire time he was away, and on his return the chef resumed full employment.The Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he believes that methods to promote flexibility in the work force and that encourage jobs growth should be strangled. Small businesses in the tourism industry know exactly what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. - They would like to strangle him, Prime Minister. This government understands that one size does not fit all; it understands the value of flexibility. They know that the opposition does not, and they know exactly what the opposition stands for. - I didn't read every word.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. The government is determined to see that Australia's 715,000 university students will from next year be free to choose whether they will join a student union, guild or association or whether they will not join it. In fact, that is a principle that goes right across this government: that every Australian should be free to join and be represented by a union or, alternatively, to not join that union and to purchase services or seek representation wherever they like. That is the fundamental principle here, and this is why the Labor Party is so concerned: because it knows that come January next year, when this legislation will have been passed, when those Australians turn up at a university campus to get an education and they are given the choice of joining the union, guild or association - whether it is the toga club, the abseiling club or the rowing club - most of them will want to exercise the right to be free to choose.The Labor Party is taking the arrogant position that says that young adult Australians in the 21st century are in some way incapable of making a decision as to what they will spend their hard-earned money on. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition one thing I know - in fact, I will tell you two facts. I would like to know how many people are sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition that do not support Labor's opposition to tax cuts, and how many people are sitting behind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who are totally opposed to Labor's hit list on private schools? When you have sorted that out, then start asking us some questions.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Makin for her question. In response, let me remind the House that, as the Prime Minister and all the state Labor premiers and chief ministers declared just last month, Australia has one of the world's best health systems. Even the member for Lalor herself has woken up to this, saying yesterday that by world standards we have a good system. This is a government which does not just talk about Medicare but makes the adjustments necessary to make a good system even better.We do not have enough doctors in this country, but there are five per cent more doctors in equivalent full-time work force terms now than in 1996, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. The health system is not just doctors. Doctors are important, but it is very important that all health professionals are working together rather than working in isolation from each other. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, there are 1,100 nurses in country general practice. Thanks to the policies put in place under Strengthening Medicare, there are now 600 nurses in urban general practice. For the first time, there is a specific Medicare item that recognises the good work of nurses. For the first time, allied health professionals - such as psychologists, physiotherapists, dieticians, podiatrists, occupational therapists and so on - have been brought within the Medicare net.In the first 12 months, the allied health professional measure has resulted in 248,000 allied health professional consultations being supported under Medicare. That is not as many as we would have liked, but under changes put in place from 1 July we expect 300,000 team care plans will be put in place each year in the future - more good news from the Howard government. The improvements keep coming from the Howard government, which is why the Australian people are confident that the Howard government -  -  - The message is getting through, and the opposition know it! The Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

Actually, my life has been lacking, and that is probably the reason why: I have not read that speech that he gave on the weekend.

 - I thank the member for Moore. I know that he is a member who is concerned about the issue of climate change. He is one of many members - probably all members on this side of the House - who is pleased with the announcement that we made, with a number of other countries, on 28 July in Vientiane of the formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This brings together six of the key Asia Pacific countries that are going to pursue a technology focused pro-growth approach to addressing climate change. It seems to me that is just a commonsense thing to do.The six countries are Australia itself, of course, the United States, Japan, China, India and Korea. We represent roughly 50 per cent of the global population's GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. I expect other countries to join down the track, given the support there has been around the world for this initiative. Mr Speaker, if you take the so-called annex 1 countries in the Kyoto protocol - that is, the countries that have signed up to a so-called binding target - they account for only 13 per cent of the world's population, 36 per cent of the world's energy use and 32 per cent of emissions. That is pretty small beer compared with the Asia Pacific partnership. The partnership is designed not to replace but to complement the Kyoto protocol, but the government is realistic enough to know that Kyoto is not a perfect solution.The Labor Party says that we should abandon the partnership and we should focus on Kyoto. This is the proposition. I do not think people know this but, if you take the period between 1990 and 2010, if it had not been for Kyoto and its targets, global emissions would have increased by 41 per cent. With Kyoto's binding targets, global emissions will increase instead by 40 per cent. That is progress. Instead of emissions increasing by 41 per cent, they will increase by 40 per cent. It is progress, but it is not a lot of progress. And, what is more, that assumes that all of those countries that have signed up to those targets will meet those targets. That, if I may say so, is almost certainly not going to happen. The partnership is bringing together the world's biggest emitters, the United States, China and India, to address the issues -  - and those countries are not included in the Kyoto targets system. You can tell from the interjections, Mr Speaker, that Labor is opposed to the partnership; I understand that. When it comes to alternative views, other countries, including Kyoto signatories, have welcomed the partnership. The British Chief Government Scientist said that this was 'very much in line with what we've been trying to do'. The Canadian foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew - Canada is a big Kyoto champion - said, 'This is progress.' Also, the European Commission spokesperson said, 'We welcome very much this agreement.' What did the Labor Party say? The Leader of the Opposition said of this partnership, which includes the United States, China, India, Korea and Japan, 'This is spin.' That is what he said - 'It is nothing.' - 'It' is not my presentation, as a matter of fact; 'it' was the partnership. Do not mislead. 'It' was the partnership - 'It is nothing; it is spin.' So the Americans are just spin, are they, and the Japanese and the Chinese? The Labor Party, which is always telling us how it has a monopoly over love for Asia, says that these countries are just masters of spin. - No endeavour to reinterpret your own words is going to extricate you from this. The member for Grayndler says that it is me. But he said on 27 July that the 'regional climate change pact is little more than Government spin' - not what the government had said but that the pact was 'little more than government spin'. On St Valentine's Day, Labor sent around Valentine's Day cards saying that it cared about climate change -  - but it rejects the partnership and champions a proposal that will see emissions increase by 40 per cent. Talk about spin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. It is rather interesting that a number of the members opposite have stickers on their chests that I think read 'I love uni services'.

In fact, we encourage students who go to university to join all kinds of things, such as cultural, sporting, political -  - Mr Speaker, I can barely cope. - The Prime Minister is putting me off. There is a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and its support for university services and support for university services on this side. On this side, we believe that students - mature young adults who work very hard for their after-tax money - should be free to choose which services on a university campus they are going to purchase. The Labor Party, on the other hand -  - The Labor Party, which loves taxes, is determined that there will continue to be a flat tax, otherwise known as a union fee, paid by every single student in the country.

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I know of her considerable interest in these matters. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee who are considering an exposure draft bill dealing with changes to the Family Law Act which will be complemented by the most significant changes to family law when we implement the new family relationship centres. These are the centrepiece, of course, of our initiatives and almost $400 million is committed in the budget over time to the implementation of those centres.I was pleased last Sunday week to attend with the member for Lindsay in Penrith an event where I was able to announce the location of the first 15 centres to be established. They are Lismore, Sutherland, Wollongong, Penrith, Mildura, Sunshine, Frankston, Ringwood, Townsville, Strathpine, Joondalup, Salisbury, Darwin, Hobart and Canberra. I did spend last week in a number of those locations in meetings discussing the implementation arrangements for this substantial initiative of the government. I have to say that the very well-attended meetings organised in so many locations reinforced in me an appreciation of the depth of feeling in our community about this issue and of the fact that we have to have a very clear focus on resolving issues in relation to family law in the best interests of children and at times their fundamental right - all other things being equal - to know both parents.I notice the member for Gellibrand has had some comments to make about our selection of new centres. One of the observations she made that I saw in a statement she released was that any priority in the running of centres should be given to existing established services. While I think that many of those do provide very important services to the communities they serve, one should not see them as being the only groups who have the capacity to help in this area. We certainly value the work that they have undertaken and that is why we have dramatically expanded service delivery. But I think what the opposition fails to understand in relation to this matter is that we are not only about changing the system; we want to change the culture. That means you need to be prepared to be open enough to recognise that there is a range of people and organisations with skills that ought to also be drawn upon in this very difficult area. I would encouraging the Labor Party to put aside its sniping from the sidelines and to support the most significant reforms to the family law system that we have seen in over a generation.</DOC>

 - I can inform the honourable member for Goldstein that, for the second month in a row, the unemployment rate of Australia has reached a 29-year low. Unemployment in Australia is now at five per cent, and it can go even lower if we have further workplace relations reform. The reason we want workplace relations reform is that we know that the good results of today are the products of yesterday's reforms and that, if we are to have even better figures tomorrow, we must continue the process of reform. Those on this side of the House do not believe for a moment that the job of reforming the Australian economy has been completed. We are not willing on this side of the House to settle for a growth rate of one or two per cent; we want a growth rate of three, four or even five per cent in the years ahead, and we can only have that if we have the courage to embrace further reform.Just as the predictions made by the Chicken Littles on the other side of the House 10 years ago that labour market reform in 1996 would drive wages down, destroy working conditions, increase unemployment and slash living conditions were proved to be wrong, so it is that those who seek to denigrate our reform agenda now will be proved wrong in the years ahead if this parliament embraces the government's reform package. The figures released this morning show that a further 12,700 new jobs were created in Australia in July. Full-time employment went down but part-time employment rose by 27,200. More than 350,000 new jobs have been created in the past year alone. The labour force participation rate remained - and this is very significant - at a record high of 64.7 per cent. Of the 350,000 new jobs created over the past year, more than 320,000 of them have been filled by new workers entering the labour market - a further piece of field evidence that the Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had.</DOC>

The government will provide information to Australians in accordance with the conventions used by other governments of different political persuasions over time. We will do that because the Australian people are faced with a misleading and deceptive campaign by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We will continue to reassure the Australian people that these changes will lead to even more jobs for Australians and higher wages, something that today's employment figures justify in terms of past reforms. Finally can I say that, in relation to the fine gentleman mentioned by the member for Perth, if he had some in his party maybe they would not always be in opposition.</DOC>

 - I slept very well last night. I pulled out Tony's speech and I was out like a light. I think I even got to the second paragraph. I told him that this morning. I was asked by the member for Bonner about labour market participation. I inform the House that the participation rate, which measures the proportion of Australians over 15 years of age who are looking for work, whether they are in work or out of work, in today's labour force figures is an all-time record - that is, more Australians than ever before seek to participate in the labour market. Why would that be the case? It is because the chances of getting a job in Australia today are better than they have been for the last 30 years. Unemployment is at five per cent. Over the course of this government's term of nine years, 1.7 million new jobs were created; in the course of the last year 350,000 new jobs were created, 64 per cent of which were full-time.It was not always thus that Australia had a five per cent unemployment rate. Many of us in this House can remember back to 1993. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition was at that time the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Does the House know what the unemployment rate in Australia was in 1993? The unemployment rate in 1993 was 10.7 per cent, more than double what it is today on a lower participation rate. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, as minister for employment - get a load of this - went to the National Press Club to deliver a speech on unemployment. He said:We draw perverse comfort from the European Commission's latest prediction that unemployment in the EC will average 12 per cent in 1994 compared with our current level of 10.7 per cent.The justification was: 10.7 per cent - but don't worry about it if you are unemployed, because the Europeans have unemployment at 12 per cent. Can you imagine where Australia would be now if it had not had to cope with an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent. - As I said, not only is the unemployment rate less than half the 10.7 per cent rate under the member for Brand but also it has been done with an increase in the participation rate which is at an all-time record. Of course if the participation rates in 1993 had been at the level they are now, the unemployment rate would have been far higher than 10.7 per cent, as it was under the member for Brand. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that participation rates are the highest we have ever had, on participation tables Australia is still only 12th in the OECD. That indicates that we should be aiming to increase the participation rate in Australia, even though that could have the effect in the short term of increasing the unemployment rate.This is why the government has announced reforms to the welfare system to encourage more people off DSP and into the work force and more people off income support and into the work force, because Australia has to lift its participation rate if we are going to get growth over the years to come. This is real economic reform. It is necessary with the ageing of the population. The government is focused on it. We have announced a program to do it, and it is an important part of building Australia's opportunities in future.</DOC>

 - My advice in relation to the 15-year-old worker was that she was not covered by a valid AWA; that the basis of the South Australian Industrial Relations Court finding was that the worker was a casual worker and not a part-time worker and was therefore found to have been underpaid according to the provisions of the South Australian award in relation to casual workers. The government supports a system where a worker has recourse for underpayment of wages, and according to the implication of the Leader of the Opposition this has no reference to the veracity of AWAs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question and, as a former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in New South Wales, he understands the great challenges that face the Australian farming community in terms of the markets both here and overseas. Can I also take the opportunity of acknowledging the hard-working group of fruit and vegetable growers and farmers that have come to Canberra to express some concerns nationally this week. I had the opportunity of meeting with a delegation of those yesterday led by Richard Bovill. We had a very frank and good discussion about issues that we as a nation confront and, of course, the government is doing its absolute best to address those issues, particularly regarding unfairness in the international marketplace.We confront that in a very energetic way with our strong advocacy to remove the high tariffs and heavy export subsidies that are being utilised and deployed by a lot of our competitors internationally. We are currently at the inner circle, if you like, of the negotiations in the Doha Round that are trying to get at these export subsidies and the limited access to markets. There is also a need for the high level of domestic support to be stripped away from a lot of our major competing countries to make a much fairer and leveller trading system across the world. We know it is unfair, we know it exists and we are doing an enormous amount to try and get rid of that. We are at that crucial stage in the multilateral negotiations to address those issues and they certainly will be of significant importance and support for Australian farmers.But we should also recognise what the government has been doing about negotiating FTAs with bilateral trading partners to try and improve access into some of our major markets whilst we are working on the Doha Round, whilst we are working on the multilateral system. We should also recognise that the Labor Party has opposed the government's moves on the bilateral front every inch of the way, instead wanting us to put all our energies into the multilateral negotiations. We agree on that point, we agree that we have got to keep on fighting the fight in removing export subsidies and domestic support in the markets of a lot of our competing countries, but we need to get results sooner than they are being delivered in the WTO, and that is why we embarked on our agenda of free trade agreement negotiations.The other things that we can do domestically this government has been doing extremely well, such as managing the economy, providing a stable economic environment - which is just as important to the farm sector as it is for every other sector of the economy - and we have been doing that since our time in office through good, sound economic management that has maintained downward pressure and stable, low interest rates in Australia. We have pushed unemployment down to the levels that have been announced today, the lowest levels in about 30 years. We are not sitting on our laurels on that front. We want to push that even further with the reforms that we are proposing. When we went through the whole process of taxation reform it was unambiguously aimed at making our exports more competitive. Almost $3 billion annually has been removed from the back of Australia's exports. And guess who collectively opposed that? The Australian Labor Party. We had to fight every inch of the way to deliver a benefit for Australian exporters. - We will continue on that train of thought, we will continue on that policy perspective of reform, and of course we have been able, through sound economic management in Australia, to afford to continue to deliver significant investment in infrastructure, particularly across regional Australia. So we aim to continue our hard fight in improving those elements of the international marketplace that militate against our farms in Australia; we aim to continue to eliminate and remove those export subsidies and those heavy levels of domestic support. Let us never forget that they exist today as a result of the negotiated outcomes of the Uruguay Round. And guess who was in government when that was concluded?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his character assessment of Mr Richard Marles. The government is committed to strengthening the country of origin labelling and making it mandatory to list the country from which the product originates. The honourable member will know that, as set out in the Constitution, the states and territories have responsibility for the food standards codes. As a result, the Commonwealth has one seat out of 10 at the table of FSANZ, which sets the country of origin requirements and labelling. Each of the six states and two territories as well as New Zealand hold the other seats and have equal say in the decisions of the council. So, if the Labor Party were truly supportive of accurate, distinctive and fair country of origin labelling, it would be urging its Labor health minister counterparts who make up eight out of the 10 votes to support the Commonwealth government. They should be supporting the Commonwealth government's proposed changes.But let us be clear not just about who largely has responsibility for determining country of origin labelling but about who has responsibility for enforcing it. This is a national disgrace. The Labor governments have sat on their collective hands and allowed obvious and identifiable breaches of the country of origin labelling to occur day in, day out, year in, year out. Quite frankly, they should be enforcing the country of origin labelling where it is in breach. There are many examples on our shelves where the products do not meet country of origin requirements. That is being ignored by the states and territories. So the Commonwealth is taking strong country of origin labelling requirements to the next ministerial council meeting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing today issued a statement outlining the Commonwealth's position. We look forward to the honourable member for Corio, for so long as he occupies that position, supporting the government, especially in our attempts to enlist the support of the Labor health ministers and Labor governments in enforcing the labelling.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon. Together with the honourable member for Braddon and many of my government colleagues, I attended the growers rally a short time ago. I was able to give them some very good news, unlike the rhetoric and cliches the Leader of the Opposition attempted to appease them with. It did not fool anybody. Some homespun story about some family connection to a citrus farm that no longer exists did not go down all that well, I can assure him. The growers want action. They are here in the gallery. They want to know what the government is to do for them.This is a vital industry to the nation. The growers, with their Fair Dinkum Food campaign, have won the support of many people throughout the community. They have raised the issue of consumer choice. The Fair Dinkum Food campaign has brought this issue starkly to the nation's attention. We have already made an initial investment of $200,000 to map out a way forward to support the growers beyond country of origin labelling reform and to go into what will make them more competitive against the threat of cheap importation. Consequently, today the coalition government announced an additional $3 million to support the future of the Australian -  -  - They would not welcome that, no. They would leave vegetable and citrus growers mired in the fight against imported competition. - The $3 million will provide business training, market development and leadership. It will strengthen industry relationships and supply chains and will accelerate priority research and development. The government is pulling together all strands of the sector to go forward, because when the euphoria dies down and the farmers are required to return to their properties to earn a living there are still going to be the issues of competitiveness, and that is where the government is going to work with the industry, in all of its complexities and diversity, to make our growers more price competitive.I would wish in conclusion to thank my parliamentary secretary, Senator Richard Colbeck, for his efforts in putting together this additional funding and negotiating it with a willing Treasurer and Prime Minister. Senator Colbeck is a strong champion and advocate for the growers of Tasmania. I would like especially also to single out the member for Braddon, who is all over this issue. He is one of them; he is from that community. The member for Braddon has been unrelenting in his representation - something in stark contrast to the Labor Party. You will never hear boo about this issue from the Labor Party. The Tasmanian representatives who occupy the opposition benches rarely if ever say anything about this issue. The member for Braddon has very strongly and fiercely represented his constituents. - In drawing to a conclusion, I will let the growers in the gallery and elsewhere make an assessment of who are the best friends that the vegetable industry ever had. It is the government - not Johnny-come-latelys like the member for Lyons, who is attempting to cover his tracks - and the member for Braddon and the member for Bass. It is the Tasmanian senators with the support of the government - a $3 million investment today.</DOC>

 - You are still trying, Joel. Keep trying, mate. You might get it all up next time. I have seen reports this morning of comments by the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Sol Trujillo, regarding the expansion of services to regional Australia. One thing I would commend him on is that at least he is prepared to talk about options in improving services to regional Australia, because the Australian Labor Party has no ideas on it and is putting no policy proposals forward at all. The question indicates that there is a requirement for that level of investment in regional services and we are obviously keen to talk to Telstra about the proposal that has been put forward. - Obviously the member for Hunter, as a semiregional and rural representative has not been following this debate. He certainly has not followed the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, because Estens spoke about services today, services in the future and the concept of future proofing. The concept of future proofing is being underpinned by a capital based fund. Providing a dividend stream to invest where the market fails in the future with future technology is a totally different and separate issue to what Telstra is talking about with a roll out of access to broadband to regional Australia today. They are two separate issues. The member for Hunter would be well advised to get some better advice on the issues that are confronting regional Australia today and into the future. The $2 billion Future Fund is about ensuring that market gaps do not appear because of market failure into the future. That is what the difference is. If the member for Hunter was right across this issue properly, he would well and truly understand that.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I know he will be interested, bearing in mind his own background in the Victoria Police, in these security issues. Our security agencies are assessing the footage of the video of 9 August and trying to establish its authenticity. At this stage that work is far from complete and there is still a good deal more work to be done. But I would like to take the opportunity of making this point. Any Australian who goes overseas and joins a terrorist organisation - for example, al-Qaeda - and fights with that organisation against Australia or our allies faces very serious consequences indeed. Groups like al-Qaeda are trained and prepared to kill and they are preparing to kill innocent civilians, including Australians. They constitute an enemy of Australia and they are the enemies of Australia's interests and our allies.If any Australian fighting for a terrorist organisation like al-Qaeda is captured in a war bearing arms on a battlefield, they face a tough legal situation. Such terrorists are not civilians within the meaning of the fourth Geneva convention; they are combatants. Nor are they prisoners of war under the third Geneva convention, because terrorist organisations, like al-Qaeda and others, are not legitimate international actors that obey the laws of war. As unlawful combatants, they lack the legal protection that prisoners of war would have. Under the Geneva convention, prisoners of war should be released at the end of a conflict. It is also, under the Geneva conventions, generally unlawful to put prisoners of war on trial. If people in these situations are captured, they face very severe difficulties. As we know, if they were captured by the United States, it is possible - it is not certain - that they could face the military commission process. But, if they were captured by other countries, there is no guarantee - and there is no requirement under international law either that they should face a process like that - the consequences could be significantly more severe in those circumstances.There is a simple principle here, and that is that these types of terrorists should not be able to return to the field of battle where they could once again take up arms against Australia or our allies. I make that point to emphasise that Australians who join terrorist organisations and wage war put themselves quite voluntarily beyond many of the protections that others would have under international law.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. Indeed there is a recent report released by the Business Council of Australia undertaken for them by Access Economics, one of the most well-known economic firms in this country, entitled Locking in or losing prosperity. Under the section headed 'How can we cement Australia's prosperity' it makes a number of recommendations including this one:... workplace relations reform (such as less heavy-handed employment regulation that allows employers to offer more flexible employment contracts).The report identified the benefits for the Australian economy over the next 20 years if further policies of economic reform are adopted. For example, Access Economics found that the economy will grow by four per cent rather than by 2.4 per cent, that Australia's economy would therefore be nearly 40 per cent bigger by 2025 than would have been the case without the reform and that the wealth - and this is important - of average Australians would be 25 per cent higher. In other words, average Australians would be $74,000 better off in today's dollars if further economic reform is undertaken in Australia, including reform to workplace relations. So this report clearly sets out the benefits of further economic reform to ordinary Australians. Yet on Tuesday we had in here the Leader of the Opposition arguing that there is no economic rationale for reform. Here are reams of reasons why there is economic rationale for this reform.We have seen the Leader of the Opposition basically roll over to the unions on workplace relations. This will mean lower living standards in the future for Australian families. For example, his policy to strangle Australian workplace agreements will leave hundreds of thousands of employees worse off in this country. The average wage for workers on Australian workplace agreements, if it were reduced to the average wage of those on collective agreements, would be $5,883 a year lower. They would be $5,883 a year worse off. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition to strangle Australian workplace agreements would rip off $113 a week from those workers who are on Australian workplace agreements. That is what the Leader of the Opposition's policy would do. We have the Leader of the Opposition asking us day after day and question after question to give some guarantees. Can I ask for a guarantee from the Leader of the Opposition? Can he give a guarantee -  - to the 12,000 workers in his electorate of Brand -  - who are on Australian workplace agreements that he is not going to rip off $113 a week? No, of course he cannot. Can the shadow opposition spokesman on industrial relations give a guarantee to the 7,000 workers in the electorate of Perth who are on AWAs that they are not going to be ripped off by $113 a week? The reality of this policy is that not only would it take Australia backwards, it would be detrimental to ordinary Australian workers and their families if ever enacted by the ALP.</DOC>

There is a consultation process under way at present. The honourable member has referred to some of the public meetings which yielded mixed results from participants. I can assure the honourable member that the commitment, which was based on the needs and requirements of growers, will indeed be honoured.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I want to say to start with that Australia is deeply disappointed that Iran has defied the International Atomic Energy Agency. It has broken the IAEA seals and restarted its uranium conversion facility at Isfahan. Iran had made commitments to suspend sensitive nuclear activities, including conversion, while negotiations on a long-term agreement continued with what are called the EU3 - the three European Union countries, Britain, France and Germany. With the EU3 proposal on the table, I believe those negotiations should continue. But the suspension must first be fully re-established.Australia does not believe Iran has any compelling need, operational or otherwise, to resume conversion or any other sensitive nuclear activity. Indeed, given its nuclear safeguards breaches and the fact that the IAEA is not in a position to conclude Iran has no undeclared nuclear activities, Iran needs to do more to build international community confidence that its nuclear activities are exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is not too late for Iran to turn back. My department has already told the Iranian ambassador, on 4 August, that we strongly encourage Iran to maintain the suspension, to examine the EU3 proposal carefully and to continue to negotiate with the EU3 in good faith. We reiterated that position at this week's special meeting of the IAEA board, of which we are a permanent member. We urged the international community to respond though, firmly and credibly, should Iran not reinstate its complete suspension. We anticipate the IAEA board will meet again this evening. Consideration and action by the IAEA board is the first of a possible range of options for the international community to deal with this serious issue, including a referral to the United Nations Security Council. Iran has a choice. It should not think that isolation from the international community and irresponsible behaviour is a path to national success. We hope it chooses wisely.</DOC>

Within two days of receiving them I had signed off on all grants and by this Friday all of the administration matters will be complete. It is this government that has doubled funding for ex-service organisations to enable their advocacy officers to assist veterans and their families to seek benefits. There has been no untoward delay in this. In fact, the organisations concerned have all been contacted in the last week by my office or by the appropriate federal members.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question, because obviously the London bombings have served as a stark reminder to us all of the terror and damage that can be wreaked on our society when terrorists target critical infrastructure. In this instance, we know that land transport infrastructure was targeted, but for some time the government has been aware and very much focused on protection of critical infrastructure generally - our energy, transport, food supply, finance and manufacturing sectors and our national icons and other essential utilities. That was reflected in the budget when an additional $50.2 million over four years was committed to programs designed to protect critical infrastructure.But it cannot be done alone. And I am pleased to say there is a willingness in business to work together with government in a genuine partnership on these issues. This will be demonstrated again tomorrow when business leaders will join with a number of ministers and me for the second Business-Government Advisory Group meeting in Canberra. This is a mechanism for the government to discuss proposed new security initiatives and developments and, as well, learn lessons from what has tragically happened in London. I obviously look forward to that meeting with CEOs and industry leaders and we will continue to work together to keep not only our economy strong but our people safe and secure from the threat of terrorism.There is another matter, Mr Speaker, that I know you and honourable members are very much aware of, and that is that I asked ASIO for advice on whether there were currently grounds in Australia for listing the organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir. ASIO has advised me that at present there is no basis under current legislation for specifying Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code. As I understand it, Hizb ut-Tahrir members overseas have called for attacks in the Middle East and Central Asia, but here in Australia it is not known to have - and I use these words deliberately - planned, assisted in or fostered any violent acts, which are the current legislative tests under the Criminal Code for proscription. At this stage the government is not aware of any information that Hizb ut-Tahrir is connected to the London bombings, as has been suggested elsewhere.The Criminal Code required that for a group to be specified as a terrorist organisation it must directly or indirectly engage in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. Under this act, in addition, there are separate offences for inciting a terrorist act. However, it remains of concern that some Hizb ut-Tahrir elements have called for attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and the United States and Israeli interests elsewhere. More generally, Hizb ut-Tahrir espouse a very extreme and radical agenda. I can confirm that my department is reviewing the proscription provisions contained in the Criminal Code and looking at some possible ways to strengthen those provisions. Until I receive that advice and have considered it, I am not prepared to comment on whether this group or any other may be listed in the future.</DOC>

 - There are some 300,000 veterans and war widows who are on the database of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Of those, there are a small number who for various reasons are no longer eligible for benefits - perhaps their assets have increased and hence they no longer receive a service pension. But they remain on our database because they are a veteran or a war widow and it may well be that their assets will fall in value and they will again become eligible for an entitlement. However, it is up to the family of those who may decease in that time to advise the department that they are no longer to be kept on the database. - Unfortunately, over a period of years some families have neglected to do that. The letter that was sent out regarding the medallions asked for advice about addresses and other matters. It is extremely regrettable that some families, through not removing their veteran or war widow family member from the database, received such a letter. - However, it is not a matter that could be avoided and, fortunately, it only happened in a very small number of cases.</DOC>

 - I certainly do agree with the member for Deakin that the government has made a good system even better. Since 1996 health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget. Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product. This year the federal portfolio of Health and Ageing will spend $44 billion. But it is not the quantity of the spending, it is the quality of the outcomes that counts, and that is attested to by the fact that all the state Labor premiers and chief ministers have unanimously agreed that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world. -  - He will wake up now, Mr Speaker! I have been asked about alternative policies. Labor's policy is to oppose every saving measure and to support every spending proposal. Every day the member for Lalor goes out and does a doorstop because she knows the Leader of the Opposition will almost never allow her to ask a question in this place. These doorstops are always shrill, they are usually personal and they are consistent only in their inconsistency. The member for Lalor has been talking for months about the need for sustainability in the PBS. Earlier this week it was revealed that the rate of growth of PBS spending had declined sharply. What did she do? She did not come out and say, 'That's great.' She said, 'The government has to investigate whether its policy of increasing copayments has put too big a burden on people needing medicine.' The increase in the copayment only happened because the opposition voted for it. Increasing the copayment was not -  - just government policy; it was opposition policy. What you cannot do is support a policy, criticise its consequences and claim any shred whatsoever of economic credibility.Let me remind the member for Lalor that constant calls for reform are not a health policy. Accusing people of being liars is not a health policy. Continuing to support Medicare Gold is not a health policy, given that the President of the ALP calls it a 'turkey'. What we have in the opposition is a Leader of the Opposition who never even mentions health and the member for Lalor and spokesman for health who is not allowed to ask questions about it in this parliament. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia have concluded that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had?</DOC>

I advised the RSL in Melbourne some four to five weeks prior to their congress that due to commitments in my electorate I would be unable to attend. However, I have attended every other RSL conference held in every state, and I am intending to attend the RSL national congress in Hobart. Can I say that I take every opportunity to share in ex-service organisations' commemorations and all of their meetings. I notice, though, that there are not always others present at the meetings that I have been at.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for the work that he did on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration when his committee took the semi-annual testimony from the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Melbourne on Friday. I think the honourable member will agree with me that the outlook which was presented by the Reserve Bank governor was pretty up-beat. He noticed that consumer demand had slowed and there was a consolidation of household balance sheets going on but also that the economy was showing good growth, particularly in employment and investment. In quite colourful language, the Governor of the Reserve Bank described the low-inflation outlook for the Australian economy as 'nirvana' - a more colourful word than I would use or the government would use. They were the words of the Reserve Bank governor. He also said in his testimony:This is a pretty comfortable position in which to be. We are not expecting to change monetary policy in the near term, and when we look further into the future we no longer see a clear probability of it moving in one direction rather than the other.So that is a pretty stable outlook, and I have always said that if we keep inflation low in Australia we can keep interest rates low. That optimistic testimony from the Reserve Bank governor no doubt comes as a severe shock to the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, who in extraordinary scenes in April, expecting an interest rate rise, wired himself into a TV studio so he could give a live commentary on what he expected would be an interest rate rise. I have seen a lot of shadow Treasurers but I have never seen one so opportunistic as to get into a studio at 9.30 on the day after the Reserve Bank board meeting so that he could weep crocodile tears about an interest rate rise that he was expecting. He was severely embarrassed when interest rates did not rise that day and, instead of being glad for millions of Australians, he attacked the central bank for not raising interest rates. He said:They barked a lot but they only bit once, so it's very hard for them to be taken seriously now.That is what Labor understands by an independent central bank. He went on:You don't go barking for months like they did and then just give a nibble.We have seen some opportunists come and go as shadow Treasurer, but we have never seen one of the dimension of the member for Lilley. He no doubt was disappointed by the testimony which was given by the central bank governor in Melbourne last Friday, but millions of Australians will not be because they know that low inflation means low interest rates. Under this government they have had a chance on their mortgages, they have had a chance with their jobs and good economic management will keep on coming.</DOC>

 - I can say this: it is not the greatest risk to interest rates in Australia. The greatest risk to interest rates in Australia would be you becoming Treasurer of this country. I can think of millions of Australians falling into threat, but you getting into government would be the greatest threat to the wellbeing of millions of Australians. So, having relieved ourselves of that threat in the near future, we will go on and we will talk about Telstra.I say to the member for Lilley, who apparently is now apprised of what the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has recommended to the cabinet - I must say, it comes as news to me, but then again the member for Lilley no doubt has inserted his little listening devices in the cabinet room and he knows what is going on - in relation to Telstra that it is certainly the view of the government and I think of most analysts that the ownership of Telstra has to be resolved. It can be either fully nationalised or fully privatised. I do not believe there is anybody in Australia that believes that it should be fully nationalised; therefore, its status can only be resolved in one way.Can I also make it clear that this government believe that the proceeds of the sale of a capital asset should be invested for future generations. That is what we have always done in relation to retiring debt. In relation to retiring debt, have a look at the record. The record is this: when this government were elected Commonwealth net debt was $96 billion. By the end of the last financial year we had relieved future Australian generations of $80 billion of Labor debt. If you reduce debt by $80 billion -  - Let me take that interjection. The member for Melbourne said, 'Anybody can reduce debt by selling an asset.' That is what he said. The Labor Party sold off Qantas and increased debt in the same year. The Labor Party sold off the Commonwealth Bank and increased debt in the same year. - The point I was making was that this government has believed that when you sell a capital asset you should replace it with further assets or retire debt, and the point I made is that the Australian Labor Party not only sold a capital asset and spent the proceeds in one year but increased debt simultaneously. That is a trifecta.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As he knows, a number of his own constituents have been beneficiaries of the free trade agreements that have been negotiated with Thailand and Singapore - a policy perspective, I suppose it is fair enough to say, that has been opposed all the way by the Australian Labor Party. Nonetheless, it is an indication of our government getting on with the job of improving the circumstances for Australians and providing more opportunities both at home and abroad for the Australian business community.The Thai and Singapore FTAs are delivering real benefits to Australian exporters, particularly those in the electorate of Hinkler. The Singapore free trade agreement entered into force two years ago and since then Austrade has assisted 454 companies enter into the market, and over half of those were actually new exporters entering the Singaporean market for the first time. That effort has delivered an extra $320 million worth of additional exports, just into that market alone, as a result of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.As far as Thailand is concerned - and of course the Thai FTA has not been going for a full 12 months - Australia's merchandise exports to Thailand have grown 40 per cent since 1 January this year when the FTA came into force. Total two-way trade with Thailand is now over $8 billion, which is quite significant. The areas of improvement with Thailand include a 43 per cent increase in the export of wine, a 19 per cent increase of pharmaceutical products, a 25 per cent increase in aluminium and a 62 per cent increase in fresh fruit and nut products going into the Thai market. So the point here is that the exercise of negotiating bilateral free trade agreements is absolutely imperative to our effort to see economic growth across Australia as far as our exporters are concerned.The company in the electorate of the member for Hinkler that has done extremely well out of these negotiated outcomes is a company called Austchilli that exports chilli products and food additives across the world. They have taken advantage of these agreements in exporting product into Singapore - not to mention another company, in Western Australia in the electorate of Canning. I am sure the member for Canning would recognise a company called Edwards Hot Water from Canning. They are now exporting hot water systems into Thailand.So there are primary products but also manufactured goods going out of Australia into these markets, sustaining Australian jobs in the Australian economy - jobs that we want to see sustained for many years into the future. We have embarked upon a serious reform program over the years, including targeting bilateral free trade agreements to enhance opportunities for Australian businesses so they can generate more employment in the Australian economy. The reforms that we propose today, particularly the industrial relations reforms, are targeted and aimed at doing exactly the same things as far as the work force in Australia is concerned.</DOC>

 - Under the Trade Practices Act people can bargain collectively as long as they give notification; otherwise, it would be construed as anticompetitive conduct. The government has put in place procedures which will make it easier to engage in collective negotiation of small business even though, prima facie, it is considered anticompetitive conduct under the Trade Practices Act.But the government does not propose to allow the Trade Practices Act to become a vehicle for trade unionism. The Trade Practices Act is a vehicle which regulates economic relations. It is the Industrial Relations Act that regulates trade unionism and it is under the Industrial Relations Act that trade unions register and get members. I have never seen a trade union yet have itself registered under the Trade Practices Act and get legal personality, corporate status, the rules approved and its elections conducted under the Trade Practices Act. That is done under the Industrial Relations Act. That will not be changing under the new system. The Trade Practices Act will continue to regulate economic activity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I am not surprised he is interested as he was part of the parliamentary delegation that visited Aceh in June. I appreciate the insights he has brought back and I know his constituents appreciate his interest as well. The government warmly welcomes the signing of the historic agreement to end hostilities between the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement, known as GAM. That agreement was signed in Helsinki.This is a tragic conflict which has lasted for over three decades and it has brought enormous suffering to the people of Aceh and more broadly to Indonesia. It is estimated that there have been something like 15,000 people killed as a result of this conflict. This is a peace agreement that offers a real opportunity for lasting peace for the people of Aceh who, after all, are still rebuilding their lives after the devastating tsunami of Boxing Day last year. I can only congratulate both sides on this achievement.When Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became the President of Indonesia he said, amongst other things, probably to the Prime Minister but also to me and to others, that he wanted to resolve the Aceh problem peacefully. He did not want to use military means to resolve it. This agreement is an enormous tribute to President Yudhoyono and to his team. They have done an extraordinarily good job in the most difficult of circumstances. I do not detract from the credit that must be given to the Free Aceh Movement as well. They deserve credit from their perspective. I think President Yudhoyono has done a great thing here, and we very much hope that this peace agreement will stick and that both sides will fulfil their obligations under the agreement.It is significant that, as I have mentioned already, it is in Aceh itself where reconstruction is taking place. The fact of peace breaking out in Aceh will obviously facilitate the reconstruction work post tsunami. We have already allocated an initial $50 million rehabilitation package to Aceh as part of our $1 billion, five-year funding under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. This will make it all the easier to help rebuild Aceh.In conclusion, there is to be an Aceh monitoring mission. It will be of about 200 to 250 personnel. They will be from the European Union and ASEAN. They will do a good job overseeing the implementation of this agreement and we will always be happy to provide logistical assistance to that peace monitoring team should they require any logistical assistance from Australia.</DOC>

 - The government will be proceeding with the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. The main reason we are proceeding with those amendments is that they enhance the bargaining capacity of small business. That is the reason we are going to proceed with them. As the Treasurer correctly said, he is not aware, and I am not aware, of a union that has ever sought registration under the Trade Practices Act or sought to have its rules and the conduct of its affairs governed by the Trade Practices Act. The Leader of the Opposition knows that this is a ridiculous proposition, but of course maintaining the position that he does is entirely consistent with the cherry-picking approach the Labor Party has always adopted to the rights of trade unions under the law of Australia. This House will remember that for years and years the Labor Party argued that the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, which regulated commercial conduct, should be taken out of the Trade Practices Act and put into the Industrial Relations Act. Why? Because those provisions would be ineffective as part of the Industrial Relations Act.The proposition of the Leader of the Opposition is not one to advance the interests of small business. Small business will be advantaged by our amendment, just as small business will be advantaged by the changes we propose to the Workplace Relations Act and just as small business has been advantaged by the reductions in interest rates. I will wager that every person to whom the Leader of the Opposition has spoken today has been a beneficiary of the enhanced economic conditions of the last 9½ years. If those conditions are to be maintained and strengthened in the future, instead of opposing what the government is doing, the Leader of the Opposition should be getting behind not only the amendments to the Trade Practices Act but also the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question and his interest in this subject. I can inform him and the House that, under the new workplace relations system, workers will continue to be protected against inappropriate conduct by employers. For example, it will continue to be unlawful to dismiss or to victimise an employee for refusing to agree to a new workplace agreement. The Office of the Employment Advocate will continue to provide a strong inspection service and, indeed, in 2003-04 the Office of Workplace Services concluded more than 4,700 investigations into breaches of federal industrial laws.Under our proposals, it will continue to be unlawful for employees to be dismissed for refusing to sign an AWA, for example. This will not change. It will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a person taking temporary absence from work due to illness or disability. It will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a worker who is absent from work because of their family responsibilities. And it will continue to be unlawful to dismiss a worker in relation to the filing of a complaint or participating in proceedings against an employer involved in an alleged violation of laws or regulations. None of these things will change under these proposals.I see that the ACTU has put out another booklet setting out some scenarios. What it fails to point out is that these scenarios, even if they are true, are unlawful under the current provisions and will remain unlawful in the future. What we see from the ACTU is a campaign in which it is happier to exploit and manipulate workers than to actually tell them the truth. The depth of this campaign was revealed last Wednesday evening on the Lateline program when the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, was filmed at an ACTU campaign meeting in which she is recorded on film as saying:I need a mum or a dad of someone who's been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.That is an absolute disgrace. It is deeply offensive to all decent Australians that the President of the ACTU would be saying on film at a campaign meeting that what it needs is the parent of a dead or injured worker in order to continue its politically motivated campaign. That is shocking. It is a disgrace. The President of the ACTU had a chance this morning on radio in Adelaide, on the Leon Byner program, to retract that disgraceful statement and she said, 'I make no apology for that.'This is a statement for which there is no defence. There is no defence for saying, 'We should run a political campaign off the back of a seriously injured or dead worker in Australia.' Yet that is what the ACTU is saying. It is disgraceful. The former presidents of the ACTU are in here - the member for Throsby, the member for Batman, the member for Hotham. I do not believe that they would have said something like that. I invite them to get on the phone this afternoon and ask Sharan Burrow to retract this disgraceful statement. This is offensive - deeply offensive. It ought to be retracted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. I am very shocked to think that the Australian Labor Party, the alternative government in this place, would want to talk down those who have come to Australia with skills that we need in our economy. In fact, to try to defeat the notion that migration is somehow something less than a nation-building exercise invites a very simple observation.When the Labor Party was last in power, 60 per cent of the people arriving in this country went on welfare. Under this government, over 60 per cent of people arriving in this country under a migration program that is focusing on Australia's interests and on Australia's terms and conditions are going into jobs. This government has delivered higher levels of apprentices in training. This government has delivered higher levels of people taking on training and higher levels of people completing training. We have put all of that in place. At the same time, we know that in order to gear up Australia for the future we will have new innovation and new opportunity that we will present to the generations to come.If the Labor Party really cared about getting people into training they would do a couple of things. First, they would stand against the TAFE fee increases that the states have presided over - and they will instantly take a point order because they know I am right. - The question is also about the 100,000 or more who did not get a start in TAFE because the fees went up. Over 100,000 people walked away from TAFE opportunities because the states put fees up. The question is also about the 143,000 people who are being offered an opportunity under the new national training agreement, which the Labor states have yet to sign up to -  - If the member for Jagajaga were really concerned about more training opportunities for Australians she would urge the union leadership in each of the various states and territories to get on the phone to their state education and training minister and urge them to sign up to the new national training agreement which will instantly deliver over 140,000 extra training places for Australians - and they can do it now. But in doing so, in trying to establish her case, the member for Jagajaga is talking down the contributions of migration to Australia's economy. She should be ashamed. This sort of xenophobic, picking on the minority, approach from those opposite places them, in the minds of average Australians, in every possible way, as being ill-suited to ever taking over on this side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth and acknowledge the great interest he has in the Middle East. I appreciate his interest in asking this question. Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement initiative is, I think, a very positive step taken by him and the Israeli government towards bringing about the goals of the road map for the Middle East, which our government strongly supports. I want to make this point because I do not think it is made often enough. Prime Minister Sharon deserves enormous credit for the courage he has shown in taking this extraordinarily difficult and sensitive step. I would also like to acknowledge the professionalism of the Israeli defence forces in carrying out this decision, because it has obviously been very sensitive as well. I think that so far they have handled it very well. We would encourage Israel to continue to maintain their efforts.Likewise, I welcome Palestinian President Abbas's commitment to stopping terrorism and incitement to further bloodshed in the context of the disengagement. It is obviously important that the Palestinian authority is firmly able to control law and order and to ensure that this process of disengagement is not in any way disrupted by terrorists. I would urge all Palestinians not to waste this opportunity that has been provided. I hope that both sides can now build constructively on the momentum of disengagement.The honourable member for Wentworth asked what Australia was doing about it. We announced a week or so ago a tangible contribution to the disengagement process with the secondment of an Army officer to the international Security Sector Working Group. I have also been talking with Jim Wolfensohn - who, honourable members will recall, was the Australian President of the World Bank; he is now the quartet's Special Envoy for Disengagement - on ways that Australia can make a significant contribution through our aid budget to making sure that disengagement works. We have been discussing particular projects to assist the Palestinians in the context of disengagement - particularly to assist Palestinians obtain work and to develop business opportunities.I really do want to emphasise the admiration we in this government have for the decision that Prime Minister Sharon and the Israeli government have taken to make this big step of disengagement. It is difficult. It has been politically very challenging for them to do it. Ministers and parliamentary supporters and campaign workers have been politically lost during this process, but Prime Minister Sharon has stuck with it and he deserves great credit for it.</DOC>

 - Once again, the Labor Party are showing how little they understand the importance of Regional Partnerships in the community. They have mounted a politically motivated attack on a very important program which is providing tremendous support to communities throughout Australia. The decision taken by me was consistent with the Regional Partnerships guidelines. However, as is allowed under the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocations guidelines, the normal exclusions for the prospectus were waived because of the significant potential national benefit of the project.The Labor Party laugh and joke about this project. I remind the Labor Party that, in a letter sent to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, on 14 February 2005, Ian Kiernan AO, the Chairman of Primary Energy, reminded the Leader of the Opposition of the benefits of this project. They included the project's capital expenditure of $100 million, annual operation expenditure of $81 million, expansion of the local economy base of $170 million, generation of an additional $30 million in household income per year, farmer sustainability, additional grain markets, $47 million in export income, $88 million in domestic revenue and, most importantly, 40 permanent jobs, 500 construction positions, 350 permanent employment positions - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I can advise the House that, so far, the government has spent some $160 million to prepare our country against this potential threat. There are 21 thermal imaging screeners that could be deployed to airports within hours of a possible human pandemic outbreak. The government is stockpiling 40 million surgical masks, 50 million syringes and 303 ventilators. There are six quarantine centres prepared to deal with some 500 people each. On a per capita basis we have the world's largest stockpile of antivirals after Finland. Also, the government is upgrading the World Health Organisation collaborating influenza laboratory in Melbourne and, most recently, the government has committed almost $5 million to ensure that a candidate vaccine against pandemic flu starts trials next month. That is the latest advice I have from CSL. In addition, a live exercise to test our pandemic preparedness will take place in November. We cannot tell if, or when, there will be a pandemic flu outbreak but, according to the World Health Organisation, Australia is as well prepared as any other country to meet this potential public health disaster.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and his obvious interest in the business and community associations in his electorate that understand the significance of the availability and the affordability of insurance. Members of the House will only too well remember the collapse of HIH and the fact that the federal government committed some $640 million to the HIH Claims Support Scheme to ensure that insurance would be available to businesses and community groups at that most challenging time.I congratulate the states for working with the leadership of the federal government at the time to ensure the tort law reform that came in. I report to the House today that the ACCC and APRA surveys, two independent surveys, have now confirmed that the downward pressure that we were trying to achieve on premiums has been achieved with up to a 4.8 per cent reduction in public liability and professional indemnity insurance premiums. That is good news for Australian businesses. But unfortunately there are still some real impediments to the affordability of business insurance, public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance: Labor state and territory governments.In New South Wales metropolitan areas, for every $100 that a business pays in business insurance premiums, an extra $37 goes to the state in the form of taxation. In metropolitan Victoria, for every $100, an extra $38 goes to the state Labor government in taxes. But in regional Victoria - and I do not know how any business can survive there - they are hit with a massive 82 per cent. For every $100 of premium paid, there is an extra $82 in state taxes collected by the Victorian government in the form of the fire services levy, GST and stamp duty - 82 per cent. So, on one hand, whilst the Labor governments have worked well to bring down tort law reform and that is having downward pressure overall on premiums, on the other hand, the state Labor governments continue to charge these exorbitant taxes and taxes on taxes to our business community stymieing the growth of business. I have one example here from a small delicatessen in regional Victoria - no doubt a mum and dad operation - whose premium was $2,191 but, when you add state Labor taxes, it jumps to $3,158. - The Leader of the Opposition says that it is GST. It is in fact the fire services levy and stamp duty. The study of the Insurance Council of Australia indicates that over the last five years state Labor governments have increased their take of state taxes on insurance premiums by 51 per cent. They are now collecting $3.2 billion - money that could be well spent on creating more jobs in regional Victoria, in metropolitan New South Wales and throughout Australia. The Labor Party not only stands for higher taxes but delivers higher taxes.</DOC>

 - Where a project is considered under Regional Partnerships and is located in a minister's electorate, it is normal practice for another minister in the portfolio to act as the decision maker for that project, which is of course quite proper to do. In accordance with this established procedure, Minister Campbell, at that time, was the decision maker on Primary Energy. Minister Campbell, in his then role as the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, asked the department to progress the application. I signed off on this project on 27 July 2004. Again, I remind the House of the importance of this project to that community and the importance of Regional Partnerships to communities around Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I appreciate how serious this problem is in the Northern Territory and in other remote Indigenous communities around Australia. I regret to tell the House that the advice I have is that petrol sniffing has claimed some 100 lives over the last couple of decades. Under a scheme operating since 1998, the government is supplying unsniffable petrol to some 42 remote Indigenous communities. In the recent budget the government committed a further $9 million to supply unsniffable petrol to another 23 remote Indigenous communities, and the government is currently talking to the Northern Territory government about a possible further extension of the scheme to include a wide area of Central Australia.This government certainly will not leave vulnerable communities to cope on their own. As people like Noel Pearson have recognised, in the end benevolent government is not capable of solving all the problems of these communities. Some communities such as Yuendumu have successfully tackled this problem by quite literally taking sniffers by the scruff of the neck and sending them to rehabilitation at outstations such as Mount Theo. While I appreciate that what works in one place does not necessarily work elsewhere, I do commend the example of self-help at Yuendumu to all Indigenous communities that are afflicted by this terrible problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. Since 1996 there has been a 100 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices in training in the electorate of Blair. That is an additional 860 people who have had an opportunity not just simply to build the skills they need for today but also to become the leaders of tomorrow. On that theme, I want to acknowledge that Group Training Australia has today, as part of a three-day leadership course, here in the gallery 21 superior apprentices from the Australian work force who will become the leaders of tomorrow. Apprentices, as you know, are not simply creating opportunities for themselves; they go on to become employers themselves and give opportunities to the next lot of people who come along. That is something the member for Brand forgot when he was the minister in charge. We actually saw the record drop for people in training in those days. We are still paying the price for that. After question time, these 21 apprentices will be meeting with the Prime Minister, which is terrific.In answer to the member for Blair's question, each year the publicly funded training system in this country trains 1.7 million Australians, an increase of half a million since 1995. Over the next four years there will be $10.1 billion of Australian government investment. Leadership that we are providing at the national level, to try and coerce and encourage the state governments to realise their national obligations as well as their state imperatives, is absolutely critical.As part of our new support for apprentices in 2005-06 we are spending $587.1 million on a number of new initiatives. That will help to ease the financial burden for apprentices and their employers. The Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarships - two payments of $500 for eligible new apprentices in skills needs trades - will assist around 90,000 new apprentices in the first two years alone. There is a new payment of $25 per week for the third-year apprentices who have moved away from their family homes. That will benefit about 3,000 annually. That will mainly help people from rural and regional areas. It will bring, too, some 7,600 people who are benefiting under that approach, for the first, second and third years of their apprenticeships. As well, all employers who have made a significant contribution to a new apprentice's training will share in the $2,750 completion initiative recognising the commitment of employers who have provided 25 per cent or more of a new apprentice's training.Of course from 1 October we will start to see first year apprentices being able to gain access to the $800 tool kit allowance. That is a very popular initiative, let me tell you. With the extension of entitlements to Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy to new apprentices, as many as 93,000 will benefit over three years. This government know that the economy is strong today. This government know that the training of apprentices is at record levels today, but we are not taking any of it for granted. We are looking at the years of the future and know that the investments we make today will build a long-term sustainable platform for the Australian economy. It is good for the individuals involved; it is great for Australia.</DOC>

 - I am happy to sing the praises of Work for the Dole. In response to the member for Canning, when we came to government in 1996, under Labor unemployment had been at 9.1 per cent in the electorate of Canning. Today it is at six per cent, so congratulations to the member for Canning and congratulations to the Howard government for putting in place programs which reduce unemployment. We also know that, since 1997, 352,000 Australians have been helped through the Work for the Dole program. Many of them have gone on to work and many of them have benefited from a program that has helped them to understand work experience, working in a team environment and giving back to the community. We know that it has been a wonderful program. -  - There are always lots of interjections when we talk about Work for the Dole. So far there have been 334 occasions that members opposite have interjected and said that Work for the Dole is not a good program. I do not understand why the Labor Party hates Work for the Dole. It is very difficult to understand. What we need from Labor is a champion of Work for the Dole. Last week the member for Franklin had some sensible comments to make, so I call on him today: if he is interested in advancing the cause of the Labor Party, he should tell his leader and his colleagues to get behind Work for the Dole because it is a great program.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I can inform him that the labour price index for the June quarter of this year showed a slight acceleration of wage costs, rising four per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2005, which was marginally up from the 3.9 per cent through the year to the March quarter of 2005. These wage costs show that there are real wage increases going on in the community but they are restrained and consistent with low inflation, provided the economy maintains productivity growth. Indeed, the Reserve Bank governor, in his testimony last Friday, noting that the wage cost index was 3.9 per cent, described it as 'remarkably well behaved'.The member for Corangamite also asked about measures to improve labour market outcomes. I know that this is of real interest to him because he asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank questions to this effect in Melbourne on Friday. The governor was asked why Europe was showing slow economic growth compared to Australia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said:I think the biggest single explanation is that they have very old-fashioned, heavily overregulated economies.               _              _              _One of the forms of heavy regulation in Europe is labour market regulation. It is extraordinarily heavy labour market regulation, most of which has the effect - as a lot of regulations do - of protecting the insiders at the expense of the outsiders. So the people in the jobs are very heavily protected, while people trying to get in find it very difficult. That is why they are all running 10 per cent unemployment.The Reserve Bank governor's view that heavy labour market regulation leads to higher unemployment is not his alone; it is also the view of the IMF, the OECD and this government. It is not the view of the Australian Labor Party, who believe that they know more than the OECD, the IMF or the Reserve Bank governor. The Australian Labor Party believe that 'the lemon has been squeezed dry', to use the phrase of the Leader of the Opposition, and that you cannot do any more with labour market improvement. They have given up on creating more jobs and they have given up on having a stronger economy here in Australia. If you want to get outcomes, you have to engage in reform. It is not enough to sit there and prattle on, as the Leader of the Opposition does, and give the game away. Labour market reform in this country will create more jobs, more opportunities and better wages for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I can guarantee is that the government will continue, as we have done over the last nine years, to deliver good services to Australia. We have already delivered over $1 billion in telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. What the government have announced today is a plan to continue to invest billions and billions of dollars in telecommunications services in Australia - in particular, regional Australia - so that we can structure a mechanism that will give certainty and security, not just on the funding of services but also on competition and consumer protection into the future. The package announced today strengthens some of the fundamentals that we, not the Labor Party, put in place. The Labor Party did not put in place the universal service obligation. The Labor Party did not put in place the customer service guarantee. We are going to strengthen those things as part of this package to ensure that telecommunications services are delivered equitably across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. He represents a large part of Western Australia, and a lot of rural exports go out of his electorate. The most important thing we can do is to continue to maintain the competitive edge of Australia's producers and exporters right across the nation, whether they be in the cities or in regional Australia. In regional Australia, which is where the member for O'Connor comes from, despite ongoing drought in some areas, our farmers have been making an enormous contribution to Australia's export effort. Remember that over the last 12 months Australia has exported $162.3 billion worth of goods and services. That is a record as far as Australia is concerned. In 1995-96, it was $99 billion, and it has gone up to $162.3 billion. Out of interest, the Australian beef industry has contributed $4.8 billion in exports, thanks to the 70,000 Aussie beef farmers, some of them in the member for O'Connor's electorate. The Australian lamb industry has contributed $1.2 billion to that effort, thanks to the 38,400 lamb producers across Australia, a lot of them from Western Australia. That is a very important contribution.The government are working on a number of fronts to help Australian farmers to export their products and to improve their competitive edge. Obviously, we need to maintain our focus on opening up markets across the world. We also need to maintain our focus on a competitive and efficient environment in Australia, and that includes the telecommunications system across regional Australia. The government's investment in telecommunications in the past, and what we have proposed today for the future, will continue to help Australia's exporters to remain globally competitive. A critically important element of this debate is that, under the announcements made by the government today, services will be delivered and guaranteed into the future. Fundamental reforms are needed, and will be delivered, to fund new infrastructure, encourage competition and safeguard services - all important elements of the package.We are not resting on our laurels. We are not in a policy vacuum, unlike those on the other side of politics. All the ideas for reform and improvement are coming from this side of the House. We will continue to deliver good policy, sound economic management and strategic investment in essential infrastructure so that we can maintain the competitive edge for Australian industry and Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform the honourable member for Dobell that the proceeds of privatisation which have been received under the administration of this government have been used to retire Labor Party debt - that is, the capital sum has been offset by a reduction in capital liability. When this government was elected the Commonwealth debt was $96 billion. By the end of the financial year just past, this government had reduced Commonwealth debt in net terms by $80 billion.There is no difference between the government and the opposition on privatisation policy. Just to prove the point, I will table the Canberra Times of 25 August 1994, which has this headline: 'Privatisation vital: Beazley' The article says:The Minister for Finance, Kim Beazley, made a spirited defence of privatisation in his address to the National Press Club yesterday.The Labor Party do not actually oppose privatisation. In fact, they used to give spirited defences of the practice. But there is a big difference between the privatisation practised by the Labor Party and that practised by this government. When the Labor Party engaged in privatisation - and I was reminded of this by the member for Melbourne yesterday - they spent the entire proceeds in the year of receipt.Let me give you an example. In October 1993, under Labor the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank was sold off for $1.7 billion. The Australian Labor Party government spent the full $1.7 billion in October 1993 and then, after they had spent the full $1.7 billion, borrowed another $15 billion to actually finance their budget. Let me give you another example. In July 1995 the Australian Labor Party government privatised Qantas and received $1.5 billion. In the year of receipt, which was 1995-96, they spent the lot so that by the end of the financial year they had no shares and no proceeds and, after spending the lot, borrowed another $12.3 billion to finance their budget.In relation to all of the privatisation conducted by the Australian Labor Party, they sold the shares, spent the money, ran the budget in deficit and borrowed to fund it as a consequence. There is not one dollar in either asset or reduced debt to show for Labor Party privatisation. In fact, during those privatisations net debt ran up to $96 billion. This government has a very different view. This government has always applied the proceeds of privatisation to the reduction of debt. Net debt, as I said, has been reduced under this government by $80 billion. With the proceeds of the privatisation of Telstra, this Commonwealth government will become debt free in net terms. What a legacy that will be for future generations - not paying back Labor's debt but building a financial position.</DOC>

 - The first point I would make is that nobody is obliged to buy shares in a privatisation. It is a voluntary activity. If you are making a financial decision, I would say to people to make their own decisions accordingly. The second point I would make is that if you had bought in the first tranche of Telstra you would have not only a capital appreciation but also dividends - in fact, franked dividends. - What he did not take into account is that it was not only a high dividend stock, because he did not actually disclose that, but a franked dividend stock - that is, you do not have to pay tax on the franking credits that you receive in relation to your dividends. I would say to people that when the prospectus is issued - and I will not be giving financial information when the prospectus is issued - they should consider their financial position and get advice. If it is a good, long-term investment, I have no doubt that millions of Australians will participate, as they did in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and note his ongoing interest in the role of small businesses in the Latrobe Valley in towns like Warragul and Drouin in creating jobs. Just this week, Australian Business Ltd released a survey of 900 employers which revealed that one-third of the respondents had paid go-away money to get rid of an unfair dismissal claim or knew someone who had. - There have been over 90,000 unfair dismissal applications filed since the system was introduced in 1994, and that does not include those cases where employers have paid go-away money to get rid of the claim. I heard the member for Hunter interjecting earlier. I was interested to read in the Australian yesterday that the member for Hunter said that he was not surprised by this finding from the Australian Business Ltd survey. Of course, we are reminded of what the member for Hunter said in 1998. In 1998 the member for Hunter said on the Small Business Show that unfair dismissal laws cost jobs. He said:Well my wife consistently tells me she could afford to put on one more person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation.That is from the member for Hunter, whose wife has been telling him what a problem these unfair dismissal laws are. The ALP knows this, because just recently the Leader of the Opposition said:The problem that they confront, is when you get a bloke, or a person who is an employee, who's a con artist, a rorter, who knows that if you can get the small businessman to shut his shop for a couple of days, drag him down to the IRC, put him through the mill it'll be worth ten grand for him to send you away.Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition saying that this is a rort and that, if you can get a small businessman to shut up his shop and go down to the IRC, he will pay 10 grand to get rid of the problem.What these comments from the member for Hunter and the Leader of the Opposition demonstrate is that the Australian Labor Party know that this is bad policy. Yet, knowing that this is bad policy, the Australian Labor Party have voted against this on 41 separate occasions. On one hand they purport to be concerned for small business but, when given the opportunity to actually do something for small business, they will not do it. We will do it. We will do it because this will enable small businesses to employ more Australians.</DOC>

 - Of course the government is not a distressed seller. The government does not sell Telstra because it needs money. It is not like the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party sold assets, spent the money and still had to borrow to cover a budget deficit. This is a government - and this is a very important point - that has the budget in surplus. It has net debt which will be totally eliminated and therefore it is not a distressed seller. So that puts the government, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, in a strong position. It puts the government in a position where it can choose to offer the Telstra shares at a time which will maximise benefits for taxpayers and give a decent investment for private investors. These are matters which will be the subject of commercial judgment. They will be made at an appropriate time, and they will be done in a way in which the government can do it without being rushed into a particular timetable. That is what happens when you have a strong balance sheet. That is what happens when you have good economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar. I know that she, for one, is a very strong supporter of the evolution of democracy in Iraq, even if not every member of this House is. I think it is well understood by the House that the people of Iraq are working on putting together a constitution which reflects the general wishes of the people of that country. They have made good progress, although I note that the National Assembly of Iraq, which is a democratically elected body, voted on Monday to give a week's extension to these negotiations.There has been a constructive outreach process which has been supported by the United Nations in putting a constitution together. Indeed, honourable members might be interested to know that a quarter of a million Iraqis have joined in meetings to help draft the constitution, so it has been a very open and inclusive process. There are now around 550 voter registration centres enrolling voters for a constitutional referendum which is scheduled to be on 15 October. If that takes place, that will be another act of democracy which will come on top of the 8½ million people who went out to vote on 30 January.I know the situation in Iraq is still difficult - no-one has any illusions about that - but I also know one thing about our approach to this, and that is that we are champions of democracy. We are on the side of democracy and we want to see the evolution of democratic institutions in Iraq. That is what we want to see. I think that slowly but surely Iraq is heading in that direction.Let me just say in conclusion that some people, such as the Leader of the Opposition - and I was asked about alternative views - think that the international community should set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq of military forces. I think that is the wrong policy. I think that is a policy which is wrong-headed. I think the right policy is to set benchmarks to make sure that we achieve certain objectives and, when those objectives have been achieved, we should, of course, be able to withdraw. That is what many people have said. We hope that the time when those benchmarks, such as the training of the Iraqi defence forces, will all have been achieved will be sooner rather than later, but we will wait to see. - The Leader of the Opposition constantly interjects. On this issue, he is profoundly - and I say there is one word that sums up his approach - weak. That is what you are - weak. There are 20 million people out there who know it. The member for Griffith, by the way, I think has some sympathy for our view, and that was revealed in Bernard Lagan's book. That book has not had much of a run but it is a good book. On 25 May 2004 the member for Griffith said: 'When we took the decision about troop withdrawal by the end of the year, we took it because we felt it was the right thing to do.' The member for Griffith said that they took the decision because it was 'the right thing to do'. That is what he told the Australian public. But Bernard Lagan revealed that Rudd 'desperately wanted to persuade the Labor leader not to set a Christmas deadline,' and, when he did, 'Rudd was infuriated.' The member for Griffith said one thing to the Australian public, but behind the scenes he was pursuing a completely different policy. What are we left with? We are left with the shambles of a policy on Iraq by a Leader of the Opposition whose greatest pretence is that he knows something about international security. When it comes to international security, he is a phoney and he is weak.</DOC>

 - It is nice to get a question of substance from this side of the House. I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It was a delight to be in his electorate a couple of weeks ago and to meet with many of his supporters and the small business people in the electorate of Mitchell.In reply to the member for Mitchell, I inform the House that currently there are six state and federal IR systems that operate in Australia. That means that we have more than 4,000 awards operating in this country, which means that there are an estimated 40,000 different wage rates in Australia. In fact, it was recently estimated that there is around one award wage classification for every 27 employees in Australia. This is a system that is strangled by red tape. Imagine for a moment that Australia had six different income tax systems with 40,000 different tax rates. We would say that that was a system which was absolutely absurd - and that is true of this system of workplace relations.Figures in the labour movement recognise this problem. This week the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, argued:... let's fix the duplication, let's fix the different systems. In doing that you can take about a quarter off regulation, and that's pretty useful for our productivity.So here is the Premier of Victoria saying, 'Let's fix this sort of duplication.' Unfortunately and disappointingly, we have the Premier of Victoria, on the other hand, out there supporting the other states to retain their duplicated workplace relations systems. But Premier Bracks is not the only person from the labour movement who recognises the problem. In 2002 at the National Press Club, Mr Bill Shorten, who is the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union and the putative member for Maribyrnong -  - Yes, the putative something else too, Prime Minister. At the National Press Club, Mr Shorten said:Variations in state laws are also time-consuming and frustrating for employers. It is ridiculous there are more than 130 pieces of state and federal legislation pertaining to industrial law.That is what the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union was complaining about in a speech to the National Press Club a couple of years ago. Just recently we saw the Leader of the Opposition on the same platform with Mr Shorten saying, 'We've got many union leaders in parliament and there are going to be many more.' One of them wants his job, I know. But if the Leader of the Opposition is going to listen to the likes of Mr Shorten about the absurd confusion and duplication of legislation that we have now, then he ought to listen to us on the subject. Having a single system of industrial relations in Australia is something whose time has come, and it is something on which we will act, in the national interest, to seek to achieve.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker - If the dismissal is unfair then workers should have some redress.Why is that not in order? - The reality is that these are not extreme laws. What the government is proposing is the further, incremental improvement of workplace relations in Australia. When these proposals are passed through the parliament, Australia will still have a more regulated system of industrial relations than countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. That is the reality. Those countries which have adopted a more flexible system of workplace relations - and the United Kingdom is an example of this - have lower levels of unemployment and have more of their people in work. That is the reality.The UK has lower levels of unemployment. Tony Blair, the modern Labour leader in the UK, told the first meeting of the Trades Union Congress when he became the Labour leader that he was not going to make changes to what Margaret Thatcher had put in place. He said he was not going to make those changes, because it had led to a better outcome for the working men and women of Great Britain. That is what we are on about as well. The contrast to that are those countries that still retain inflexible and rigid workplace relations systems. Look at Germany, France and Spain, which have unemployment -  -  - They do not want to hear this. - What I was pointing out to the House is that those countries that retain inflexible and rigid systems of workplace relations - and the examples are Germany, France and Spain - have unemployment rates today of over 10 per cent. Conversely, those countries that have moved to a more flexible workplace relations system have lower levels of unemployment. At the end of these changes we will still have a more regulated system than, for example, Great Britain. These changes -  - Talk about displaying his ignorance. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'No, we won't.' No we won't have a more regulated system than Great Britain? Collective bargaining is not something that you have as of right in Great Britain, but it is something that we have in our system. That interjection shows once again that the Leader of the Opposition is simply ignorant on these matters. He does not know what he is talking about - weak, incompetent, ignorant.</DOC>

 - I do appreciate the member for Wakefield's question, Mr Speaker. My lip-reading skills were required at times! As this House knows, this is a government which does not just talk about Medicare; this government put in place the sensible improvements necessary to make a good system even better. Thanks to the government's bulk-billing incentives, I can inform the member for Wakefield that almost 85 per cent of GP consultations with people over 65 are now bulk-billed, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. And, thanks to the Howard government's higher private health insurance rebate for seniors, fewer older people need hard-pressed beds in public hospitals.I have been asked about alternative policies. The member for Lalor's only policy remains something called Medicare Gold. She told Meet the Press recently that everyone in Labor -  - I have been asked about alternative policies. -  - I certainly have been asked about alternative policies, and that is well and truly in accordance with the practice of this House. The only policy of the member for Lalor is something called Medicare Gold. She told Meet the Press recently that everyone in Labor believes in the principles of Medicare Gold. That is quite odd, because the former chief of staff for the Leader of the Opposition called Medicare Gold 'a strategic disaster'. The Labor intellectual Peter Botsman said of Medicare Gold that it was a policy with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. The President of the Labor Party himself, Barry Jones, said that Medicare Gold was a 'turkey', and even the Leader of the Opposition said about Medicare Gold that it 'disappeared with Mark'. So everyone, according to the member for Lalor, believes in it, except unimportant people like the party president and the party leader -  - Almost, Mr Speaker. I know members opposite are very touchy about their lack of a health policy - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. Obviously, ASIO's questioning and detention powers were developed with an awareness of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly encroaching on the rights of individuals. Questioning warrants are particularly useful where the threat of terrorism is immediate and other methods of intelligence collection will be either too slow or ineffective at obtaining information about suspicious activity. The questioning and detention process is subject to quite strict legislative requirements, which include clear time limits as well as the following safeguards. Strict criteria must be satisfied before a warrant can be issued. A warrant is issued by an independent issuing authority who is a federal judge or a magistrate. Strict time limits on the period of questioning apply - up to 24 hours, or 48 hours if an interpreter is required. The length of detention, to ensure that people remain available for questioning, can be for up to seven days - the period in which questioning in that 24- or 48-hour period can proceed. There is a right to seek a remedy in the Federal Court at any time. Supervision of questioning by an independent prescribed authority occurs, and that is a person who has had judicial experience. Criminal offences for officials who breach safeguards are included in the act. The ability of the subject of a warrant to contact the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman at any time to make a complaint about ASIO or the Australian Federal Police is also available as a remedy.Unfortunately, there is a good deal of misinformation and, some might say, misunderstanding about the way the powers operate. If people perpetuate these myths, it could lead to unjustified concern in the community. For example, the suggestion that the laws allow the authorities to 'disappear' somebody is completely without foundation. Warrants authorising detention must permit the person to contact others, including a lawyer of the person's choice. ASIO is a very professional organisation. It uses its powers to protect the Australian community judiciously and effectively, and only as a last resort.</DOC>

 - I acted with integrity and honesty in coming to a ministerial decision to sign off on the funding for Primary Energy. -  - They do not want to listen to the answer, do they! I made that decision based entirely on the material that was provided to me by the department in a minute that I studied and I signed off on 2 August 2004. This is just continual muckraking from the Labor Party. I would like to point out what the community thinks about this muckraking and this politically motivated Senate inquiry. - On Friday, 12 August 2005, in the well-respected Central Coast Express Advocate, the editorial was about the Senate inquiry into Regional Partnerships. It said:The whole inquiry is a political witch hunt staged by the Labor Party because it is still smarting over its poor performance at the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. He is working hard for Reynella East and Hackham West primary schools in his electorate. The Prime Minister and I announced early last year the conditions that would be placed on Australian government funding for schooling over the next four years: firstly, national consistency in Australian schooling from starting age to common testing throughout the milestones of school education; secondly, that the performance of Australian schools will be published and made available for the communities within which those schools are based; thirdly, that there would be plain language reporting to parents about the progress of their children so that parents have a very clear idea about how their children are performing at school.Something seems to have happened over the last generation in that the educational bureaucrats and ideologues have grabbed control of the school bus and forced parents to sit in the back seat with commonsense, so much so that today in Australian schools many parents are receiving language neutered, politically correct, meaningless reports that tell them absolutely nothing about the progress of their children. The Australian government's legislation, which was passed late last year, requires plain language reporting to parents. That means that parents will receive reports next year that tell them that their child will be rated A, B, C, D or E in specific subjects. Further to that, Australian parents in any school that receives funding from the Australian government will be told how their children are performing compared to other children in the class and across Australia.It was rather interesting that I read yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald about the announcement of the recently installed Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, in response to the Australian government's initiative that the New South Wales government will require A, B, C, D and E reporting for primary schools. I should inform the New South Wales government that they are 'moving in the right direction', to use their terminology. However, they will also need to do it for the compulsory years of schooling, which means up to and including year 10. The Premier said this at his announcement:'My daughter got a school report a couple of months ago, and on first reading, we saw all As and we thought 'Terrific'...The Sydney Morning Herald article continued:However, on closer reading, 'and it took quite some reading', the Iemmas were far less sure what they were looking at.It continued:'Where is our daughter in maths and English in relation to her schoolmates in her class?' Mr Iemma saidWhen looking at a New South Wales school report today, the Premier would be forgiven for having that attitude. Kids are ranked 'working towards', 'almost achieving' and 'achieved'. An 'A' in modern education speak is 'achieved'. Imagine the Prime Minister ringing Bob Jane during the Bathurst 1000 and asking, 'How's Skaifey going?' He does not want to be told he is 'almost achieving'. What does that mean? Is he off the starting line or can he see the chequered flag? If the foreign minister rings Richie Benaud and asks, 'How's Ricky Ponting going?' he does not want to be told that he is 'consolidating'. In response to these conditions of funding, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania have basically signed up for these conditions. Unless they have these plain language reports by New Years Eve this year, they will not receive a dollar of Commonwealth funding for schooling next year.I notice that the Tasmanian Essential Learnings report card - I do not know why they cannot just say 'subjects', by the way - says 'being literate'. The average parent would say, 'What does being literate mean? Does that mean reading and writing? Why can't they say it?' There is also 'reflective thinking' - something that perhaps the member for Franklin is doing at the moment. The reality is that Mr Mark Latham had many faults, but when he delivered his assessment of his Labor colleagues, he did so in plain language - A-grade something or other - because he knew that everyday Australians trying to feed their kids and pay their car loans knew exactly what that meant.</DOC>

 - I am aware of a number of statements of principle about our decision. But one that has really caught my attention is a statement of principle - and I think it is very well put - that has come from one of the roosters, none other than Senator Conroy, who is famous for his candour and honesty when it comes to taxation measures. He is now famous for what he has said about the principle involved in the government's decision. Being interviewed on ABC 774 Melbourne, he was asked this question:If you were to suck the ideology out of it though isn't it a better thing to have an organisation that is either private or public but not one half of each?Senator Conroy replied:It makes no difference to the majority of Australians one way or the other about the ownership structure.Let us just go back and repeat that: it makes no difference as to the ownership structure. In other words, the person who is the shadow minister in this area does not believe, as a matter of principle, that government ownership of Telstra is a good thing. This statement by Senator Conroy is at complete odds with everything that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the past few days. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around saying that the national interest has been sold out because of this. The reality is that his own spokesman does not believe there is any principle at stake. It is all a question of what is the best way to get cheaper prices and better services.I say to Senator Conroy: thank you for your candour; thank you for stating the obvious. It makes no difference whether it is publicly owned or privately owned. What does matter is whether you have an overall regime that delivers better prices and more competition. It is undeniably the case that, with the competition model established by this government and with Telstra in full private ownership, the consumers of Australia will get a far better deal. What Senator Conroy again has done is to bell the cat on the humbug of the Leader of the Opposition and his frontbench colleagues.</DOC>

 - The answer that the Labor Party has to all these questions is not to sell and to keep the status quo - the status quo that has delivered the present circumstances. At least we have taken a decision that is going to deliver the investment of $3.1 billion - $1.1 billion over the next four years into services into regional Australia to roll out that platform. It is a blend not just of investing in telecommunications services and providing the funding to invest in that, which is something that the Labor Party has never done -  - I am answering the Leader of the Opposition's question in outlining what the government is doing in this area, which is being proactive in terms of rolling out the ability to get internet services and mobile telephone services throughout regional Australia. It is a blend of funding proposals, it is a blend of regulation and it is a blend of increased competition. Nothing that the ALP has offered on this in this debate gives any indication of what it would do to ensure those services. - The Labor Party does not want to hear what the government is doing in a positive fashion because it has no alternative answer. One of the most important components of the package of measures announced by the government yesterday is the Telstra retail price controls, which will commence on 1 January 2006. The price controls will ensure parity in local call prices offered to regional and metropolitan consumers. Service providers will be required to maintain a cap on local calls, prevent further large increases in line rentals and encourage decreases in call charges. New price controls maintain a cap on new connections, meaning that they cannot rise by more than inflation. That is the undertaking that we have given in the package that we have announced.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The resource sector has played a significant role in boosting the level of exports out of Australia in recent years. In the last 12 months, our exports have reached a record high level of $162 billion. We continue to invest in infrastructure in our nation to make sure that we maintain our competitive advantage in this area. It is interesting to note some of the critical areas in the resource sector that have assisted in achieving those export levels. For example, coal exports reached a level of $17 billion in the last financial year and LNG - liquefied natural gas - exports reached $3.2 billion. At the beginning of 2006, our LNG exports will begin flowing to China, which will significantly boost that area of our resource export effort. We have achieved record exports of iron ore; they have achieved $8.1 billion worth of exports in the last 12 months.It is critically important that these industries enjoy not only operating within a very competitive Australian environment but also the sound economic circumstances that this government has created in this country. Those sound economic circumstances have enabled us to invest significant amounts of money in infrastructure across Australia - like the $12.7 billion investment in roads and rail through the AusLink program. Yesterday we announced a significant investment in regional telecommunications across Australia - a $3.1 billion package to improve telecommunications infrastructure across Australia. We would not have been able to do this if we had not paid off Labor's debt, in terms of what was being done to the Australian economy. Because we have paid off Labor's debt, we no longer have to pay dead money in interest on that debt and are now using that money to invest in infrastructure across Australia that will help to ensure the competitive nature of Australia's exporters.It is very important to note that governments can only make these sorts of investments of large amounts of public funds into infrastructure in Australia in two ways: they can do it from either savings or borrowings. The Labor way is to borrow the money to invest. Our way is to manage the economy well and invest the savings from that good economic management in infrastructure for the future of Australia.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is clearly no. The National Party have been part of a government that over the past nine years has invested more than $1 billion for the significant upgrade of telecommunications services in rural areas. But more than that, we have been part of a government that has introduced new levels of competition with regard to telecommunications carriers - we have more than 100 now - and we have seen more mobile phone competition with the introduction of Optus, Vodaphone, Hutchison, 3G and the like. Also, we have been part of a government that has served our rural constituency superbly by increased regulation, the customer service guarantee, the universal service obligation and price caps.Let us turn to the National Farmers Federation. I will leave aside the temptation to quote the National Farmers Federation on industrial relations and the Labor Party. Let us turn to their position on telecommunications. Like the esteemed Senator Conroy, the National Farmers Federation have never regarded ownership of Telstra as the key issue. The key issue, rather, is: what is the service for country areas, what is the level of competition and what regulatory regime is in place? So there is not much difference, it would seem, between the basic tenets of Senator Conroy's position, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, and the National Farmers Federation's position.On the issues of competition, regulation and filling market failure in country areas where it occurs, the National Farmers Federation have been enthusiastic supporters of government policy. I met with the National Farmers Federation Policy Council this morning and the President, Mr Peter Corish. I look forward to further discussions with him, answering questions and meeting their concerns.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. When the government brought down the landmark Intergenerational report in 2002, what it showed was that over the next 40 years, whilst the number of people of working age in Australia will hardly increase, the number of people of retirement age will double. That means that, rather than have five people of working age supporting each person in retirement today, we will have 2½ people of working age supporting each person in retirement in 40 years time. The government have to ensure that expenditures are on a sustainable basis, that the economy grows fast and that more people are in work. We have to set Australia up by strengthening its financial future.There are two ways that the government are doing this. The first, of course, is getting the monkey of Labor debt off the back of the Australian taxpayer. The Australian Labor Party bequeathed a Commonwealth debt of $96 billion. By 30 June this year our government had reduced Labor's debt by a net $80 billion; and, according to budget forecasts, by 30 June next year out of Labor's $96 billion of debt we will have reduced that debt by $90 billion.The second thing that we can do to overcome Labor's mismanagement of the Australian economy is in relation to privatisation. This government has a policy that the proceeds of privatisation will not be spent and wasted like they were by the Labor Party. Labor are not against privatisation. Let me remind the House of some of the Labor Party's privatisations. Labor privatised Australian Airlines, they privatised the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, they privatised the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, they privatised CSL, they privatised the Commonwealth Bank and they privatised Qantas. But in each one of those privatisations they spent every last dollar of the proceeds and at the end of the financial year had neither the shares nor the proceeds to show for it - and ran up debt in addition. This government will not be doing a fraud on future generations with a privatisation program like that. This government is going to set Australia up for its future by ensuring that we start making provision now for that changing demographic by putting a basis down against our superannuation liabilities and by giving young Australians a go by getting the Labor Party debt monkey off their backs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and recognise his important role as the Chair of the House Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which has undertaken some major inquiries. One of the impediments we face at the present time is the fact that there are still in this country around 2,300 federal awards and around 1,700 unsimplified state awards. That means that there are more than 4,000 awards in existence in Australia, which means that there are some 40,000 award wage classifications - that is, there is an award wage classification for every 27 employees in this country. This is a complex arrangement. These are prescriptive documents which in most cases most normal employees cannot understand.Despite this, the Leader of the Opposition on 29 July this year told the American Chamber of Commerce:Industrial relations laws should ensure that businesses can get rid of restrictive work practices ..._            _            _... Labor is absolutely not opposing managers having the prerogative to organise workplace practices and decide how the job gets done.And yet the Labor Party, led by the Leader of the Opposition, supports multiple state systems full of awards that continue to contain restrictive work practices. For example, if you take the New South Wales Pastoral Employees (State) Award, it states that, where the kitchen is within 229 metres of a shearing shed, smoko lunches are to be held in the shed. If it is 230 metres, it is different; if it is 228 metres, it is different. This sort of mind-numbing detail is the sort of thing we still have in these 4,000 awards in Australia. To take another example, the New South Wales Wine Industry Consolidated (State) Award requires that employees shall not be engaged for more than three hours in throwing skins out of vats. It does not matter whether they want to do it for 2¾ hours or 3¼ hours; the award again has these prescriptive requirements, saying that three hours is the prescriptive limit.The problem for the Labor Party is that their current platform calls for a return to a system of comprehensive awards. This is what the Australian Labor Party want: the old unsimplified metal industries award; 422 pages of prescriptive requirements. This award is 422 pages of prescriptive detail that wants to regulate every minute of every hour of workers in Australia. This thing weighs over a kilo. That is what they want: 422 pages. The Leader of the Opposition says, on one hand, 'We want a simple system,' yet their platform, which he signed up to, gives us 4,000 of these for the workers of Australia. That is a major impediment, and it is something which we will get rid of.</DOC>

 - I totally agree with what the Minister for Finance and Administration said. One of the things that the honourable member probably would know from the time in which he supported the Commonwealth Bank privatisation and the time in which he supported the Qantas privatisation, of course, is that where a seller goes into the market they do not name a price in advance until such time as they have done the book build, until such time as they have seen what the demand is going to be, until such time as they know what the conditions are going to be and until such time as they have decided that the best price available for taxpayers can be obtained.That is a rule which we have followed in relation to T1 and T2. It is a rule that we will follow in relation to T3. It is a rule that the Labor Party, when they used to believe in privatisation, used to follow in relation to Qantas and in relation to the Commonwealth Bank. Until such time as all of those matters have been decided and the government have decided on a sale, the government will not be naming our price. One of the reasons is that obviously conditions change all the time. You determine at the time of the float the best available price, and it is the price that you go out into the marketplace with.I have said yesterday, and I will say it again: this government is not a distressed seller. We are not like Labor was when Labor announced that it had to sell the Commonwealth Bank to try and balance its budget. If the budget is already balanced, it does not need the proceeds of Telstra to try and balance the budget. We have the option to wait for advice. We have the option to maximise the return for the taxpayer -  - We have the option -  - We have the option, in order to maximise returns for the Australian taxpayer, to ensure that the Australian taxpayer gets the best return. Wouldn't that be a great thing? Rather than see the whole proceeds dissipated, the shares lost, the budget run into deficit -  - and debt run up, wouldn't it be a good thing for the people of Australia to actually get a return on their investment?</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, first can I join you in welcoming here Dr Abdullah Abdullah, the Foreign Minister of Afghanistan. I am delighted to see him back in Australia again. He was here in November 2002. It has been a real privilege for me this morning to open jointly with Dr Abdullah the new Afghanistan Embassy in Deakin. I would like to congratulate the Ambassador, Dr Saikal, too, on the great job he has done here in Australia representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. We will be sorry to see him go soon but I know he is going to a senior position back home in Kabul.We are very proud of the role that Australia has played in the overthrow of the Taliban and the defeat of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. We are firmly committed to assisting Afghanistan on its path to democracy and freedom and assisting the people of Afghanistan in the reconstruction of their country. We have provided substantial assistance for Afghanistan's reconstruction. Australia would have spent about $110 million since the end of 2001 on reconstruction in Afghanistan. This financial year alone we will be spending around $26 million, including in areas such as crop substitution, to help Afghanistan deal with the very substantial issue of drugs.Over and above that, let me remind the House that our military contribution to Afghanistan will resume during the course of next month, when we send our SAS troops, and also we expect to participate in a provincial reconstruction team at some point next year. Senator Hill has more to say about those things. For us to continue to make a contribution to Afghanistan not only is appropriate but is consistent with the passion this government has for supporting freedom and democracy. What we have been able to do to help Afghanistan has been important for Afghanistan, and it has been important for us to know that, in the war against terrorism, we are making a solid contribution and also contributing to the welfare of the many millions of people of Afghanistan.</DOC>

 - I cannot, without reference to him, speak for the shareholder minister in the government in relation to Telstra, and that is the finance minister. I will speak to him. If there is anything more I can add to this answer following that discussion, I will.The principle is that the engagement of a managing director or chief executive, even by a company which is majority owned by the government, is ultimately a decision of the board. The Telstra board decided on the circumstances that led to the former managing director departing the company, and the Telstra board engaged Mr Trujillo. We were informed, to the best of my knowledge. But at no stage, to my knowledge, did we seek to dictate to the board - nor should we have done so - as to who should be chosen as the chief executive; nor indeed the terms and conditions on which he was engaged.Generically speaking, I point out to the member that Telstra is a very large company by world standards. The reality is that there is a very competitive market for the recruitment of high-quality CEOs. It is easy pickings for an opposition to start talking about a big contract for a Telstra CEO, but placed in the same position as we are at present - which I hope for the sake of the Australian people will be a long time into the future - you would not have taken any different attitude, and do not be hypocrites and suggest otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her excellent question. I am aware of a proposal that was released in September last year which purported to guarantee to everyone over 75 -  - There was a proposal that was made public in September last year which purported to guarantee to everyone over 75 immediate access to free treatment in hospitals. Because this proposal was underfunded to the tune of some $4 billion over just two years, this was going to help people over 75 at the cost of harming everyone under 75. Not surprisingly, this proposal was rejected by the Australian people as a con job -  - That is right, Mr Speaker. This proposal was roundly rejected by a whole host of senior figures in the community. - I was asked about community reaction to this proposal, and I have to say that some very sensible people have rejected this proposal. Michael Costello, former chief of staff to the member interjecting opposite, said that the proposal was a strategic -  - The well-known Labor intellectual, Peter Botsman, said of this particular proposal that it was designed with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. The National President of the Australian Labor Party described this proposal as a turkey. This proposal was even dismissed by the Leader of the Opposition himself, who said, 'Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark.' The only person who still believes in Medicare Gold is the member for Lalor, who said recently, 'Everyone in Labor believes in the principle of Medicare Gold.' Everyone in Labor, that is, except the party leader and the party president. What she is really trying to do is to show up the Leader of the Opposition as alone and isolated. This government certainly does not support Medicare Gold, because Medicare Gold for people over 75 means 'Medicare Light' for everyone else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Griffith for the question. It gives me an opportunity to tell the House what was done in respect of this matter. I would have thought that somebody with a background in the diplomatic service would understand that the right and most effective procedure was followed.The member for Griffith asked what has been done or what will be done about it. Let me say at the outset that all Australians are outraged that this sentence has been reduced. I find it offensive, and I think millions of Australians would find it offensive, but I am advised that the remission took place automatically under a presidential decree, which was put down in 1999 by former President Wahid. I also understand that, as a result of this issue, the status of that presidential decree is now being reviewed but that review will not have any impact on remissions that have occurred automatically under that decree.He asked what representations were made. Direct personal representations were made by David Ritchie, our ambassador in Jakarta, to the Foreign Minister and the Attorney-General of Indonesia. They were the right representations; they were at the right level, and they were made by a very distinguished Australian diplomat, who has a better understanding of the modalities of diplomacy -  - than the interjecting, rather erratic member for Griffith. It is all very well to sneer at David Ritchie, somebody who has demonstrated the best possible standards of service of the Australian Diplomatic Service. He also made representations to the President's own ministerial adviser. I believe that the representations that have been made by the government in this matter were the right representations. - Let me conclude by saying again that the Australian ambassador in Indonesia, who has served this country in Indonesia with great courage and distinction, did the right thing in the right way at the right time to the right people, and all the fulminations of the member for Griffith cannot alter that fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he, as a very good representative of many members of the Australian Defence Force up in Townsville in the electorate of Herbert, is concerned about their welfare. We have around 1,370 troops involved in Operation Catalyst. About 770 of them are on the ground in Iraq helping the Iraqi people forge ahead with the democratic processes. The Al Muthanna Task Group comprises 450 people. There is the 55-strong army training team doing logistics training; the RAAF Hercules detachment of about 120 providing airlift; and the RAAF Orion detachment of around 160 doing maritime patrol operation. And HMAS Newcastle, which has a ships complement of 220, is deterring and intercepting vessels within Iraqi waters suspected of undertaking illegal activity. We have a security detachment in Baghdad of around 100, and we have some headquarters elements - air traffic controllers, doctors and so on. We are fully committed to supporting Iraq's democratic transition. We wish to see the earliest practicable full transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi government. The fact is that conditions will determine the timing of that, not a calendar.I know that the member for Griffith - talking of alternative policies - agrees with the government on these things, albeit secretly, because that was revealed in the Bernard Lagan book. The Leader of the Opposition, for his part, has had many policies. We in my office try to keep track of the different policies of the opposition. I think the last time I spoke of this there were 20. Now we must be up to around 28 since we first deployed to Iraq; I am not 100 per cent sure, though I believe I am more of an expert on the opposition policies on Iraq then they are.On 18 May on Radio 5AA, the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether we should get our troops out of Iraq. He said:I'm not putting any false timetables on it and obviously we'd do it in consultation with our allies.On 8 August, the member for Barton, who is the opposition spokesman for defence, said - criticising the government, of course - that the government should set a time line for withdrawal. The Leader of the Opposition on the same day said in the media that the commitment of foreign troops is a 'wrong commitment'. In other words, it is wrong to have foreign troops there providing security for the Iraqis and for the democratic process in Iraq. I had not heard that from the opposition before. I knew they were opposed to us getting rid of Saddam Hussein in the first place, but I did not know they thought it was wrong to have troops there now. The opposition's position on Iraq can be summed up with one word, and that word is 'weak'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. In the face of a misleading campaign from the ACTU, one in which we saw, played out on film in Lateline last week, the President of the ACTU saying words to the effect, 'We would like to find the grieving mother and father of an injured or killed worker in Australia for the purposes of our political campaign' - in the face of a misleading campaign in which the ACTU President said, 'That would be just fantastic' - we will provide information to the Australian people about what these changes are about and not the misleading and politically opportune -  - When faced with a misleading campaign like that, where the ACTU will seek to scare and frighten Australian people and is prepared to go to the depths of saying, 'We would like to have the grieving mother and father of some injured worker to help our campaign' - something which is absolutely disgraceful, something which ordinary Australian people, I believe, find quite offensive - we will properly educate them about the changes.</DOC>

He would be interested to know that the government is committed to providing practical assistance and emotional support to those in Indigenous communities who are victims of family violence or at immediate risk of family violence.I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member that the government has delivered in full on its $22.7 million commitment over four years to double the number of Indigenous family violence prevention legal services around Australia. There are now 26 units, predominantly located in remote and rural areas - very much like the member's electorate. That is, I think, highly beneficial.All family violence prevention legal service units have the capacity to run community awareness and education programs specifically directed at breaking the cycle of family violence. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Many Rivers family violence prevention legal unit at Kempsey on its community awareness program, which demonstrates that you can achieve real and significant outcomes with Indigenous men and women with the services that it provides.There is still much to be done, and I will be working closely with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that a whole range of measures are implemented together to ensure that we work on ending family violence in Indigenous communities.</DOC>

 - I make two points in answer. Firstly, the ambassador was not sent in to talk to officials. In the parlance of diplomacy, 'official' does not refer to a minister. The ambassador spoke to the foreign minister of Indonesia and the Attorney-General of Indonesia. To describe that as simply speaking to officials is to misstate the position, and the Leader of the Opposition knows that.The reference to the presidential decree was a statement of the obvious - that is, that the law governing this flowed from a presidential decree, made by the former president of Indonesia, Dr Wahid. In those circumstances, until that presidential decree is changed - and it has been indicated to us that it is under review - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon, who represents one of our important northern gateway ports and is therefore particularly interested in security issues, and who has played a key role in encouraging the investment that is occurring in upgrading Australian security both at our airports and particularly also in the maritime area.Australia are investing significant sums in improving security for our transport system, but naturally we have concerns about aircraft and ships that come to Australia from other parts of the world where the security measures are not so robust. We have been working cooperatively with our neighbours to endeavour to upgrade security arrangements. Indeed, Australia has committed almost $5 million over the next few years to help domestic management of preventative security measures in places such as South-East Asia, the Pacific and particularly Papua New Guinea.We are also, though, working closely with some of our major trading partners in this region. Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting the Singaporean transport minister, Mr Yeo, to discuss issues regarding security in transport between our two countries. Singapore is perhaps the number one immediate embarkation point for visitors to Australia. We have been working cooperatively. An agreement has been in place for some time which enables us to work on a range of additional measures. Yesterday we agreed that these arrangements should be extended to maritime security. We will be working with Singapore on a range of projects to help upgrade maritime security in the region.Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the International Maritime Organisation are hosting a major meeting on security in the Malacca and Singapore straits in Jakarta next month. Australia will be a participant. We are also involved in a range of other activities in that region to help strengthen the security capability and build a regional maritime administration regime that is particularly security conscious.The government of Japan is hosting a ministerial conference on international transport security in January 2006. Australia is being invited to join the G8 nations to participate in that conference. We are playing a key role in upgrading security, not only domestically but also through arrangements to ensure that our neighbours, especially those countries that are sending freight, passengers, aircraft and ships to Australia, also have a strong culture of security to keep our country safe.</DOC>

 - My thanks to the honourable member for his question. Obviously, it would never be appropriate to lock up somebody for any length of time illegally. The circumstance to which the honourable member refers is the fact that, out of the 88,000 detainees that were taken in in Australia over the time, 201 were found to have perhaps been wrongfully detained. It is also a fact that many of those 201 were actually people who declined to give reasons for their being in such a situation. Also, quite a number of them refused to give their identities. - I might add that this is hardly news. It was a question that was answered by my colleague three months ago. - Of the 88,000 people who were detected as being in Australia illegally, around 75 per cent were given bridging visas and about 25 per cent entered detention. The 201 cases the member refers to have been referred to the ombudsman to look at. We have no intention of allowing 88,000 people to be illegally in Australia simply on the off-chance that the odd mistake might be made. I think what the -  -  - The member for Watson is obviously suggesting that the police should never arrest anyone unless they know there is going to be a conviction at the end of the day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. He talks about another program that has been an incredible success for the Howard government: Green Corps. We know that Green Corps has helped about 13,000 young Australians since it was implemented to improve the environment around the country, in particular in this case in the electorate of Casey. I know that people on this side of the House are very supportive of a program that not just helps young people but, importantly, provides the opportunity to advance local environments across the country.The member for Casey has spoken to me a number of times about this particular project and the way in which Green Corps has helped his electorate. Today I want to talk specifically about the Warrien Reserve in Croydon North, which suffered significant damage from illegal clear-felling last year. Thanks to Green Corps this bushland area will be rehabilitated. Over the next six months there will be weed reduction, planting of native species and the construction of walking trails. Significantly, the area is home to two endangered species of frogs. By preserving and rehabilitating this area, these endangered Australian species will be preserved.Today I would like to congratulate Keith Roper, Marie Ward and David Pockett from the Warrien Reserve group, who have fought for this project and who do so much for their local community. Congratulations also to the member for Casey and to all those members on this side of the House who support such a tremendous program.</DOC>

 - Can I first say, through you, Mr Speaker, to not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the lady in question, that I can fully understand why she would say that. I can. I can fully understand that anybody caught in that situation - anybody who had a son, a daughter or any other relative or friend in an apparently very dangerous situation - would feel that way. If she feels that the government has in some way failed her, I apologise to her, because we never like to fail those who we are charged to represent. If she feels that way, then of course that is how she feels and I do not seek in any way to avoid responsibility. But can I say that her criticism, however understood and however well intentioned, is misplaced and, for reasons I will try to explain, unfair.It is the case that, when a disaster of this magnitude occurs, the only way it can be fairly handled, properly handled, efficiently handled and safely handled is for it to be handled by the domestic authorities. The idea that you could have the military personnel of a range of foreign countries operating independently within the United States to rescue their own foreign nationals is a recipe for chaos and potentially for bloodshed, particularly in a society which has a far more -  - This is quite a serious issue and I am going to deal with it in a serious manner. The reality is that for anybody to suggest that the military forces of this country, as guests in another country, could operate in some independent way inside that country to rescue our nationals, without accepting that the military forces of Great Britain, Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua and a whole range of other countries also have personnel in the United States - the Leader of the Opposition talked about tripping over diplomats. Tripping over diplomats would be chicken feed to tripping over the armies of several other countries had the advice of the Leader of the Opposition been followed.The Leader of the Opposition on this occasion has succumbed to a piece of cheap populism. It is nothing more. If you doubt that, I refer you to some remarks made by the member for Griffith, speaking on Sky TV only yesterday:To be fair to the government and to Mr Downer, I think their hands are tied at the moment by the United States authorities, which for so long now have not allowed Australian consular officials access to the disaster affected areas. - Oh, that was yesterday! He has said it all: that was yesterday. You know what has happened? They turned on the radio this morning, they heard a bit of talkback and they thought, 'Gee, we can score a cheap political point on this.' We know exactly that that is what the Leader of the Opposition did. I do not blame any of the people. I do not blame the lady quoted. I say again, quite unconditionally: if that lady thinks I let her down then I say to her that I am sorry. I have tried in the 9½ years that I have been Prime Minister never to let an Australian down. If any Australian thinks I have let them down, they will always receive an expression of apology and regret from me. But I have to say, on behalf of the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that I think the criticism that is being made of them is unfair.That was the view of the member for Griffith when he was in Mr Responsible mode yesterday. But a day later he is in Mr Populist mode and he thinks he can score a cheap political point. I think that the Australian people will understand it. Some will be critical of me, some will not - that has always been the case; it always will be the case. But I say to that lady: I understand how she feels, but it is not fair to blame the efforts of the consular officials, it is not fair to blame the behaviour of the government. We did what we could in the circumstances. I think the attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to make a bit of political mileage out of this is absolutely pathetic.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Last week I visited the electorate of the member for Cook. I attended a function in company with the member for Cook and the member for Hughes. When I was there the member for Cook did not remind me about the performance of certain football teams but he did remind me that unemployment in the Sutherland Shire has now reached an amazing low of about 2.3 per cent. That is an example of the way in which the families of Sydney, in company with the families of all Australian cities, have prospered under this government.I can inform the member for Cook that last week the Treasury released its analysis on the tax position of a range of Australian families - and was that not fascinating reading. When it modelled 20 family types - from young to old, with varying income levels; singles and couples, with or without children - it found that all family types modelled were estimated to have experienced an increase in real disposable income of between 12.7 per cent and 29.5 per cent between 1996 and projected into 2006. In other words, every single family type that was modelled had enjoyed a massive real increase in its disposable income. This is not only a consequence of the general strength of the Australian economy but also specifically a consequence of the family tax benefit system that has been introduced by this government and which is clearly in the gun sights of the member for Rankin and the member for Lilley, both of whom over the last two weeks have begun to gnaw away at the family tax benefit system and to talk darkly and glibly about middle class welfare, which is code for introducing an income test on average Australian families.Let me go back to the Treasury analysis - I should not allow the member for Lilley and the member for Rankin to distract me. The Treasury analysis shows, amongst other things, that a single-income couple on an average wage with two children will have increased their real disposable income by 29.5 per cent, from $38,000 to $49,000; a single person on an average wage will have increased theirs by 21 per cent; and senior Australians will have also substantially increased theirs by between 12.7 per cent and 27.8 per cent. The Treasury paper also calculated the net tax threshold for the 20 family types. The net tax threshold is the income point at which personal income tax pay exceeds cash benefits received. In 2005-06, an estimated 38 per cent of all families will receive more cash benefits than they pay in personal tax. The story in that department is even better for larger families. Fifty-nine per cent of families with three or more children aged under 16 pay no net tax - no tax in net terms.This analysis, which is of government policy over the last 9½ years, is in stark contrast to the alternative offered by the Australian Labor Party. The policy taken by Labor to the last election proposed the abolition of the government's $600-a-child payment, a payment that hundreds of thousands of families all around the country are receiving at this very moment. Also under Labor's election policy, parents were punished by up to $2,000 a year if they chose to stay at home and look after their children. What this Treasury analysis does is to demonstrate that the greatest winners under this government have been the low- and middle-income families of Australia. This government is immensely proud of that achievement.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. My office and my department have received hundreds, probably thousands, of calls. During a crisis like this, I admire the incredible patience, perseverance and hard work that they put in - I am sorry if that does not suit the opposition. I think they do an absolutely outstanding job. It is incredibly stressful. Those in the opposition who have had the privilege of being in government would understand that in a situation like this it is extremely difficult. I can only speak with great admiration for the work that they have done.In terms of Senator Boswell, he issued a statement today and I will table that, if the honourable member wishes. I am delighted that John McNeil, Mr McNeil's son, is now safe and has been evacuated from New Orleans. On Brisbane radio this morning, John's mother, Mary McNeil -  - Personally, I would be pretty tempted to hang up on you. -  - We will come back to you a little later. Honourable members of the opposition might be interested to know that John's mother, Mary McNeil, said on Brisbane radio this morning:I tried to explain the other night about the problem that the Australian government have had getting in and they have only been aware of one side of the ledger.She went on to say:So now they do realise that the American government have stopped our people getting in there.The point here, as the Prime Minister said, is that those who were trapped in New Orleans were understandably unaware that our consular officials were not able to get in. It is also understandable that they became upset and frustrated. I think that now people better understand the situation of what was possible and what was not possible. In this particular instance, we are delighted that John McNeil is safe and sound.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I say to the honourable member that I appreciate her serious interest in this terrible issue. As the Prime Minister has covered some of this ground already, I will be brief. But let me say that, thankfully, there are no reports of Australians who have been killed or seriously injured at this stage, though we do remain concerned about two people. One of them is a 75-year-old dual-national who has lived in the United States for a long time. He lives near New Orleans. The other is a 30-year-old Victorian man who was scheduled to be in a hotel in New Orleans when the hurricane hit. The consular officer who has managed to get into New Orleans has had the opportunity of going to the hotel. The hotel was apparently undamaged but locked, closed. We have not yet been able to track the 30-year-old Victorian man.On that point, I should also add that we know of around 15 Australians - I will choose my words very carefully here - who may still be in the affected area. That is not to say that they are - they may be. A lot of these people have been permanent residents of New Orleans and surrounding districts. They may be awaiting evacuation or they may not. We are pleased that eventually an Australian consular officer, who invited a British consular officer to join him, became the first consular officer from any country to enter New Orleans and to look for stranded Australians. He followed up on the information about Australians who might be in the area.There has been, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, some comment that consular and military staff should have been sent into New Orleans sooner. We need to understand that we are, unfortunately, constrained by the laws and the rules of a foreign country, this time the United States of America. We expect - as do the British government, the Canadian government, the Mexican government and all other governments - our consular officers to adhere to local laws and the advice of local authorities when they are in a foreign country. What is more, we certainly would not want to put more Australians into a position of danger by flouting local laws.I think our ambassador and our staff at the embassy in Washington have done a simply outstanding job. I would like to express my admiration for the endless hours of work our consular staff have been doing in Baton Rouge, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and elsewhere. They have worked tirelessly day and night. The Prime Minister quoted the opposition spokesman earlier - I will not read the quote again. We appreciated the support - up until today - of the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition put out a press release on Friday saying that the Australian Labor Party will support any assistance the government seeks to provide to the people of New Orleans and surrounding areas.In a tragic situation like this, none of us should trade on misery. It is a sad thing that the Labor Party has decided that this most appalling of tragedies is today, on 5 September, worthy of party-political debate. I must confess, enthusiastic as I often am about party-political debate, I do not happen to agree with that political judgment. I think that will do the Leader of the Opposition a good deal of damage with the Australian people.</DOC>

 - It is my understanding that a number of Australians were assisted out of the area in New Orleans by, I think, two of the channels. As to whether, their having got to Texas, some of those expenses were paid by another channel, I am not personally aware of that, but if the Leader of the Opposition asserts it I will not argue the toss with him.The Leader of the Opposition continues to make the point. He has chosen to have a go at the government - that is his right. I simply say to him that we must observe the laws of the countries in which we operate. I am sure that, if a similar disaster were to befall this country, Australians would not appreciate Americans in this country taking the law into their hands in order to save their nationals. I do not believe that for a moment. - I am referring to the proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition that Australian military personnel should have commandeered helicopters in order -  - You said it today. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Where did I say that?' He ought to have a look at the transcript of his press conference. He ought to have a look at what he said. I noticed that in his indulgence he retreated a bit -  - I stand by what I have said. I think what the Leader of the Opposition has done in this is very unwise. I can understand that Australians who have been caught up are concerned. I have said that, if any Australian feels that the government let them down, I regret that. I have said that repeatedly. I do not believe that they have been let down when you take all of the circumstances into account.As the member for Griffith was fair and generous enough to acknowledge 24 hours ago, our hands were tied by the fact that the American authorities would not allow consular people to go in. The member for Griffith, who has had a little more experience in this than the Leader of the Opposition, acknowledged that yesterday. In the 24 hours that have gone by, the opposition have made a tactical decision that they can get some political mileage out of this. That is exactly what they have done. It is as transparent and as weak as that. The attack by the Leader of the Opposition is as insubstantial as that, and I agree with the observation made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the Leader of the Opposition's motives.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. Like him, all Australians are very interested in what we are doing to assist, where we have the capacity to do so. As I speak, three experienced emergency managers from Emergency Management Australia, an organisation within my department, are travelling to the United States to assess what expertise we can offer to the recovery process in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The team brings experience in community capacity building and the social consequences of disaster, and a detailed appreciation of international disaster coordination arrangements. In particular, the team will share its experience in developing disaster assessment strategies; identifying areas of high community risk such as public health, accommodation and transport issues; prioritising community needs such as shelter, food, water, electricity and safety; and structuring a coordinated community response.Emergency Management Australia has recent and very significant experience from responding to the Indian Ocean tsunami; major cyclones, which have impacted on the Northern Territory and elsewhere and devastated several Pacific nations; and, most recently, forest fires in Sumatra. It has strong links with the United States emergency management agency, FEMA, which is leading the United States response to this disaster. I met with some of FEMA's senior officials when I visited the United States in July, and I know they understand the importance of an all-hazards approach to emergency management, ranging from terrorist attacks to natural disasters. Of course, that has taken on additional significance in the light of these recent tragic events.Like all Australians, having watched the devastating footage from New Orleans, I am pleased that we are in a position to offer expert assistance to the United States at this time. Like the Leader of the Opposition, I am glad of the support that Australians are giving. I might add a little information. The Red Cross, which is coordinating support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, can be contacted through its web site www.redcross.org.au or on 1800811700.</DOC>

 - The government has not failed its citizens. What occurred in this particular case was that a decision was taken by the United States government not to allow in consular officials from any country. If in fact the Leader of the Opposition is saying that we have failed, then he is saying that Tony Blair has failed and he is saying that the Canadian Prime Minister has failed. The Leader of the Opposition is engaging in cheap populism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa would be aware, as all members would be aware, that ABS figures for Australia's international trade in goods and services for the month of July were released last week. Those figures indicated that, in July, exports of goods and services rose by two per cent to achieve an all-time record monthly figure of $15 billion worth of exports of goods and services.There have been significant increases and record highs in both value and volume terms in 2004-05 and these were achieved again in the month of July. This is right across the economy, and the member for Maranoa's own electorate contributes significantly to that through beef exports and a lot of resource exports that go out of the electorate of Maranoa in Queensland. The government has worked hard over the last nine years to create a solid economic platform in Australia, through sound economic management that has delivered a very competitive circumstance to Australia's exporters of both goods and services. Interestingly, the ABS statistics showed that Australia's exports rose in all sectors, not just the resource sector. - The member interjecting might listen to the statistics. In the ABS figures, which showed that all sectors increased, in the non-rural and other goods area - which includes the resources sector - our exports rose by three per cent. In the manufacturing sector, exports rose by 2.1 per cent. Rural exports rose by one per cent and services also rose by one per cent. I know that it has impressed the members of the Labor Party that all sectors of the export community have increased their capacity.It is important that we also note some of the rationale behind this. It has been this government's sound economic management over the last nine or so years that has delivered a set of circumstances in Australia that are increasingly competitive and superefficient. That economic management, which has delivered low interest rates, low unemployment, low inflation and budget surpluses -  -  - They are interjecting. The government gave it to them. Look at the surplus budgets. When did the Labor Party ever produce a surplus budget? What the Labor Party did give us was $96 billion worth of debt. Something else this government has done is pay off Labor's $96 billion worth of debt. If you look at the economic fundamentals that have developed in this country under the leadership of the coalition government, you will see that the coalition government has created an incredibly strong, competitive and efficient platform for Australia's exporters to compete on the world stage and increase what they are selling to the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I can understand why he is interested in this topic, because the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Braddon has increased by almost 20 per cent - 20 percentage points - over the last 12 months. I should point out that bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly to pensioners and children under 16. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, the national GP bulk-billing rate was almost 75 per cent in the June quarter. That is, three out of four visits to the GP were bulk-billed. That is up from only two in three GP visits being bulk-billed in October 2003. I can inform the House that, at 82 per cent, the bulk-billing rate for children is at an all-time high. At 69 per cent, the bulk-billing rate in country areas is at an all-time high; it is up 16 percentage points on December 2003.The member for Lalor likes to talk down our Medicare system. She likes to say that increases in bulk-billing rates are unsustainable. I can inform the House that the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Lalor has risen eight per cent over the last 12 months. I look forward to her press release saying that the Howard government is truly the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and for the interest he shows in the issue. The first meeting of the Asia-Pacific partnership is to be hosted by Australia later this year. It will bring together for the first time six key Asia-Pacific countries to pursue a technology focused pro-growth approach to addressing climate change. The foundation partners - Australia, the United States, China, Japan, India and Korea - represent about half the global population, GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. It has been welcomed, not surprisingly, around the world - by the British environment minister, who said that it was a welcome step forward, by the German environment minister and by the European Commission. Last week I met with the Canadian environment minister, Stephane Dion; he came to Adelaide. He said that Canada would be interested in playing a role in the partnership as well. Several other countries, by the way, have also expressed an interest in joining.Are there any alternative views? Within the Labor Party there are several alternative views. The opposition leader - thinking there might be votes in it, I suppose - said, 'It's nothing.' That is what he described it as: nothing. The member for Grayndler issued two press releases in two days condemning the partnership. They were headed 'Secret climate pact more spin than substance' and 'Climate pact spin and hypocrisy' - classic opposition press releases.But, if I may say so, I am thankful to some members of the ALP for turning around ALP policy. The shadow minister for resources, the member for Batman, in a speech on 23 August, did not say it was nothing, as his leader did; he welcomed the initiative, saying that it represented:... a regional partnership of great significance and even greater opportunity - and that it - has the capacity to make a serious global impact on patterns of energy use and greenhouse emissions ...I very much welcome the contribution of the member for Batman. Somebody in the opposition is having a bit of a think about the substance of what is going on in Australia, instead of just trying to work out what the latest opportunistic political line might be. The tragedy is that you have someone like the member for Batman not being mentioned at the moment as a possible Leader of the Opposition. Given the more serious approach he takes to public issues, I think he would make a much better Leader of the Opposition than the opportunist who happens to be sitting in that chair for the moment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. We are on the cusp of major reform of the building and construction industry in Australia. It is reform which has been four years in the making. It will see the end of the unlawful, corrupt and illegal behaviour that was identified by the Cole royal commission in the commercial building and construction industry. It is notable that this reform has been fought tooth and nail by the ALP and the Leader of the Opposition, yet in the Cole royal commission Justice Cole identified the Leader of the Opposition's state as one in which some of the most corrupt practices occurred.This is what the Cole royal commission said about Western Australia:The building and construction industry in Western Australia is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously. At the centre of this culture and much of the unlawful and inappropriate conduct is the CFMEU.This is important economic reform, because it delivers benefits to all Australians. As the Econtech report demonstrated, the reality is that getting rid of corrupt and unlawful behaviour in the commercial building and construction sector could lead to a one per cent increase in GDP in Australia, something which flows through to ordinary Australians whose retirement investment is tied up largely and partly in the major constructions in the capital cities around Australia. That is, the extra cost of building major buildings in Australia is something which flows through and affects the retirement incomes of many hundreds of thousands of Australians.It is appalling that, in the face of this clear evidence about corruption and unlawful behaviour, the Leader of the Opposition will not support what is going on. Instead, what we have from the opposition is support for what they call the Victorian system. In fact, at the 2004 inquiry into this bill, we had Labor senators saying that the committee majority recommended that the government promote cultural change through the industry by encouraging states to institute tripartite industry councils at state level, and that the Victorian model could be used as an exemplar. The exemplar of the Victorian model is what the Herald Sun described last year as 'Rort City: unions' free beer, BBQs and phantom pay cost states millions'. Not only do the Labor Party want Rort City in Victoria; they want a policy which basically means 'Rort Nation', rather than just 'Rort City'. The government are going to do something about the rorts in the building and construction sector; we will get this legislation through the parliament and, for once, this side of parliament will be able to do something to clean up that unlawful and corrupt behaviour.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. He is well aware of the government's commitment to the $12.7 billion AusLink initiative, something which will help involve our nation in upgrading infrastructure, particularly in road and rail, from one end of the country to the other. Some major nation-building projects are involved in the AusLink plan. I am very pleased to note that, in the member's state of Victoria, there has been a ready commitment to the AusLink program and, as a result, some significant projects are already under way - one example is the government's commitment of $121 million to the Pakenham bypass. But, unfortunately, other states have not followed Victoria and South Australia's lead. In fact, states like New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have still not signed up to AusLink. As a result, funding from the Commonwealth for important road and rail projects ended on 1 July. There is simply no funding available to those states unless they are prepared to be a part of the AusLink process, which will unlock significant financial resources to those states.I have been meeting with ministers in various states to try to talk through the issues. It is important that they be resolved, because we want to get on with the task of building many of these important projects. I know that the member for Cowper has been particularly concerned about the Bonville stretch on the Pacific Highway, and recent accidents demonstrate again how vital it is that the project should proceed. The Commonwealth are ready, and our funds are ready. All we are waiting for is New South Wales to sign the AusLink agreement and get on with the task.I know that there are similar projects in Queensland and other states which are ready to go, so I call upon the states to move quickly and to agree to the AusLink arrangements. Victoria and South Australia have agreed, so why is there such a problem for people in other states? If they do not get involved quickly, from 1 October all the unsigned agreements will also be subject to the new construction code guidelines that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has just spoken about. I would encourage all the transport ministers to immediately make commitments to AusLink so that we can get on with the important task of these nation-building construction projects in every state.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the hardworking member for Greenway for her question. On Friday, the Minister for Workforce Participation and I launched a new marketing campaign called Support the System that Supports You. It is an attempt to properly inform all Australians that they should properly support the welfare system and that if they engage in fraud they will be caught and they could end up going to jail.This program is very important. Fraud and compliance are key parts of Centrelink's activities. Last year, Centrelink reviewed over four million entitlements, and that resulted in over 700,000 customers having their payments cancelled or reduced. We save over $50 million a week as a result of fraud and compliance activity. Centrelink investigated 70,000 tip-offs, and that resulted in 17,500 customers having their payments cancelled or reduced. If we can send a message to those who are attempting to defraud the system: last year there were nearly 3,000 convictions for welfare fraud.We have to do our part to help families and those people endeavouring to do their best to properly comply with the system, and one of the ways to do that is to bring together the agencies within human services, to work in partnership as against sometimes working against the interests of each other. I can report that the Senate has just passed the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which ensures that Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission no longer have boards, that they are directly reportable to the minister - that being me - and that the HIC, after 30 years, will become Medicare Australia.So what does that partnership mean? It was brought to my attention that, in order to claim the maternity payment or in order to claim a Medicare card for your new child or in order to claim the family tax benefit, you had to fill out extraordinary forms that go on forever, covering pages and pages with questions - more than 32 questions - and, in addition, you had to go not just to Centrelink but also, separately, to Medicare, to get your Medicare card. As from March next year, a three-page form replaces these indecipherable, complex forms that end up causing people great grief. That is going to save Australian families seven million pages of questions each year. That is what human services is about: better delivery for consumers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that the government party room this morning approved the introduction of the Telstra sale legislation and accompanying bills into the parliament this week. This will give effect to the government's clear, unambiguous and longstanding policy, in sharp contrast to the policy confusion on the other side, to which I will be pleased indeed to return in a moment. Two of the five bills will be introduced into the Senate and the three that contain appropriation elements will be introduced into the House of Representatives. This legislation will establish a $2 billion fund, the dividends of which will provide future guarantees in relation to services. The Connect Australia fund will provide upgrades of services around Australia.The reason the government have always supported the sale of Telstra is that we believe it is in the best interests of a good telecommunications policy for this country. The greatest burden that Telstra carries at the moment is not the burden of regulation but the burden of majority government ownership. If people are really interested in better telecommunications services for the Australian people, then they will want a Telstra that is free and able to operate without the encumbrances that do not apply to the operation of companies of a like size. I believe that the full sale of Telstra will usher in a new era of competitive provision of telecommunications services around Australia.The Labor Party parade their commitment to public ownership of Telstra, and yet they were the party that presided over record job reductions in the old Telecom when it was fully owned by the government. They were the party that allowed the collapse of the old analog network for rural Australia. They were the party that deceived the Australian public in relation to the ownership of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and would have us believe that their attitude to Telstra is not going to change.Let me contrast the attitude of the government with the attitude of the Labor Party. We went to the 1996 election committed to the sale of one-third of our share in Telstra. We went to the 1998 and subsequent elections with a clear-cut policy to sell the remaining government ownership in Telstra, subject to services in the bush being up to scratch. We have never shirked from saying to the Australian people what we believe. I know there are a lot of people opposed to the sale of Telstra, but we believe it is in the long-term interests of this country's telecommunications network to get the yoke of majority government ownership off the back of the largest telecom in Australia. That is why we are committed to this policy and that is why we have taken this decision.Let us have a look at the mealy-mouthed, indecisive, incoherent policy of the Australian Labor Party. Today, speaking on the Today show, the Leader of the Opposition was asked a question. Listen to this very carefully. It is so instructive of the sharp, incisive stance of the Leader of the Opposition. This is what the questioner had to say:Mr Beazley I'm interested to know just finally, if it is partially sold by the time the next election comes around, will you go to that election opposing the full sale?BEAZLEY:Well we're not going to go into the business of buying Telstra back, or buying taxpayers ...No, I do not think even you would want to buy it back; I think I understand that. The questioner then said:So you won't then?To which the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:To buy Telstra back. But we will, if it's say, there's still a Government's holding of 30 or 40 percent by the time the next election comes around, you take a look around the globe. You'll find that there are plenty of equivalents of Telstra in which the Government's hold a minority share holding. We will seek to continue to have influence on what Telstra does.Was that a blatant denial? Was that the Leader of the Opposition standing up and saying, 'This is my policy: I will not sell any further shares in Telstra'? The reality is that, if the Leader of the Opposition were ever to become Prime Minister, he would do to Telstra what he did to the Commonwealth Bank and to Qantas. Despite any commitments the Leader of the Opposition makes to the Australian people, if Telstra is not fully sold and he were to become Prime Minister, he would race to the brokers to sell it as fast as possible. You would not see his heels for the dust. He would rat on his previous commitments the way he did in relation to the bank and Qantas. The Australian people know that and we certainly know it, and we will remind him of it every day from now until the next election.</DOC>

 - I am aware of what happened to the share price yesterday. The reasons for that are mixed. I do not believe for a moment - I have made this public and I am going to repeat it now - that the remarks that were made by senior executives of Telstra were in any way helpful. I think it is the obligation of senior executives of Telstra to talk up the company's interests, not to talk them down. That is a view which I have communicated very directly to the chairman of the board on behalf of the government.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and his interest. There are still no reports of any Australian casualties as a result of Hurricane Katrina. We know of around eight Australians who may - not necessarily are - still be in the affected area and may be awaiting evacuation. We are still working on that.Overnight our consular officers returned to New Orleans. We have concerns still about a 30-year-old man from Victoria who was scheduled to stay in New Orleans at a hotel. We have not been able to find him or any trace of him, and we are looking into that. We also have fresh concerns about a 37-year-old Queensland man who lives in New York. Apparently, according to his family, he went to New Orleans to film the hurricane and contacted his family just before he got there, and he has not been heard of since. We will continue to do what we can to try to track him down. I am, on the other hand, very happy to report that the 75-year-old dual national has now been located safe and well in a nursing home just outside of New Orleans.Are there any alternative views? Yesterday we saw an extraordinary press conference from the Leader of the Opposition - a man who made remarks which will be remembered in the way his predecessor's remarks about 'troops out by Christmas' were remembered. What the Leader of the Opposition claims is that he is some kind of an expert on foreign security policy. I have not seen any sign of that in recent times. Indeed, I noticed this morning that the Leader of the Opposition was starting to backtrack on his position by saying he did not want to make a big deal of this. Yet yesterday he called a big press conference - with flags and so on. The poor old spokesman for foreign affairs was sitting there looking decidedly uncomfortable as the new 'troops out by Christmas' foreign policy gaffe was made by a new Leader of the Opposition.Let me make this point about the Leader of the Opposition's proposals absolutely clear. Firstly, the proposition that consular officers should break the laws of a foreign country and go into New Orleans is a preposterous proposition which would have added to a number of Australians at risk. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition said he wanted Australian defence personnel from around the United States to head to Louisiana and somehow get onto helicopters and head for New Orleans. This is what Ambassador Richardson said this morning on the radio, which is the point that the Labor Party complimented. I think his words should be considered. In an interview on 2GB he said:... the notion that we could send in helicopters to rescue these people over and above all others is simply nonsense. It would, one, have possibly endangered their own lives, let alone the lives of those in the helicopter.The Leader of the Opposition sneers, but this is our ambassador in Washington. He went on:You will be aware very early on when some of the early helicopters went in there were shots fired. To have gone into that situation to attempt to take out nine young Australians, leaving behind many people, other people in far worse situations would not have been a very sensible thing to have done, even if we could have done it, which we couldn't. Leaving aside the morality of it.The fact is that what the opposition has said demonstrates something very important about the Leader of the Opposition. What he has demonstrated is he lacks judgment. If you want to be the leader of this nation, you have to be somebody with good judgment. This is a Leader of the Opposition who lacks good judgment. He pretends to be an expert on foreign policy, but he has no judgment.Let me conclude with this point. I resent very much the criticism of the consular officers in America and the consular branch here in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. These are exceptionally good people; these are hardworking people; these are people who care about Australia and Australians. You are making party political points at their expense.</DOC>

 - Let me say, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, that I am satisfied, the government is satisfied and the government party room is satisfied that the conditions set for the sale of the remaining government interest in Telstra have been guaranteed by the arrangements we are putting in place. There is this idea that somehow or other Australia, alone, under the policies of the Australian Labor Party, can produce a telco which is perfect, which is fault free, which never has a complaint and which never has a line down. The Leader of the Opposition asks me about 14 million alleged faults for Telstra. The last time he tried to be specific about some Telstra equipment was last week when he went to a telephone booth near Bundaberg in Queensland and made a lot of the fact - I think he even held a tin can up to his ear - that it was out of order. The only problem for the Leader of the Opposition was that that telephone booth had been decommissioned by Telstra 3½ years ago. And do you know why, Mr Speaker? Because nobody was using it. If the other 14,499,999 complaints are the equivalent of that, the Leader of the Opposition has not got much of an argument.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and her interest in the role that Australia plays in the expansion and improvement of global economic performance, particularly in the trade area. It is very important to her electorate in northern Victoria, I am sure.For a long time, Australians have been pushing very hard on all fronts to achieve broad based global trade reform at a multilateral level. We are this year on the cusp of achieving some significant outcomes in that area as far as the WTO is concerned, and in particular the Doha Round of negotiations, which reaches a critical point in December this year at the ministerial meeting in Hong Kong.Today, we welcome the statement that has been put out by a number of business councils across the world supporting countries such as Australia that are pushing hard to get a very productive outcome out of the Doha Round. A release by the Business Council of Australia said:Six of the world's leading business organisations today called on member nations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to intensify their efforts to achieve a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA).That was supported by business organisations in Australia, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan. It goes without saying that it is incredibly important for continued growth across the world - the developed world and the developing world - that this round of negotiations is successful. Global reform is essential.We should also recognise the significant role that domestic reform plays in strengthening our economy and our competitiveness in the global economy. Domestic reform is something that our government has continued to prosecute the case for over a number of years across a number of different fronts in terms of taxation reform, industrial relations reform and, of course - the current debate at the moment - reform of the telecommunications system and industry in Australia.One of the critical elements - one of the critical components - of a modern, competitive, efficient economy is a modern, competitive, efficient telecommunications system. As part of the package of reforms that we are announcing for our telecommunications system, we are advocating significant investment for the future in our telecommunications system across Australia, increased competition and sound regulation in terms of compliance and ensuring that services are provided to all Australians so that no matter where you live in Australia, no matter where you are doing business - either domestically or internationally - you are competitive as far as telecommunications are concerned.There is $3.1 billion in the Connect Australia package, aimed at extending the modern telecommunications system in Australia that consumers expect. The competition and transparency will be increased through separation of Telstra's operations. And, of course, regulation to give certainty and security as far as access and costs are concerned is important for all Australians.We have seen a lot of comments from the Labor Party on this issue. We saw the commentary from the Leader of the Opposition on television this morning about Labor's position. I think that made it as clear as mud to all Australians. The most important thing that the Labor Party can do, if they are genuine about securing decent telecommunications services in regional and rural Australia, is to support the government's package - support the government's legislation so that we can see this investment take place in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - In answer to that question I stand by what I said in my answer to the previous question - that is, the conditions precedent to the sale of the government's remaining share in Telstra, established by me before the last election, either are met, in the assessment of the government, or will be met by the accompanying measures to the sale legislation that will be introduced by the minister for communications.While I am on my feet can I pay particular tribute to the work done by the minister for communications, Senator Coonan, on this issue. She, along with Senator Minchin, the finance minister, has had principal carriage of this matter on behalf of this government. As is typical of all the members of my front bench, charged with a particularly complicated responsibility, they have discharged it with very great skill, very great dignity and a wide appreciation of the broader membership of the party.</DOC>

 - I can appreciate the member for Barker's interest in this matter because GP bulk-billing rates in his electorate are up by no less than 16 percentage points over the last 12 months. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, bulk-billing rates are up right around Australia. Bulk-billing is up by five percentage points in New South Wales, eight percentage points in Western Australia and Victoria, 11 percentage points in Queensland and 13 percentage points in South Australia. And bulk-billing rates have improved by a whopping 19.5 percentage points in the great state of Tasmania. It is no wonder we have two great members from Tasmania on this side of the House.Three out of four GP consultations are now bulk-billed and 85 per cent of GP consultations for people over 65 are bulk-billed. Bulk-billing rates for children are at an all-time high. Bulk-billing rates in country areas are at an all-time high. The Howard government's tremendous success in improving bulk-billing rates was not universally anticipated, I have to say. I was given today a brochure distributed by the member for Chifley in about September or early October last year. It said: 'A Latham Labor government will reverse the collapse in bulk-billing.' Let me say to the member for Chifley: bulk-billing in his electorate is at 98.3 per cent! I also have a brochure distributed by the member for Blaxland at about the same time. It said:Now the federal government wants to take bulk-billing away, with a new $20 fee every time you visit your GP.I can inform the member for Blaxland that bulk-billing in his electorate is up to 96.4 per cent. That is just a selection of what members opposite were saying at that time. I am sure that, next time they distribute something to their electorates, they will set the record straight and they will finally admit that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I did have a meeting on or about 11 August with the chairman and the managing director. I was accompanied by a number of my senior colleagues. There were a lot of views put to us. There was a proposition put to us. We rejected the proposition and adopted our own, which was announced by the minister, which we think is superior. That has formed the basis of the announcement I made a few moments ago and it will be enshrined in the legislation put forward.I know the Leader of the Opposition is slithering around for a policy on this issue, but he really does want to have it both ways. One moment everything that Telstra does is wrong, every service is rotten, every connection is about to fail and it is doom and gloom all around the country, but in the next breath everything that Telstra puts up to the government has to be adopted. The reality is that, until we get the burden of majority government ownership off Telstra's back, it will not be able to operate as a fair dinkum company in the Australian telecommunications market. That is the reason why we are going to sell it. It has nothing to do with budget proceeds; it has nothing to do with ideology.Let me give the House just one illustration of the encumbrance that Telstra now suffers by virtue of government ownership. If it wants to raise new capital by issuing shares, it cannot do so. The law forbids the government ownership to fall below 50 per cent; therefore, if there is a share issue, the government has to buy additional shares - and even the Leader of the Opposition thinks that's a bad idea, because he said so on the Today show this morning. It is a simple thing like that: if you operate a company and you want to raise some more capital, under current government ownership the only way that you can raise capital is to go further into debt and to borrow it - you cannot issue shares. To say to a company the size of Telstra that it cannot embrace an equity issue and then pretend that you are living in corporate Australia 2005 shows yet again that, when it comes to the normal, basic operations of business in this country, the Australian Labor Party does not have a clue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. As he knows, under this government, over the past 9½ years, there has been strong wages growth in Australia. Indeed, we have seen wages growth in Australia go up by over 14 per cent, thanks to the government's strong economic management and the fact that we have a low-inflation and low-unemployment environment in which, throughout Australia, the demand for workers is strong. This will continue to increase wages in the future.Unfortunately, some members of the opposition do not share this view. Last Thursday the member for Perth, in a lengthy speech, predicted that employers would drive wages down in search of quick profits under the new workplace relations proposals. He said:... low pay, as the Government is effectively advocating, discourages businesses from the uptake of more efficient productive systems ... in preference for greater utilisation of low paid segments of the labour market.This is not the first time that we have heard these sorts of comments from the member for Perth. I recall that, back in 1996 when the government introduced the Workplace Relations Act, he famously and incorrectly predicted that it would lead to lower wages and worse outcomes for Australian workers. The argument has been effectively shot down. The scare campaign which the Labor Party and the ACTU were running was effectively shot down last week by none other than John Maitland, the National Secretary of the CFMEU. Mr Maitland, speaking at an industrial relations conference, said:The work force of today and tomorrow wants good wages, decent hours, a career and a life. Employers relying on a reduced safety net are not going to end up with nothing.He is saying that, if employers are into driving down wages, the reality in the current environment is that they simply will not have workers. I do not often agree with Mr Maitland, but in this case he was absolutely right when he said that employers who would seek to rely on a reduced safety net will not end up with workers in the future. That is the reality that Mr Maitland knows. It puts a lie to the campaign of scaremongering by the Labor Party and the ACTU about the government's changes. The reality - as he has conceded - is that employers will continue to provide wage rises in order to be able to attract workers in the future.The increase in wages under this government, an increase of over 14 per cent in real wages over the last 9½ years, stands in stark contrast to the record of the ALP. On 1 April this year, the Leader of the Opposition made this great boast about their record in government:We achieved 13 years of wage restraint under the Accord. The wage share of GDP came down from 60.1 per cent when we took office down to the lowest it had been since 1968.Here we have the Leader of the Opposition making the claim - proudly, it seems - that under Labor in government the wages actually went down. That stands in stark contrast to what we have achieved since we have been in government. We are about higher wages and better outcomes for Australians, not what the ALP have been about in the past and will be about in the future. We stand for higher wages and we stand for more jobs for Australians, and that is what we will bring about.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is: no, it has not. - The limitation under which Telstra labours at the present time, the greatest encumbrance it has and the thing that stops it operating properly as a company in the Australian telecommunications market is majority government ownership. Until you get rid of that majority government ownership, you will not give Telstra a fair go. -  - The Australian Labor Party can make as much inane noise as they want, but they cannot avoid the commercial reality that the largest company in Australia is in majority government hands and is thereby prevented from doing what any company might at some stage want to do to expand, acquire or diversify - that is, to issue shares in order to raise fresh equity capital. Until you take that burden off the back of Telstra, it will never realise its full potential.That is the bottom line of what this debate is all about. That has been our consistent position for years. If the Australian Labor Party were honest and if they were in our shoes, they would acknowledge the same thing. Those sorts of arguments were the arguments used by the Labor Party in government to break their undertaking to the unions about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas. They said, 'We have to do this in the name of commercial reality.' The only difference between them in government and us in government is that we were honest enough to tell the Australian people on four successive occasions what our policy was going to be. We have been upfront with the Australian people and we have been consistent with the Australian people. The policy that we have approved today in our party room will create a new era of expansion for Telstra. It will give Telstra the opportunity to operate in full competition in the Australian telecommunications market and it will deliver -  - far better services for Australian telecommunications consumers, whether they are in the city, in the outer metropolitan area or in rural Australia. We have a clear, consistent, forward-looking policy. The Labor Party are mired, as usual, in their negative, opportunistic opposition tactics, and the Australian people will see through them as they have seen through them in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for a life of commitment to education as a teacher before becoming a member of parliament. The government's vision for education, science and training is that every Australian, especially every young Australian, should be able to find and achieve their own potential, whatever that is, and to recognise that they are all different. The future that we envisage is that no young Australian should feel that his or her life is valued by the educational choices that they make. The choices that young people make in university are no more valued by this country than those that young people make in TAFE or apprenticeships or training and, of course, the progress from school to getting a job. To that end, the government has initiated many policies, including the construction of 24 technical colleges; scholarships for students in technical trades; giving apprentices access to common youth allowance and Austudy; making sure that we have toolboxes and a whole variety of things available to students; and $143 million for a career transition program for students, to make sure that every single young Australian is able to be supported in developing their own career transition plan.I am asked about other policies. I opened the Australian newspaper on 24 August this year. Under the headline 'Teachers' president gives PM 'a whack'' was a report of a speech given by the Federal President of the Australian Education Union, Ms Byrne, on behalf of 160,000 Australian teachers. Ms Byrne said:'Voters cared more about the Coalition's example of trust - the economy - than they did about refugees and Iraq _She said:'The economic frame fitted better than the compassionate one.'She went on to say, in that speech:_ truth is not enough to win the education debate _In that speech, amongst many things, she said two things: firstly, she accused the average, everyday Australian of placing the economic welfare of their family and the future of their children above all else and, secondly, she said the truth had no place in the education debate. I am not normally known for calling for these things, but I call for the resignation or the removal of the president of the Australian Education Union following those remarks. - I heard absolutely nothing said by the Australian Labor Party. Two days later, on 26 August, the Australian newspaper, on its front page, reported another education story: 'Teachers reject profit motive'. - The article said:THE national teachers union has questioned whether schools should be teaching the skills needed to get jobs with companies that seek to profit from capitalism.Listen to this, Mr Speaker:The union's submission argues against vocational teaching aimed solely at equipping school students for the workplace -  - In its submission to the national inquiry into teaching, the Australian Education Union has bemoaned the fact that Australian teachers are preparing young people for work.Interestingly, on 26 August - keep in mind that this is two days after we had the president of the AEU basically condemning Australian families for re-electing the Howard government, and saying that truth has no place in the education debate - the same day that the same union bemoaned the fact that teachers are preparing young people for work, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition addressed the Victorian branch of the Australian Education Union. The deputy leader said 1,549 words; the first 10 words were these:It's great to be here today. It's also quite appropriate _So I thought, 'Right, we are now going to hear from the Labor Party some condemnation of these outrageous remarks by the Australian Education Union.' - Instead, I found the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this:Labor recognises that fostering a culture of professional leadership and excellence within our schools is _ vital _ Part of that is including representational bodies like the AEU in the policy development process.She went on to pledge that the Labor Party would consult groups like the AEU. Here we have got the Labor Party hand in glove with the Australian Education Union, and a leadership that is not fit to represent teachers throughout Australia. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you want the Australian Labor Party to be engaged in the real issues that face education and the interests of the children of mainstream Australians, you will need to remove the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from the education portfolio because, believe it or not, Australians want their children to be prepared for work and believe that those children need to see a place for truth in all debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Probably the economic policy of the Howard government, which has delivered almost 1.7 million Australians jobs since 1996, has been the single best thing we can do for families and also do for their retirement incomes. Each and every one of those 1.7 million Australians is now contributing to their own retirement through superannuation.Over and above that, the government's hugely popular and successful super co-contribution scheme has been a wonderful success. In fact, figures just provided to me indicate that in excess of $309 million has now been paid out directly to low- and middle-income Australians as they make provision for their own retirement. Some 571,000 middle- and low-income earners have contributed directly to their own superannuation, and for each dollar they have put in they have received a dollar from the Howard government.This is a policy that has been rejected by the Labor Party. They have made it amply clear that, given the opportunity to take over the treasury bench, the Labor Party would ignore the low- and middle-income earners of Australia and would abolish the co-contribution. I remind Australians that that co-contribution was further expanded and that, from 1 July last year, for every dollar that low- and middle-income Australians put in the Howard government will give them $1.50. Later in the year we will be able to give figures to the population as to how popular that has been.The member for Wakefield happens to come from an electorate which the Parliamentary Library describes as one of the lower socioeconomic, most disadvantaged electorates in the country, and yet nearly 3,500 of his constituents have made a direct contribution to their own superannuation. They have taken up the incentive of the Howard government and, in doing so, have done something to improve their own retirement income.Finally, I would remind all Australians that, as a result of our transition to retirement policy, more Australians will be able to remain connected to the work force and take their superannuation and will be able to get the best of both worlds. Through them doing so, we will retain the wealth of experience of older workers in the work force but give them the opportunity to maximise their retirement and their wealth as they take their super and their wages and continue to contribute to this great nation of ours.</DOC>

 - I think even the member for Melbourne would understand that the responsibility for the day-to-day management of the company is that of the management. They are answerable to the board. The board is appointed by the government. The managing director is appointed by the board. So it is not a question of the government allowing or disallowing anything. Speaking on behalf of the majority shareholder, I would expect Telstra, being subject to the Corporations Law of this country, to observe the Corporations Law of this country. - One thing I am not in a position to do at this dispatch box is to give legal opinions. If the member for Melbourne has any complaints about the behaviour of Telstra, he ought to raise them with Telstra. I am not going to try to sit in judgment on them. All of this goes to the service provision of the company. - Let me, as the question gives me the opportunity to do, just remind the House of some of the changes which have occurred over the last little while which I think speak volumes for the policies this government has put in place and also for the contribution that Telstra itself has made to the development of telecommunications services. For example, the number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now more than 1.8 million. Australia is now in the top 10 OECD countries in terms of the rate at which broadband penetration is growing. The latest OECD figures show that Australia made a lot of ground on broadband take-up in the past 12 months. That covers the period from the time of the last election until now, and it is relevant to the quality of the decision taken by the government party room today. Australia has lifted to 7.7 subscribers per 100, up from last year's 3.5 subscribers per 100.In 2003 broadband penetration in Australia's metropolitan areas was 7.5 per cent, while in regional areas it was only five per cent. Actual overall market take-up rates for broadband are now running at 20 per cent for metropolitan areas and 19 per cent for regional areas. Fifty-two per cent of internet enabled small businesses now have a broadband connection. That is up from 41 per cent only a year ago. Eighty-six per cent of Australian small businesses have an internet connection, and 61 per cent of Australian households had internet access at the end of September 2004. The number of mobile phone services is now 16.5 million, which represents a penetration rate of 80 per cent.These are but a sample of a whole range of figures that illustrate very clearly the growth in both the quality and the availability of telecommunications services in this country. That has gone hand in hand with the growth of competition. It has been the growth of competition that has spurred that improvement, and more competition will lead to more improvement. More competition can only be achieved in large amounts through the full privatisation of Telstra, and that is why the full privatisation of Telstra is in the interests of the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and for her continued interest in Defence matters. She has the naval aviation base HMAS Albatross in her electorate, and I am sure that she will find this information in terms of recruitment and retention to be of some interest. Since the 2003 work force planning review and the Defence people plan, there have been a number of changes to the approaches taken to recruitment and retention. There is more emphasis on operational as opposed to non-operational members; there is a further emphasis on contractors, as were used for our forward logistics support in the Solomons; there is stronger utilisation of the existing work force in terms of adjustment in career structures, employment options and flexible employment practices; and there is a greater emphasis on our reserves.But we have been even more innovative, and I would like to share with the House some of the innovative approaches taken by Navy recently to improving retention of marine engineers and weapons electrical engineers. Using its human resource decision support system model, Navy analysed a range of data from exit surveys and personnel workshops and found there were a number of steps they could take to ensure that these highly trained people were retained in the defence forces.In the long term, younger people are seeking lifetime learning - in other words, continuous professional development that is benchmarked against their civilian colleagues. Through the Institute of Engineers Australia, we are ensuring that our engineers can have chartered professional engineering status by funding their enrolments, annual membership, assessment fees, registration and ongoing professional training.But it is also in the short term that we need to retain these highly skilled people, so we have brought in a competency based as opposed to rank based encouragement for them in terms of bonuses. These range from $5,000 to $15,000 a year, will cost some $3.18 million in the current year and were only just signed off in May. I am pleased to tell the House that Commodore Longbottom, the Chief Naval Engineer, has said that, anecdotally, these are having a significant impact on highly skilled engineers who might have looked at moving into the civilian engineering work force.I can assure the House that we will continue taking innovative approaches to maintaining our skilled work force in Defence. Our present 12-month rolling ADF separation rate is 11.4 per cent. Under the Labor Party, the separation rate was 13.2 per cent - in fact, that was when the Leader of the Opposition was Defence minister. More than that though, Defence is seen in a very positive light. Compared with 1995, confidence in our defence forces by the Australian public has improved by 14 per cent, increasing to 82 per cent. In the 10 years, the decade, during which the coalition has had the opportunity to encourage our defence forces - to prepare and better resource them - confidence in Defence has grown. We will continue with our innovative approaches to retention and recruitment.</DOC>

 - We have a very interesting choice of language by the Leader of the Opposition: everything is 'extreme' now. They must have had a focus group where somebody said, 'Why don't you keep saying everything is extreme and then maybe a few people are going to believe it.' There is nothing extreme about any of the policies of this government - except that for a lot of middle Australians they are extremely beneficial. Mr Speaker, let me remind you of the Treasury analysis. I will carry this Treasury analysis around for months into the future. It is a wonderful analysis and it goes to the extremely improved position of average Australian families. -  - The question was based upon the proposition that this policy of the government is extreme. I am pointing out that this policy of the government is not extreme. But I am also taking the opportunity of pointing out that other policies of the government are extremely successful. So I think I am very relevant.I go to the second part. The Leader of the Opposition asked me: is the policy - the very sensible, balanced, middle-of-the-road, intelligent, far-sighted but not extreme policy of the government - bearing that description responsible for the situation? The answer is no. The answer is that the government's policy of privatisation has been frustrated by the Labor Party for 9½ years but now, because of the decision of the Australian people - an extremely welcome, an extremely beneficial and an extremely intelligent decision of the Australian people, particularly in the great state of Queensland, which delivered us four out of six seats - we may well, the Senate willing, have the opportunity to remove that yoke from Telstra. I think that will produce an extremely good outcome for telecommunications consumers in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde, who is not just a local hardworking member but also a very decent member of this parliament. She has been one of the most successful advocates of Work for the Dole in this parliament, and she knows that, whilst the Australian Labor Party hates Work for the Dole, this government stands firmly and squarely behind what has been a very successful program. I want to pay tribute to the member for Forde today, because I recently attended her electorate and went to a graduation ceremony for single parents who had been involved in a Work for the Dole project. It provided them with a great opportunity to build their self-esteem, to build their self-confidence, and it really is what the Work for the Dole program is about. - I will come to that. - It is not happy reading for you. Stay tuned: it is bad news for you. What did we have on the day? I want to pay tribute to one of the graduates, Cheryl, who had been out of the work force for 15 years. After her involvement in the Work for the Dole program, she said:I have learned a lot about myself and that I can still work and that I am capable ... I am someone who has a future again.I can report to the House that, as a result of that Work for the Dole program, Cheryl is now working for a local accounting firm. It has changed her life, as it has changed the lives of tens of thousands of people who have been through the Work for the Dole program. But we know that she is not the only recipient. We know that Barbara, from Toowoomba, who is 34 years of age and had been unemployed for 17 years, is now working with McCaffertys coaches after going through the Work for the Dole program. We know that John, from Hobart, landed a job with a local 4½-star hotel. His life has been transformed as well. We know that Stephen, also 34, from Ballarat, who took up an IT position with IBM, is doing well and, as a result of his involvement with Work for the Dole, is in employment.I cannot understand why the Labor Party continues to talk down and to hate Work for the Dole. We know that there have been 335 occasions where people on the other side of this parliament have talked down Work for the Dole. Most importantly today, I want to highlight one of the silent champions in the Labor Party of Work for the Dole. It is none other than the member for Shortland. She loves Work for the Dole. She was at the recent Work for the Dole programs. I thank her very much. All I say is: please talk to your colleagues; ask them and the Leader of the Opposition to embrace Work for the Dole.</DOC>

 - These national account figures are good news for the people of Kingston and they are good news for the people of Australia. This great result is due overwhelmingly to the efforts of the working men and women of Australia and the business men and women and risk-takers of Australia. I commence my answer by thanking the working men and women and the business men and women of Australia for the tremendous contribution they have made to the economic condition of this country.These accounts show that gross domestic product grew by 1.3 per cent during the quarter to be 2.6 per cent higher than it was a year ago. It is a very strongly based, broadly constructed growth figure. It comes essentially off a very strong growth in business investment, which is at record levels, and bodes very well for future growth and for jobs. We have had a 6.8 per cent increase in business investment in the quarter. Household consumption has grown by 0.7 per cent. Nominal GDP rose by 2.9 per cent and that was in part boosted by a 5.8 per cent increase in the terms of trade. This is the best movement in the terms of trade recorded since 1988, which is 17 years ago. What it demonstrates is the extraordinary contribution which is being made by the mining industry of this country, spurred no doubt by the very strong domestic economic conditions.I have got some even better news for the people of Kingston and for all the working men and women of all the electorates of Australia. I can say to them that real wages, according to these national accounts, have now risen by 14.9 per cent, just a tick under 15 per cent. So once again we have a set of economic figures that reinforces the proposition that the Howard government is the best friend that the working men and women of this country have ever had, because it is the Howard government that has looked after the working men and women of this country. It was the Keating government and the Hawke government that boasted about driving down the real wages of Australian workers. I am proud to lead a government that, because of its balanced economic policy, has seen a steady rise in real wages and a steady fall in unemployment. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.In terms of budget forecasts, GDP growth for the 2004-05 financial year was 2.3 per cent, which is slightly above the budget time estimate of two per cent - overall, an outstanding figure. Again, my thanks go to the working men and women of Australia and the business risk-takers of this country for the contribution that they have made to the prosperity they are entitled to enjoy.</DOC>

I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has raised that section of the Telstra Corporation Act, because the whole thrust of what the Labor Party has been saying is that, in some way, we should have disclosed it. The reality is that, according to the advice I have from the department of finance and from my own department, it would have been against the law for the government to have done so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and acknowledge his close interest in the growing strength of the Australian economy and what it does for the many great Australian exporting industries, including those in the seat in Hinkler, particularly in Gladstone. A strong Australian economy is required to provide a stable and strong platform off which Australian exporters can launch themselves into the international marketplace and compete in that marketplace. The economic platform at the moment in Australia is arguably in the best condition that it has been in for decades when you consider that Australia has incredibly low levels of interest rates, sustainable economic growth, low unemployment - arguably the lowest unemployment for about 30 years - low inflation and that the government continues to produce budget surpluses.Over nine years we have paid off Labor's debt, which is the responsibility of the Australian taxpayers to service. We have paid off almost $96 billion worth of debt. Combined with that and off the back of that, in 2004-05 Australia's exporters achieved a new record, both in value and volume terms, of $162.3 billion worth of exports of goods and services out of Australia. Today the national accounts for the June quarter of 2005 were announced. They showed a 1.3 per cent growth in the economy in the June quarter, which accumulated a real growth of 4.6 per cent over the financial year. That indicates the Australian economy is continuing to strengthen. That is good news for exporters, but it is also as a result of that export growth that we have experienced. They have made their contribution to that economic growth.It is interesting to note that exports rose by 1.6 per cent, rural exports rose by 3.9 per cent and, even more interestingly, manufacturing exports rose by 7.9 per cent in the June quarter. That was a great outcome for the manufacturing industries in Australia. But, most importantly, Australia's terms of trade increased by 5.8 per cent in the June quarter. This was the highest quarterly growth in the terms of trade since September 1988. All this shows that, while our government continues to manage the Australian economy well and provide that platform for Australia's exporters, Australia's exporters will continue to take advantage of that platform to compete in the international marketplace and increase our exports.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. One of the many right things to do when you are in my position and that of senior ministers is to obey the law. The law that I am talking about was originally introduced by the honourable gentleman opposite when he was the minister responsible. It was amended by us in 1996. - Very touchy! As if anything turned on that, Mr Speaker. What something does turn on is that all of what has happened in the last 48 hours has driven home the absurd conflict of interest that this government has by continuing to be the majority shareholder. - If I may resume the answer that I was giving, Mr Speaker, what has happened - and I think this goes to the nub of the whole debate of substance about the sale of Telstra - is that over the last 48 hours we have seen the essential conflict of interest the government now has. When the managing director of Telstra and the chairman of Telstra come to see me and my colleagues, we receive them in three capacities. We receive them as the majority shareholder; we receive them as the government and, therefore, the potential provider of taxpayers' money to them; and we receive them as the regulator. We receive them in those three capacities. It is fundamentally absurd that the second-largest company in Australia should be in the majority ownership of the government. It is quite impossible over the longer term to do justice to those three obligations. That is one of the reasons why -  - The Leader of the Opposition works himself into confected outrage on behalf of the very mums and dads he tried to deny a tax cut to only two months ago. That is how much he cares about the mums and dads of Australia - the very mums and dads of Australia who have enjoyed a 15 per cent real wage increase. I will tell him about the mums and dads of Australia!</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for her question and for the interest she shows in this issue. I said earlier that there were two people we were particularly concerned about - one was a 37-year-old cameraman from Queensland who now lives in New York, who went down to New Orleans apparently to cover the hurricane for the media. We understand now, and are pleased to report, that he is safe and well, and we have that information from his partner. In relation to 30-year-old Ashley McDonald from Victoria, we have been particularly concerned about him, but police and our consular officials believe that he may have been located in Baton Rouge and been traced to a motel through credit card details. A friend who was at the hotel has also testified to his staying at the hotel, although he is not at the hotel at present. So we hope that, before long, we will be able finally to confirm that Ashley McDonald is safe and well. The indication is that he has been at the hotel in Baton Rouge for quite some days, and he did not notify people of this. We will have to wait and see, but that seems to be the case. In addition to that, we know of five Australian long-term residents of New Orleans who may still be in the affected area, but we do expect that those five have been evacuated.Since 1996, this government has put a very high priority on continually increasing our consular services. We have introduced a 24-hour consular emergency centre, an interdepartmental emergency task force for managing a whole-of-government response to consular crises and an emergency call unit. We have set up emergency response teams at short notice worldwide and we can quickly respond to consular crises, as we have done with 44 consular crises over the last 14 months, seven of which required the 24-hour crisis centre to be stood up.Australians make more than four million overseas trips every year. We help around 15,000 travellers and we also, sadly, help families return the remains of about 600 people who have died overseas. Australians need to appreciate that, when overseas, they are leaving behind our laws, they are leaving behind our emergency service capabilities and they are leaving behind our medical facilities. It is important that every traveller takes responsibility to minimise risks, as there are strict limits to what we can do in times of difficulty. Consular functions are governed by international agreements, and the Australian government cannot impose its laws, rules or standards on other countries.The Leader of the Opposition made some suggestions the other day as to what we should do, and of course they have been roundly ridiculed by the Australian community, and quite rightly so. Let me make this clear: the government cannot - and by the way the government would not want to - instruct our consular officers to break the laws of foreign countries. Let me also say that we will not instruct them to ignore and overrule local authorities who are coordinating major disaster and rescue plans and in doing so put those consular officers themselves in very great danger. That would be an absurd thing to do, although it has been recommended by the Leader of the Opposition. For what it is worth, we would not instruct our Defence Force personnel to free-range their way into disaster areas and run Rambo style rescue missions without the support of proper command.It is as simple as this: we would not put in place the irresponsible and dangerous plans that have been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition. As I said yesterday, if anyone in this House, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, aspires to be the Prime Minister of Australia, he should aspire to a bit of balance and wisdom, and the Leader of the Opposition has certainly shown himself to be well short of that.</DOC>

 - I might need an extension of time before my answer is fully completed. I thank the honourable member for his question. With regard to the latter part of his question, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced yesterday that it had commenced an investigation into Telstra, and ASIC is working with the Australian Stock Exchange on that matter. The continuous disclosure obligations applying to Telstra are contained in the listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Corporations Act 2001, and naturally it will be a matter for ASIC to determine whether contraventions of the Corporations Act have in fact occurred.As to the comment of Telstra management in recent times, the Prime Minister has dealt with this. He made it abundantly clear yesterday that a director's duty, which applies to all corporations in Australia, is not to knowingly talk down a company's interests. Telstra have a good story to tell, and I think we would all like to see them telling it. -  - The management have a duty to create value and help Telstra grow, and I think everybody would appreciate management's focus on these issues. - Remember that Telstra, like all incumbent and established telecommunications companies around the world, is facing a number of challenges. Competition is taking hold because of new technology and the government's regulatory and policy framework. It is competition that is the greatest challenge to Telstra, not anything else.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her interest in this matter, particularly in regional aviation. It is also significant to note that these days we have in Parliament House the Tourism and Transport Forum. I note that many representatives from the forum are seated in the gallery today. This is perhaps the leading gathering of leaders in this particular industry, and they are talking about some of the key issues associated with tourism and transport. Associated with their forum, they have released a survey which demonstrates a resounding vote of confidence in the level of security measures being implemented in the Australian transport system.It is very important that there be a perception of a high degree of safety, to encourage tourists and other visitors to come to this country. The TTF survey shows that 94 per cent of respondents believe that overseas tourists view Australia as a safe holiday destination. I think that is a resounding vote of confidence and it reflects well on the industry, government and others who have been working so hard to put in place a regime to guarantee that level of safety. That is part of the reason that we are breaking records in relation to international tourist arrivals and domestic air travellers. The honourable member would be particularly pleased that that has helped bring about the result of Rex airlines returning to profitability and there being a higher degree of confidence in the sector. So I would certainly compliment the industry on the effort it has put in.The government has provided $162 million for aviation security upgrades, tighter passenger and carry-on baggage screening, the hardening of cockpit doors and armed air security officers on many flights, and of course there has been some special funding for regional areas. It is important that this perception of safety be reinforced by everybody in the industry. So it has been disappointing to note some members opposite, and other people in prominent positions, trying to talk down the level of safety and security in our industry and undermine the improvements that have been made.The Leader of the Opposition, for instance, on his accident-prone visit to Gladstone last week, claimed that Australia did not have security checks on foreign seafarers coming into this country. That statement is simply wrong. Before ships even arrive in this country, the Office of Transport Security has undertaken a risk assessment of each ship, its cargo and its crew - including checking all of the relevant alert lists. And then there are the immigration checks to verify the crew information at the first port of call. There is a checking mechanism, and the Leader of the Opposition was simply wrong and mischief-making in an attempt to try and undermine public confidence in security.And what about the Independent member in the area of Mildura, Mr Savage, who is constantly trying to talk down the security at Mildura airport - suggesting that unscreened passengers are able, flying out of Mildura, to avoid screening when they arrive at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne? That is simply impossible. It is not physically possible, with the design of the terminal, to get from those areas into the secure areas. That kind of mischief making and those sorts of attempts to undermine the public confidence in our airport security are the sorts of things that will discourage visitors from coming to Australia. We need to work constructively on airport security and on safety and transport systems. We know there is more work to be done, but let us make sure that the public confidence in the system is encouraged and not undermined by silly rumours and by crying wolf.</DOC>

 - I have to say that, if the Leader of the Opposition always took the advice of the Australian Financial Review, he would be in a lot of trouble - in terms of his own performance, not the perspicacity of the Financial Review. I have read that editorial and I repeat what I said yesterday. Let me say again to the House what I said yesterday: I think it is the obligation of senior executives of Telstra to talk up the company's interests, not to talk them down. I hold by that view. I think the discharge of that obligation is entirely consistent with telling the truth - an accurate reporting to the market in those circumstances where there is an obligation to report to the market.What the Leader of the Opposition cannot avoid is the reality that over the last 48 hours it has become apparent that one of the fundamental arguments we advanced for the sale of Telstra - that is, the conflict of interest in which the government finds itself as a funding provider, as the principal shareholder and as the regulator - has to be resolved. Unless it is resolved -  - Let me say again to the House, and I have absolutely no reluctance to say this: I think it is the obligation of senior executives of Telstra to talk up the company's interests, not to talk them down. That is entirely compatible with telling the truth -  - because it is in the interests of the company that the truth be told. Apparently the one person who does not understand that is the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that, in terms of the government's reform agenda, today is an historic day because the Senate has finally passed the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. This is a bill which, for once and for all, will lead to the stamping out of the lawlessness, the corruption and, in some cases - regrettably - the criminal activity that occurs in the building and construction industry in Australia. It has been estimated that this activity costs the economy of Australia some $2.3 billion and that stamping this activity out can lead to an increase of one per cent in the GDP of the nation and a one per cent reduction in the inflation rate in this country.The passage of this bill has been welcomed. For example, today the Australian Industry Group said, 'The passage of the bill is a vital reform measure to address the damaging industrial practices plaguing parts of the industry.' The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says, 'The Australian economy will benefit if the industry can eliminate inefficient work practices, increase work force participation and contractual freedom, and improve compliance with the rule of order.' The Master Builders Association also welcomed the changes. Mr Harnisch, from the MBA, said, 'A well-empowered third party to ensure that 'stand and deliver' intimidation is removed from the industrial landscape is the central platform in increasing productivity' - which has been estimated to be at least $2.3 billion per annum. The Housing Industry Association has said: 'These new laws are even-handed and apply to everyone. No longer will businesses have reason to fear agreements made by others behind closed doors being imposed on them and their workers.'When this government came to office in 1996, it identified a number of industries that needed reform - the waterfront, the black coal industry, the red meat industry, the automotive industry and the building industry. Each of those reforms has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. Remember the opposition from the Labor Party and the union movement to reform of the Australian waterfront, and yet we have now seen an increase in productivity where the container rate is some 28 containers per hour. We have seen a 72 per cent increase in productivity in the black coal industry, and it is now one of the country's largest exporting industries. There has been a substantial increase in productivity in the red meat industry, and we are currently working with the automotive industry in this country to improve productivity in that industry. Why? Because this is about jobs and wages for ordinary Australians. These reforms have been important, yet the Labor Party and the union movement have fought them tooth and nail on every occasion. This is about significant economic advancement for Australia. It is about doing the things that need to be done to ensure that Australian workers and their families will continue to thrive in the future.</DOC>

 - This government has not misled the mum and dad shareholders. In fact, the mum and dad shareholders of Australia have no better friend than this government. In fact, if the member for Melbourne would pause for a moment he would understand that, under this government, there has been a surge in the aggregate number of mum and dad shareholders. Under this government, Australia can boast having become a major shareholder. The reality is that the government has been open about its policy in relation to Telstra. We have always said that it was our policy to sell down our majority ownership, and we have had dramatic demonstrations, in the past few days, of how very desirable in public policy terms it is that we end this ridiculous conflict of interest that works against the interests of the very mum and dad shareholders for whom the Leader of the Opposition feigns compassion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. He, along with the member for Braddon, is giving powerful representation to Northern Tasmania. Before the last election, the Prime Minister announced that the government, if returned, would - in addition to every other dollar that it provides to government and non-government schools throughout Australia - provide an additional $1 billion directly to schools for the projects that parents themselves think are important. A total of $700 million of that will be delivered directly to the P&amp;Cs and school councils of government schools supported by school principals.I can say to the member for Bass - and also the member for Braddon - and can advise the House that at this stage we have had 177 applications from Tasmania. We have 8,500 government schools throughout Australia that have applied for funding for everything, from electrical and heating equipment - which is this case at Scottsdale High School -  - We have the legendary campaign from the member for Dobell to get the toilets fixed at the Tuggerawong public school. We know that the Deanmore public school in the electorate of Stirling desperately needs play equipment. I think we are fixing up the library at Sandringham East. With these 8½ thousand applications, we have already announced -  - the projects for the Northern Territory and the ACT. All of the projects will be announced before the end this month, with the exception of New South Wales, where the projects will be announced by mid-October.It is very interesting that, as I am attempting to advise the House of the facts in relation to school funding, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is whingeing and screaming out, 'Where is it? What's happened to the funding?' and so on. We are in a situation where the government, less than one year after its re-election, is delivering more than $145 million directly into school projects. But take the state of New South Wales. Why are they called state schools? Because they are owned, operated, administered and primarily funded by the states. Yet the New South Wales government this year has cut the funding for its capital works by $6 million and frozen its maintenance, and we have not heard from the Labor Party a single word of criticism of any of the states and territories for starving state schools. There are many differences between this government and the opposition in relation to schools. This government has a help list that has 8,500 schools on it that will be receiving up to $150,000 for urgently needed school projects. The Labor Party has a hit list. We give money to schools; the Labor Party takes it away.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no, but let me point out to the honourable gentleman that I am advised that there are many examples where companies pay dividends that are higher than their reported profit in a particular year and so have paid out of reserves. Indeed, I am further advised that 14 of our top 100 companies are currently paying dividends that exceed their latest reported annual earnings. The most well-known of these would be Suncorp Metway, Linter, Seven, Telecom NZ and Paperlin X. The reality is that the member for Melbourne, like the Leader of the Opposition, is totally out of his depth on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. The Australian people are right to be concerned about the extent of poor health amongst Indigenous people but wrong to think that the situation is going from bad to worse, because it is not. The latest report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that, in the decade to 2002, Indigenous mortality rates have declined by some 25 per cent in Western Australia and have declined even more sharply in South Australia. That is on top of a 60 per cent decline in the mortality rate from communicable diseases and a 30 per cent decline in the mortality rate from trauma in the Northern Territory since the 1970s.Since 1996 Indigenous-specific health spending by the Commonwealth government has increased from about $100 million to over $350 million a year. Since 1996 the number of Aboriginal medical services has increased from 108 to 152. There has been a 74 per cent increase in the volume of health services being delivered to Indigenous people. There has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous nurses and there has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous doctors. So, while there is still a long way to go, the Commonwealth government certainly takes its responsibilities seriously, and considerable progress is being made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question because I know of his interest in native title issues, representing as he does an area of Australia with a very significant Indigenous population. Of course, the government is committed to achieving better outcomes for all parties involved in native title issues. The increasing number of native title determinations and agreements shows the system is working now, but it is still too costly and very time consuming. I am pleased to announce today a package of more practical reforms that are aimed at making the native title system work more effectively and efficiently.The reforms are not about challenging the fundamental principles of native title - nor are we seeking to wind back native title rights - but they will focus very much on making agreements rather than litigation. They will be aimed at improving all elements of the system, including the effectiveness of native title representative bodies and, I might say, respondent funding. They will involve minor and technical amendments to improve the operation of the Native Title Act. We will be reviewing how the Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court can work more closely and effectively together in managing and resolving native title claims. We will also be playing a role in encouraging state and territory governments to adopt more transparent practices to resolve native title issues.There will of course be extensive consultation with all the stakeholders, and to that end we want to ensure that the reforms are fully understood and that stakeholder concerns are taken into account. I will be arranging to meet with state ministers with responsibility in this area to talk through with them how they can play a constructive role in moving these issues forward. Following that consultation, I will announce further details, but I firmly believe that Indigenous Australians should have the opportunity to have their proper entitlements to land realised during their lifetimes. The problem with the system we have now is that for many that is unlikely to be achieved. These practical reforms will provide better outcomes and increased certainty to all participants in the native title system and in a more timely way.</DOC>

 - I do not of course accept the interpretation that the Leader of the Opposition has placed upon the government's conduct. Could I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if we have an ideological obsession with selling Telstra then he had an ideological obsession with selling the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas - exactly the same thing. Our commitment to selling Telstra, which we have been honest enough to lay before the Australian people on four occasions, is based upon a realistic understanding that if you want a competitive telecommunications market you can no longer burden the largest participant with government ownership. The greatest burden imposed on Telstra by the government is not regulation but majority government ownership, and it is in the long-term interests - and the Leader of the Opposition might bear this in mind when he seeks the suspension of standing orders in a moment -  - That's right - got him! The body language is all there. Let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: this is not ideology; it is a commodity the Australian people know and understand - that is, old-fashioned commonsense.</DOC>

 - The government will examine any serious allegation of profiteering, and if a reference to the ACCC is likely to produce something beneficial to the public that reference will occur. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the cause of high petrol prices is the high price of oil. Any attempt to argue otherwise by the Leader of the Opposition flies in the face, amongst other things, of the arguments of the chairman of the caucus economic committee, the honourable member for Rankin. Writing in the Age on 20 July this year, this is what Dr Emerson had to say:Australia's record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only - high world oil prices.I say to the motorists of Australia and to the Australian public that I fully understand their anger at the price of petrol. I wish it were lower. I do not take this matter lightly. I sympathise with them. I am glad that strong economic conditions mean that the pain of high petrol prices is not as great as it might otherwise have been. But I am not going to mislead them. I am not going to pretend that by having an inquiry, by setting up a committee or by referring this to some other body we will miraculously be able to bring the price down.I notice that some of the state premiers are running around saying, 'Something has got to be done.' If they collectively can control the supply of world crude oil and if they collectively can do something to bring down the price of world crude oil, I will convene a weekend meeting of the Council of Australian Governments and take their advice. I will put off anything to hear their views. I doubt that they will seriously pretend that they can do other than posture and score political points. This is not something for political point-scoring.I say to my fellow Australians: if there were a way that I could bring down the price of petrol I would move heaven and earth to do so. But I cannot do that, and I am not going to pretend I can with some kind of gimmick or artifice or by having some kind of pretend inquiry - we have had probably a hundred or more inquiries into the price of petrol over the last 20 years. It just demonstrates the barren policy alternatives of the Leader of the Opposition that he would pretend otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. The employment figures released this morning show a very strong picture of the Australian labour market. They show that, over the last 12 months, there have been 400,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy. That is the largest number of jobs created in a 12-month period - not since 1978, not in the last 30 years but in the whole of Australia's recorded history. We have never had a 12-month period when more jobs have been created. With 400,000 new jobs in the last 12 months, this is the largest 12-month increase in new jobs ever achieved.There have now been 1.7 million new jobs created since the government has been in office. In August our unemployment rate remained at five per cent. This is a 30-year low that comes off the back of yesterday's growth figures, which show that the Australian economy is now growing very strongly off the back of strong business investment and an improvement in Australia's terms of trade.The striking feature of this morning's figures, and it was alluded to by the member for Goldstein in his question, is that the participation rate is now at a record high of 64.8 per cent. That means that people are confident about getting a job. It means that more people than ever are trying to get into the labour market. It means that we are living in an era which is beneficial for the employees. This is an employees' market; it is not a bosses' market. It is a workers' market, because there are opportunities such as there have never been before. This is a workers' market the likes of which this country has not seen since the end of World War II. This is coming off the back of a very strong economy.So I say to the working men and women of Australia, as I said to them yesterday when we recorded those wonderful growth figures, that I thank them for the contribution they have made to the strong labour market. I thank them for their adaptability, for their dedication, for their commitment, for their cooperative attitude and for the willingness of the working men and women of Australia to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the Australia of 2005. This is a golden age for Australian working men and women. I am very pleased indeed that they are getting the benefits of it. They are getting higher wages. They are getting lower taxes. They have low interest rates. They have more job opportunities, and I am only too pleased that they are able to enjoy the benefits of that economic situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I think all honourable members know of his background, experience and interest in matters relating to the protection of our community. I think he knows as well as anybody else in this House that we cannot afford to be complacent on these issues. Our terrorism laws have so far proven to be effective, resulting in the arrest and conviction of a number of people here in Australia. However, terrorists have shown that they are, if anything, resourceful, innovative and determined, and we have to make sure, in relation to our laws, that we stay one step ahead of them.Following the terrorist attacks in London, I asked my department to work with law enforcement and security agencies to examine whether there were further legislative reforms that would enable Australia to prevent or respond to an attack here. I am pleased to say that my colleagues have today endorsed in principle these wide-ranging and well-targeted proposals.I would like to touch on some of these key reforms. Australia has in place specific powers of detention: detention for intelligence and security purposes and detention for the purposes of investigating an offence - also referred to as arrest. I am concerned that there could be incidents where intelligence is available that a person will be involved in an imminent terrorist attack but the criteria for detention under existing legislation have not been satisfied. The ability of the United Kingdom police to detain individuals without arresting them was instrumental in the resolution of investigations in relation to the recent London bombings. These powers facilitated law enforcement in identification and location of individuals involved in the attacks. With that in mind, we will create a new detention regime with a preventive focus that will complement existing regimes. Under this, police would be authorised to detain a person for up to 24 hours, with scope for extension for a further 24 hours. We will be inviting states to consider, within their competency, whether longer periods might be able to be put in place by them.We are also increasingly concerned - and I think it is a concern that many in the community share - that conduct by people sympathetic to terrorist activities is in many ways seditious in nature. That is why we will introduce laws to replace the existing sedition offence in the Crimes Act with a new offence in the Criminal Code: 'inciting violence against the community'. Other amendments will require airlines flying into or operating in Australia to provide certain information to law enforcement and security agencies and will make it an offence to leave baggage unattended within an airport precinct. We will be introducing a new measure, termed a control order, as well as a new system of notice to produce. Drafting of these amendments has already commenced and they will be introduced into the parliament as a matter of priority. I certainly hope they will have the support not only of this side of the House but also of the members opposite.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated that the Telstra Corporation Act effectively provided a prohibition on the disclosure.

I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that, for so long as I hold an office under the Crown, I will not actively seek to break the law of this country, unlike the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Solomon and remind the House that he does an excellent job for the people of Darwin as their representative. Tomorrow, 9 September, is the first anniversary of the bombing that took place outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. That was the first terrorist attack there had been on an Australian diplomatic mission. It is worth remembering on this occasion that 10 innocent Indonesians were killed in that attack and over 200 people were injured. We do reflect on the sad loss to the victims' families and on the bravery of those who attended the wounded in the aftermath. Memorial ceremonies will be held tomorrow in both Jakarta and Canberra. Our thoughts are also with those people who are still recovering. In particular, it is worth remembering Manny Musu, who suffered horrific injuries and lost her mother in the attack. I understand that she is still undergoing surgery. She has to undergo further surgery a year later in Italy where she now lives. I do commend the courage of Manny and her family, as she faces yet another operation.More broadly, the government are very deeply engaged in efforts to counter terrorism in our region. We have memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism with a number of countries in the region. We have a comprehensive, proactive and strategic approach to working closely with neighbouring countries to apprehend and prosecute terrorists, and we are making good progress. We welcome the convictions of two people who played a role in the embassy bombing, and there are trials of four other people under way. In two of those trials, the prosecutors are calling for the death penalty. All 36 of those people who have been tried for the Bali bombings in 2002 have been convicted, and I remind the House that three of those people have been sentenced to death and four have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Over 300 Jemaah Islamiah members and other terrorists have also been detained.I particularly pay tribute to the Australian Federal Police for the work they have been doing with the Indonesians, specifically with the Indonesian police, in pursuing Jemaah Islamiah and their various allies. We are continuing to build counterterrorism cooperation with the countries of our region and that was illustrated in the recent May budget. One of our significant achievements in the region is the establishment of the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation with the Indonesians, which came from the counterterrorism summit that we and the Indonesians cohosted at the beginning of last year.I think Australia is doing an extraordinarily good job in helping countries in the region counter terrorism. Progress has been made. The problem is not solved. There are still people out there who we seek to apprehend. There are still dangers and risks of further terrorist attacks, but nevertheless good progress has been made. We should remember that - as well as the victims of the embassy bombing of 9 September last year - over the course of tomorrow.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no. The answer to the first part of the question is for me to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the legal obligation of disclosure of relevant information is a legal obligation that rests on the company - not only under express provision of the Corporations Act; it is also an obligation that rests on the company. Any expert in this area would be able to tell the Leader of the Opposition, and any company director or executive worth his or her salt would know, that the obligation of full disclosure of relevant information is an obligation owed by the company directly to the Stock Exchange. It is not an obligation which is discharged by giving information to the government, and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has said alters the strength of what I have said in answer to earlier questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. Of course, the member for Maranoa will be well aware of the investment of in excess of $1 billion that the government has already made over a number of years in regional telecommunications in Australia. The reason we have done that is that regional exporters depend on good, modern telecommunications systems to be able to compete effectively in the international marketplace. Of course, the package that the government has put forward - the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package - will deliver further fast, reliable telecommunications services to regional Australia. The member for Maranoa has been integral in the development of this package, along with other members of the government.In the future, with modern technology and an ability to roll that technology out, even small regional exporters will be able to track the temperature and condition of their products all the way from the farm gate through to supermarkets in overseas countries. But it will only be possible if they have fast, reliable telecommunications. That is what the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package is all about: getting new technology out into regional Australia. It not only means investment in regional telecommunications; it also guarantees an income stream into the future in perpetuity to deliver new technologies that come online in the future.Along with the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package, the government have outlined their proposals to strengthen the customer service guarantee and increase customer compensation by 21 per cent under the CSG. We have also outlined that we are prepared to strengthen the network reliability framework. The Australian Communications and Media Authority will now be able to target sections of the copper network in small or less commercial exchange areas and require Telstra to upgrade at least 480 of these per year under the NRF. The government have outlined their intentions to introduce a licensing requirement that Telstra come forward with an effective local presence plan in regional Australia.The member for Maranoa asked about alternative policies. The reality is that, on regional telecommunications, there are no alternative policies coming from anywhere, particularly from the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately the Australian Labor Party are not interested in regional telecommunications. If the Australian Labor Party and their fellow travellers were really interested in improving services in regional Australia, they would support the government's proposals to invest $3.1 billion in regional telecommunications.</DOC>

 - In response to the question, I point out to the member for New England that the government have taken advice from all different quarters, and particularly public advice that is on the public record with regard to the status and the standard of the infrastructure in telecommunications across Australia. We have also taken advice from consumers across regional Australia, and particularly advice from some of the organisations that represent those constituents across Australia.I can point out to the member for New England the published statistics as far as the issue that he raises - faults - is concerned. This is published by the ACMA. Telstra publicly reports monthly on the percentage of services which were at fault. The published statistics by the ACMA show that 99 per cent of services were fault-free in July 2005. This is the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the regulator, which publicly releases information every three months on fault repair and reports annually on actual numbers of faults. Our focus is on providing all Australians with reliable, high-quality services. We achieved this by setting tough regulatory arrangements such as the USO, the CSG, the network reliability framework and price controls. These things did not exist under the Labor government. The member for New England will be well aware of that.I will just quote some more statistics to him. The latest fault repair time performance figures show that 91 per cent of telephone faults were repaired within the CSG time frame in the last quarter. This is three per cent higher than the same quarter in 2004. To give you an idea of how Telstra's performance has improved in recent years, back in 1998, when our government introduced the customer service guarantee, Telstra was repairing just 70 per cent of telephone faults on time. So there has been a 20 per cent improvement from 1998 to the present day. They are the published statistics and terms of fault repairs as far as the government is concerned, and they are the statistics we have been working on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question and for his interest in the work that we do on these issues. First, let me just say that I am sure all Australians will be interested to hear that Ashley McDonald, who had been missing and whose credit card details had been traced to a motel in Baton Rouge, has now been found. The Australian Federal Police visited him at a correctional facility south of Baton Rouge. He is safe and well, and a consular officer will be providing him with consular assistance. So all of the Australians about whom we have had concerns have now been found.Secondly, I am pleased to say that we have now located the last five Australians who are permanent residents of New Orleans. They are accounted for. So all Australians whom we know about, through contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or through other methods, have been accounted for. It is an opportunity for me to thank very warmly on behalf of the government - and I know all members on this side would join me in thanking them - those consular officials and AFP officers who have worked tirelessly and often without very much sleep as they have attempted to track down Australians and assist them when those Australians have been caught up in Hurricane Katrina. I particularly want to mention our Consul General in Washington, John McAnulty; Amanda Hodges, Justin Biggs and Chris Sheehan in Baton Rouge; Michael Corbitt, Craig Pheeney, Peta Hudson and Nana Booker in Houston; James Hazell in San Antonio; and also the officers in the consular branch back here in Canberra.The honourable member also asked about assistance for the United States. The Prime Minister announced the other day that we would provide $10 million to the American Red Cross. The Red Cross has helped to shelter more than 145,000 evacuees in more than 580 shelters across 17 states, so I think our contribution is timely. As the Prime Minister and I have both said, America always comes to the help of countries which run into difficulties around the world. I think that for us to provide assistance to America at this difficult time is only appropriate and is a nice gesture from Australia. To show that we appreciate what America has done for so many over the years in times of crisis, we should come to help them when they themselves hit a crisis.We are in discussions with US authorities regarding possible further assistance that we could provide. One possibility is that we will assist with disaster victim identification - an area, sadly, where we have built up a good deal of expertise coming out of the Bali bombing and the tsunami. We are looking at providing public health and medical assistance, incident management capability and recovery planning and coordination, and we would consider further requests over and above those areas of an in-kind type.The last point I want to make is that we have been out there helping a lot of Australians, but it is worth reminding everybody that, ultimately, Australians do need to be prepared to take responsibility for their own actions when they are travelling - to read the travel advisories, to listen to local warnings and to make sure that they take responsibility for themselves. We will always do what we can when they get into difficulties. We will work tirelessly to help them if they get into trouble, but there are obviously limits to what officers can do. I notice, by the way, that the Leader of the Opposition has not commented on this issue since his blunder on Monday. - Perhaps it was Tuesday morning's Today program; perhaps that was the last time he spoke about it. I would make this request, and that is that the Leader of the Opposition might quietly, away from publicity, write to the ambassador in Washington and to my department offering an apology for some of the things he said.</DOC>

 - The answer to that part of the question is no. We think it is a great outcome for regional Australia to have a $2 billion fund locked in, in perpetuity, that is going to continue to deliver an income stream so there will always be certainty in the ability of future governments to invest in regional telecommunications.</DOC>

 - I am grateful that the member for Kingston has been studying health policy today as well as attending the National Youth Roundtable, some of whose members are here. I am not surprised that the member for Kingston is interested in this because, thanks to the policies of the Howard government, there has been a 13.9 per cent increase in the GP bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Kingston. Since 1996 health spending has risen from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget and federal health spending has risen from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. But it is not the quantity of the spending that counts, it is the quality of the outcomes, and thanks to the government's policy there are 30 per cent more medical students in training in our universities, there are 30 per cent more GPs in training and the national bulk-billing rate has now reached almost 75 per cent.I have been asked about alternative policies. The policy of the shadow minister for health is something called Medicare Gold. She is totally committed to Medicare Gold, even though the former chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition has called it 'a strategic disaster'; Peter Botsman, the Labor intellectual, has called it 'a hoax'; and Barry Jones, the Labor Party's national president, has called it 'a turkey'. We have the member for Melbourne, the born-again frontbencher, saying that Medicare Gold would 'add a very substantial -  - Let me point out to the member for Chifley that, thanks to the policies of the Howard government, he has 98 per cent GP bulk-billing in his electorate. The member for Melbourne said of Medicare Gold, 'It would add a very substantial burden to future budgets.' Just on Sunday, Mungo MacCallum, who is not exactly a cheerleader for the Howard government, said of Medicare Gold, 'It would distort the economy for decades.' I think the Leader of the Opposition, deep down, understands that, because he said in January, 'Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark.' Unlike the member for Lalor, the Leader of the Opposition said that Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark. That is quite interesting because -  - Mark is coming back in a big way in a couple of weeks time. We will all be talking about Mark in a couple of weeks time. It is quite interesting -  - Medicare Gold might have disappeared with Mark, but just today I looked at the web site and what did I find? - I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition is getting increasingly confused, because he said in January that Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark. I went onto the web site this morning, and what did I find? I found that Labor advocates a Medicare Gold style solution. Take a look at this Leader of the Opposition. On Monday he wants to invade America, but he is too weak to get Medicare Gold off his web site. He reckons he can invade America on Monday, and he cannot even get Medicare Gold off his web site. I tell you this, Mr Speaker: if you cannot control your own party you will never be allowed to control the country.</DOC>

Since he knows so much about the proposal that he read in the paper, he would also realise that the $5.7 billion proposal asked for $2.6 billion from the government, and it was not just for regional Australia. Did I tell my colleagues? Yes, I did. We have put together a package that in the short term and the longer term will provide certainty and security of investment in telecommunications in regional Australia - a hell of a lot more than the Labor Party has ever done for regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I can inform him and honourable members that the Australian Social Attitudes: The First Report published this week revealed the enormous confidence that Australians have in the economy today. It revealed that 80 per cent Australians are now proud of Australia's economic performance and, importantly, it revealed that 88 per cent of  respondents - that is, almost nine respondents in 10 - felt secure in their jobs and did not fear losing them in the next 12 months. What that reveals is what the Prime Minister indicated earlier in question time - that is, in Australia today we have a workers' market.This is in stark contrast to where we were a bit over a decade ago. In fact, back in 1992, Roy Morgan Research showed that only 65 per cent of workers felt secure in their jobs and 32 per cent of Australian workers feared unemployment. Those were the days when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister in the previous government. Of course, that was a time when we had one million unemployed Australians. In May 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, he said about the unemployment rate:Where it is now is unacceptable; where it's going to is even more unacceptable.This is a stark contrast between what we had under the Labor Party policies of the past and the policies of this government over the last 9½ years. What we have seen is the growth of 1.7 million extra jobs in 9½ years in Australia. And the important thing about this, as revealed in the statistics today, is that of those 1.7 million extra jobs in Australia almost one million have been full-time jobs. So we have gone from a situation under the Labor Party of a million unemployed to a situation of a million extra full-time jobs in Australia over the last 9½ years. In addition to that, the jobs growth has not just been isolated to the urban areas of Australia. Indeed, the jobs growth has been just as strong in the non-metropolitan areas as it has been in the cities, and in fact the income inequality in Australia has narrowed over that period of 9½ years.The further balanced, sensible, incremental workplace reforms which this government is proposing will help us to consolidate those gains. Australians - and Australian workers in particular - have nothing to fear about further incremental changes to workplace relations, any more than they had anything to fear when we made changes back in 1996. Under these changes there is a way in which we can ensure that in the future there will be further jobs growth, and Australians and their families will be better off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What I can confirm is that we have not sold anybody out. What I can also confirm is that for the first time there is going to be the largest investment in regional telecommunications in the history of Australia. Not only are we proposing to put forward $3.1 billion worth of investments for infrastructure but also we are proposing to strengthen the network reliability framework so 480 of those cable runs are replaced every year as a licence condition. When did the Australian Labor Party ever address any of these issues? They did not, and they did not do it when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for Telstra in the time of the Labor government. Our government has put down a full package to address investment, to address competition and to address regulation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and his commitment to plain speaking for the people of Braddon. I announced early this year that there would be a national inquiry into reading, and its chairman, Dr Ken Rowe, whom I met earlier this week and who will soon present me with a report, informs me that one in four Australian children will leave the Australian school system unable to read and communicate effectively with fundamental errors in grammar, punctuation and spelling. There are many reasons for that, but one of them is the language-neutered jargonistic report cards that parents have been receiving at home about the school performance of their children. They have left many parents, who might themselves be educationally disadvantaged, in the dark as to how their kids are actually going.One of the conditions that the Howard government has placed on school funding, in a determination to drive national consistency and lift standards in this regard, is that there will be plain language reporting to parents as a condition of funding to any school that wants to receive Australian government funding. From next year, schools, whatever method they use, will report A, B, C, D or E. In addition to that, the schools will be required to tell parents where their child is going in relation to the rest of the class. I am pleased to inform the House that the states of New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania have agreed to that. Also Victoria and South Australia have agreed to A, B, C, D, E and, in addition, they will place a statement on the report that advises parents that they can receive the ranking of their child on request from the school.The sort of nonsense that we are having to deal with, which the member for Braddon and Bass know only too well, is reflected in what the Tasmanian Department of Education is doing with a thing called 'Essential Learnings'. In fact, when I discussed 'Essential Learnings' with the Tasmanian Minister for Education a few weeks ago I said, 'Do you mean 'subjects'?' For example, parents are being told whether their child is being literate, and I actually had to say to the minister, 'Do you mean reading and writing?' Don Watson, who was a former speech writer for Mr Keating when he was the Prime Minister - he has written a few books about jargon - has described this nonsense:It is a language not unlike Stalinist language in being totally abstract.You cannot consult the community in this language because the community does not speak it. You might as well consult in Swahili. As a typical example, the Tasmanian Department of Education have produced a jargon buster to explain to parents what their jargon means. One of their jargons that they want to put on school reports is called a 'concept plan'. The jargon buster, in part, says that a concept plan:... illustrates concepts and the relationships between them. The links are indicated by words that specify the relationship between two or more concepts.What on earth does that mean to the average parent? There would not be a member of this House that would understand that. Hang on, I suspect there is one member of the House who does understand that kind of language because he speaks it every day - the Leader of the Opposition. From next year parents will get plain language reports. They will know exactly how their kids are going and we will lift the standards of education in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. There is no more enthusiastic and effective supporter of the resources sector in this House than the member for Kalgoorlie. I congratulate him on his lunch today for the Friends of Resources, which is actually starting to rival the Friends of Tourism lunch in terms of attracting interest from our members.The resources sector continues to power the nation's economy and figures released this week by ABARE show that the mineral and energy exports sector earnings rose some 29 per cent in 2004-05 to $67.4 billion. In terms of individual commodities, coking coal exports are up 65 per cent to $10.7 billion, LNG is up 47 per cent to $3 billion and iron ore and pellets are up 53 per cent to $8 billion. This is an extraordinarily impressive performance by anyone's standards, but we should not rest on our laurels in Australia.This global surge in resource prices also includes uranium. There is a real opportunity to ensure that Australia makes the most of the fact that it has 41 per cent of the world's deposits, yet currently exports only 21 per cent of the world's demand. It is an opportunity begging with uranium prices at a 20-year high and expected to climb further. This government is determined to see export opportunities maximised and in doing so, of course, to pay due heed to the environmental, Indigenous safety and non-proliferation safeguard issues.I am asked about alternative views. The greatest export bottleneck in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. When it comes to uranium, they have a stack of different views. We have the opposition leader, of course, who says that they have a three-mines policy; we have the South Australian Treasurer, Kevin Foley, who says the policy is idiotic; and, in the middle, we have the member for Batman, who says that Labor does not have a three-mines policy and, in fact, that bans on uranium mines are silly. The Labor Party has a three-mines policy - but it is 'mined' with a 'd'. They are all over the place on this issue and, at a time when they are calling for extra exports, this attitude on uranium is sheer hypocrisy. In contrast to the Labor Party's incompetence, this government will continue to boost exports, provide jobs and ensure economic growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and acknowledge her interest in aged care issues in her electorate. I am pleased to confirm to the member and to the House that the Howard government is on track to meet its 2001 election commitment for 200,000 operational aged care places by 30 June next year. In fact, as at 30 June this year there were 193,753 operational aged care places in Australia. A further 11,000 places will be allocated this year through the 2005 round. This means that there has been an increase of almost 40 per cent across Australia since the Howard government came to office, and in some electorates that has been even higher. For example, in Richmond there has been a 50 per cent increase in operational aged care places.What this also means is that the Howard government has exceeded the planning benchmark, a benchmark that was set by Labor, for 100 operational aged care places per 1,000 people in the population over the age of 70. We have exceeded that benchmark and we have now set it higher to 108. Through significantly increased placements, through significant increases in funding and through a series of reforms, the Howard government is now ensuring that older Australians have access to more choice in aged care, better quality care, better homes, better models of service delivery and better skills in the work force.You have to compare Labor's woeful record in the area of aged care. Not only did they not once meet their own planning benchmark but they left office with a woeful record and a shortage of 10,000 places. That was a national scandal, and today the Labor Party still have no aged care policy and no ideas on how to meet the challenges of an ageing population. Meanwhile, the Howard government is working for older Australians to ensure that they have access to high-quality and affordable care.</DOC>

I assume he is referring to the joint press release between the Prime Minister and me in relation to measures that were announced last Thursday. As I recall, there was attached to that document some further elaboration. The point we have now reached is that after the discussion with state officials, involving Commonwealth officials that operate as a legal reference group, preparations are under way for the meeting to be held on 27 September, jointly involving the Prime Minister, premiers and territory leaders.The measures that we are pursuing will be advanced in those discussions with the leaders, and when that has been concluded and agreement is reached, because a number of these measures do require the willing engagement of the states and territories, drafting of the more detailed provisions will commence. Some consideration has been given already to that process, but as for the detailed legislation we will undertake the normal review that we would expect through the party room structures on this side of the House with time for your colleagues on that side of the House to also consider the matters and for parliamentary committee examinations as appropriate. We hope to get the passage of that legislation before the end of this year.</DOC>

 - As I think we were so properly reminded by the Acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, people across the world yesterday paused to remember the more than 3,000 innocent lives that were tragically lost on that date four years ago. Among the more than 3,000 lives taken were 10 of our fellow Australians. As we have seen recently in the city of London, the threat of terrorism remains very real and a very dangerous prospect.A video released overnight claiming to be issued by al-Qaeda has, for the first time, included a reference to an Australian city - Melbourne. Relevant agencies are currently assessing the statements made in the video, but at this stage indications are that it is authentic. But that does not mean that the statements in it are anything more than rhetoric. I can confirm American al-Qaeda convert Adam Gadahn, also known to security agencies here and overseas, has been said to be the author and participant. This would be his second-known video statement, the first being in October 2004. It also appeared on its face to be little more than anti-Western rhetoric. The information contained in the video does not provide any basis to change the threat levels to Australia or Australian interests overseas.Of course, al-Qaeda threats against Australia are not new. Australia has been mentioned previously in al-Qaeda statements and has been viewed as a potential target or a location for an attack well before the September 11 attacks. As the Prime Minister reminded us last week, our counter-terrorism laws are subject to regular review and, where appropriate, refinement and, as I have often said, remain an unfinished canvas.The legislative proposals that we announced last week were in response to law enforcement and security agencies examining whether more could be done to enable Australia to better respond to the threat of terrorism. As I said earlier, the details of the legislation are still being developed and will be subject to normal and appropriate levels of parliamentary scrutiny. But consistent with our approach to counter-terrorism laws, appropriate safeguards will be a feature of the new legislation, and I want to assure the Australian public that the legislative response will be commensurate to the threat - a threat which we are reminded of in a very unfortunate but nevertheless timely way today.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Australian government is treating this threat very seriously and the relevant agencies are currently assessing the statements made in the video. Security agencies such as ASIO and the AFP are working closely with their overseas counterparts to obtain further information about the tape and the people who made it. The video appears to be authentic, but that does not mean that the statements in it are any more than rhetoric. The American al-Qaeda convert Adam Gadahn is known to security agencies here and overseas. As the Attorney-General has also just indicated, we propose to introduce some new measures and we propose to work very closely with the states. We have announced over the last three or four years, as I mentioned earlier, $5.6 billion worth of investment in extra security measures following September 11 and other terrorist events that have taken place across the world. The government will continue to take decisions as and where it sees fit to ensure the security of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. I recognise her very keen interest in these matters, particularly the linkage, as far as poverty alleviation is concerned, between official overseas development aid and trade policy. Australia is delivering a message to the rest of the world, and that is that aid and trade liberalisation can lift millions of people out of poverty if targeted and engaged in properly. The Prime Minister is in New York at the UN world leaders summit. He will outline Australia's regional successes in terms of targeted aid. At the same time, he will encourage major players such as the European Union and the United States of America to reduce trade barriers, to allow the developing world access to their wealthier markets.We are approaching a crucial time as far as the Doha Round is concerned with a critical ministerial meeting to take place in December of this year in Hong Kong. We need to see more leadership from leading economies in the world to break the impasse, particularly over agriculture, because it is agricultural trade that initially allows the developing world access into those wealthier markets across the world. Of course, it is also very important for the Australian economy that we see an improvement in global agricultural trade. I welcome the comments from Prime Minister Tony Blair last week when he said, 'All countries stand to benefit from increased trade and the importance of poor country access to rich country markets.' We would say, 'More strength to his arm.' Prime Minister Blair needs to also convince his colleagues in the European Union about those objectives, as we continue to do. I welcome comments made by the EU Commissioner for External Trade, Peter Mandelson, that trade barriers are ineffective and only distract domestic industries from becoming competitive. This government is engaging both the EU and the US at this time to secure an agreement in Hong Kong.We should never underestimate the importance and the significance of a developed country like Australia strongly advocating trade-liberalising policies across the world for the benefit of the developing world and, at the same time, playing our role and discharging responsibilities as far as aid is concerned. The World Bank estimates that freeing up world trade and abolishing agricultural subsidies would boost global welfare by up to $240 billion a year and lift 140 million people out of poverty across the world by 2015. These are certainly objectives that are worth pursuing, and we as the Australian government are certainly going to maintain our engagement in pursuing those objectives.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. Of course farmers and primary producers understand the requirements of, and the necessity for, national security and the interests and safeguards that the government must pursue. I will certainly check the quote that the Leader of the Opposition seeks to throw at me, but I will not be taking it at face value because what my comments were directed at was that the cost impost not fall unfairly on one sector of the community over another. Consequently, how the issue of ammonium nitrate progresses, in what way and under what regulatory regime, particularly involving the states, is still being worked out, particularly as we look at other chemicals as well. Do not misunderstand my comments or the intent of agricultural sectors, which fully understand and accept their responsibilities in contributing to national security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Last week's national accounts figures showed that the Australian economy continued to strengthen in the June quarter, growing by 1.3 per cent to be 2.6 per cent higher through the year. When you consider the challenges we have had in the economy this year, that is particularly pleasing - challenges such as the trade weighted increase of the Australian dollar, which was eight per cent above its post-float average. There is also the challenge that world oil prices are now giving to the economy, with world oil prices, on average, now 45 per cent higher in 2004-05 than in 2003-04.The other feature of the national accounts which was pleasing is that, although we are seeing a moderation in household demand and dwelling investment, they showed a very strong growth in business investment. Business investment is what will drive growth in the future and increase the capacity of the Australian economy. The business investment results could be shown with a pick-up of seven per cent from the June quarter, to be 15 per cent higher over the year; new building investment, 13 per cent higher over the year; new machinery and equipment, 18 per cent higher than a year ago; and new engineering and construction rose by 18 per cent over the year. In nominal terms, businesses invested around $110 billion in 2004-05. Of that $110 billion, $10 billion was in the mining industry. As you can imagine, in response to high prices, new investment in the mining industry has gone in for bulk commodities. We will be increasing capacity in both the iron ore and the coal industry to take advantage of an appreciation in Australia's terms of trade and high mineral prices. So it is not just the growth in the national accounts; it is the quality of those national accounts, which shows that Australia is now investing and rebalancing growth, and that the export sector will be stronger in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - Under the government's Corporations Law changes in the CLERP 9 amendments that we put into the act, a company is required to put its remuneration policies to an annual general meeting. That goes to a non-binding resolution and, as I understand it, it is also done in arrears. If that is the case, at this year's annual general meeting it would be the remuneration practices applying in 2004-05.Having said that let me go on and say that a directors' pool is put to an annual general meeting. The government as a shareholder would be required to vote in relation to directors. I understand that the shareholding minister, Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, has indicated that the government will not be voting against that resolution, so that would give an indication as to what is required in relation to the market and what the proper remuneration is. Given consideration of other corporate salaries of comparable companies, the shareholder minister takes the view that it is reasonable in the circumstances and therefore would not be voting against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and for his interest in the ongoing reform of the workplace relations system in this country. The old system of awards that operates in this country still contains many ridiculous provisions and, indeed, inordinate amounts of red tape. Let me give the House a few examples of this. One award contains an allowance of $3 a day if office workers have to share facilities with building workers. So if an office worker has to share a lift with a building worker who has some mud on his boots or if he needs to share the same bathroom facility because a building is being renovated, there is an award provision which says that the office worker gets an extra $3 a day - absolutely ridiculous.There is another award provision that says that unionists should not be required to work with non-union members. In the private sector union membership has fallen to 17 per cent, and yet there is an award that says that union members should not be required to work with non-union members. Another award limits the number of apprentices that can be employed in the workplace. In Australia we want businesses to take on more apprentices yet we have an award provision that limits the number of apprentices that a business can employ. This is absolutely ridiculous.The Australian Labor Party's policy is a policy that wants more of this. Its policy says that we should have a system of comprehensive awards - something which the Leader of the Opposition has endorsed. So too does the union movement. At last year's election the CFMEU distributed a pamphlet which demanded, if the Labor Party was elected in last October's election, the re-insertion into awards of matters such as seniority, limitations on hours of work and preferences for unionists. Imagine what a disastrous impact this would have on building sites in Australia. Building unions would determine who was employed on the building sites and the hours of work and the conditions under which they are employed. That would mean that in the member for Hasluck's state of Western Australia Kevin Reynolds would effectively be the human resources manager for every building site in Perth. These are examples of how ridiculous and rigid the old award system is. This is what the Labor Party wants. This is why we have to change workplace relations in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his welcome back. It is good to be back. I missed him very badly! I do not have the price of Singapore oil on particular days with me, but I can tell him that the ACCC does not need any direction from the government to investigate improper practices in this market or indeed in any other market. If there is monopoly conduct or if there is predatory pricing, or if there is some other breach of the Trade Practices Act, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has full power to bring proceedings and investigate. Indeed, we would recommend that it do so. If Mr Samuel wants to know the government's view, the government's view is of course that the ACCC should investigate any evidence - any credible evidence at all - of profiteering or anti-competitive conduct in this market. The ACCC would hardly need a direction from this government to do that because this is the government which has increased its resources, this is the government which has given it a very clear direction in relation to competitive prices and this is the government which has indicated that it will be moving to increase fines against anti-competitive conduct because we believe in free and open and efficient and competitive markets.Can I also say, while I am on it, that the ACCC should have a very good idea indeed of this market because the ACCC has conducted numerous investigations into this market. When the government did its last fuel tax inquiry, the fuel tax inquiry noted that there had been 44 inquiries into the oil market since 1983. I can assure the House that the problem in this industry is not a lack of inquiries. There have been 44 in the last 20 years. - The member for Sydney asks what the problem is with petrol prices. Let me tell her what the problem is. The member for Sydney might have heard of the world oil price. The world oil price does have just a little bit to do with the price you pay for petrol, surprisingly enough. If you see the world oil price at all time records then it is a fair bet that the price will flow through to the petrol pump. That is the thing about markets - as upstream prices go up; downstream prices tend to follow. That is the way an economy works.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. While I am on my feet I probably should mention that the electorate of Dobell has had an 8.3 per cent rise in the GP bulk-billing rate over the last 12 months thanks to the policies of the Howard government. As well as universal insurance for medical expenses and a guarantee of free treatment in public hospitals for public patients, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the three pillars of Medicare. Thanks to the PBS, Australians have affordable access to life-saving and life-enhancing drugs. This year the PBS is expected to cost some $6.5 billion, and the cost has been growing at a compound rate of almost 10 per cent over the last decade, even though all new listings are subject to rigorous cost-effectiveness evaluation.Since October 2003 there have been some 300 new listings on the PBS, adding over $1 billion to the PBS forward estimates. For instance, from 1 October a drug called Eloxatin will be extended to patients who have just had colon cancer surgery. This will increase their chances of avoiding a recurrence of the tumours by some 25 per cent. This drug costs $12,000 a year. Every month patients will pay $28.60 or $4.60 and the government will pay more than $1,000 every month towards these patients' treatment costs. But provided they are cost-effective and provided they meet rigorous evidentiary tests, the government is happy to see new listings on the PBS, because we believe in Medicare and we believe in the PBS.I happened to go onto the web today and I looked up the Australian Labor Party's policy on the PBS. The Australian Labor Party's policy on the PBS amounts to just 10 words. It is a $6.5 billion area of government expenditure and Labor's policy is just 10 words. Labor will, they say, 'deliver affordable medicines and improve the quality use of medicines'. That is not a policy; that is a cliche. It is because there is nothing but cliches from those opposite that the Australian people have concluded that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a detailed question that deserves a considered response. I will take it on notice and ensure that all his points are fully answered. Towards the tail of his long question he asked about future proofing. I need only direct him to the government's legislation with respect to future proofing - first raised some years ago in the Estens inquiry - which has as its basic meaning that rural and regional areas will not miss out in the future on the introduction of new technology because it is uncommercial for telecommunication carriers to invest in it. It is exactly for that reason that the government has the communications fund - $1.1 billion over four years - to invest in upgrades of HiBIS, broadband, faster internet and so on. At the same time there is the $2 billion telecommunications fund which will provide an income stream for investment in new technologies in the future.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member is aware, the government is involved in an extensive campaign to upgrade security at airports around Australia - $162 million has been allocated, about half of which will be spent in regional areas. Of course the airports themselves and the airlines also have significant responsibilities in that regard and they are investing large amounts of money to improve their security networks.Today I am announcing another group of regional airports that will benefit from this program. The honourable member will be particularly pleased to know that three of them are in his own electorate. Three are in quite remote parts of Queensland at Bedourie, Birdsville and Blackall. Those are small communities where it would be very difficult for them to fund the airport upgrades that are necessary, and the government is helping them in that regard. There will also be assistance for the airports at Coober Pedy, Kowanyama, Toowoomba, and Warrnambool. I also particularly mention Ravensthorpe in Western Australia because I know that local members there have been interested in that airport, which has had upgraded services over recent times. This group of eight will now bring to 31 the airports around regional Australia that have received funding assistance from the federal government to upgrade their security.Of course that is not all that the federal government are doing. We are assisting in relation to the development of rapid deployment teams, doing experimental work with CCTV at airports, improving access control and implementing a whole range of other measures to help make our regional airports as safe as they can be. A lot of work needs to be done in relation to security and a multifaceted approach needs to be taken. The government are responding positively to the concerns of regional airports to deal with those issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Of course the parliament will have ample opportunity to debate these bills. We will provide the parliament the opportunity that the Labor Party did - actually, we will provide more opportunity than the Labor Party provided on Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Not one of those privatisation processes were referred to a Senate committee at all. It is important to note that the parliament should deal with these bills expeditiously, because of issues that are very well known.This has been debated for years. I have not got the record - there have probably been more inquiries into this issue than there have been into petrol pricing across the nation. Can I make the point again: the Labor Party come in here and argue that we should be taking a lot more time - and I have heard the arguments of Senator Conroy - but let me point out to the Labor Party that when they were in office they did not refer the Commonwealth Bank sale bill to a committee, they did not refer the Qantas sale legislation to a committee -  - I am answering the Leader of the Opposition's question by saying that we are going to provide more opportunity for debate on these matters than the Labor Party did on the privatisations that they oversaw when they were in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question and his continuing and deep interest in Australia's primary producers - particularly in Northern Tasmania. He is joined by the member for Braddon in that regard. These two new members of the government have very strongly - even fiercely - brought the interests of their vegetable growers and other constituents to my notice and that of the government at large. I am glad to be able to advise the House that, following improvements in rainfall, there is some degree of growing optimism in the rural sector in many areas that conditions of and returns to primary producers will improve. I hasten to add, though, that the recent rains over many parts of Australia do not mean the drought at large is over - not by a long shot.Just yesterday, for example, the New South Wales drought was reported to have eased, but 77 per cent of the landmass of that state is still drought declared. However, crop reports issued by ABARE just a few days ago reflect the growing potential for a break in the worst and arguably most prolonged drought in 100 years. But we are by no means out of danger. Total winter crop production in Australia is now forecast to reach 31.1 million tonnes, which is down only two per cent on the 2004-05 financial year. Importantly, it is a significant improvement since ABARE's June forecast. Across the nation, the Australian government has provided $750 million directly to farmers through exceptional circumstances payments, which amounts to some $4 million each week. Every eligible farmer receives 100 per cent of their entitlement.It is a reminder to us of the importance of the agricultural sector to the nation's local, regional and national economies that during the 2002-03 financial year the drought wiped one per cent off the nation's GDP. The agricultural sector is doing a great many brilliant and new things. It is a very innovative, productive and efficient part of the economy. Its social importance to rural communities can never be overstated. Let us also remember the great stories that come out of agriculture because of the efforts of farmers, food processors, distributors and transporters. It is one of the leading sectors in productivity year in, year out - that is required of them. As of today, 386,000 people are employed in agriculture and over 187,000 in food and beverage processing.While many industries have undergone significant reform, often forced upon them by international as well as domestic circumstances, primary industries have changed, altered and improved more than most. In these times of drought, commodity downturn, international change and international trade barriers, the government stands shoulder to shoulder with the nation's farmers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question. We are not selling out the bush. We are guaranteeing investment into the future in bush telecommunications. We are guaranteeing that there will be an ongoing ability to deal with the need for future technology in regional Australia with what we are proposing. I am not aware of the exact and specific circumstances that the member for Corio raises. I am quite happy for him to give me the information on specific exchanges. I will take that up.Can I say that this government sets the rules to ensure that customers are provided with a guaranteed minimal level of services under the USO and the CSG, and the member for Corio knows that. Telstra has reported capital expenditure on its networks of more than $3.6 billion in 2004-05 and is forecasting to spend $4 billion this financial year. Can I just make the point that out of this whole process - and I refute the allegation that the member for Corio makes that we are selling out the constituency in the bush as far as telecommunications are concerned - I have not heard one word from the Australian Labor Party about how they are going to ensure and guarantee services in the bush and in regional Australia in the future. At least we have outlined a plan that is well thought out and well structured that focuses on investment, focuses on competition and focuses on regulation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and for his interest in what has been a very successful employment program of this government. Can I say that, as I go around the country visiting members in their electorates and talking to different constituents, one of the main questions I get asked is: 'How come when Kim Beazley was the employment services minister unemployment was 10.7 per cent and under you it's five per cent? Why was it double under Labor?' - Why can't the Australian people take the Labor Party seriously? Who knows? One of the reasons we have an unemployment rate today that is half the rate at the time when Labor was in power is related to the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, NEIS, which is a wonderful program. We know that since the program started 90,000 people have become self-supporting and independent through that scheme. - We know that it has been an incredibly successful scheme -  - which has been supported and refined by this government. When I was in Hobart recently, at the awards night, I was there when a presentation was made to JJ's pools and spas, located in Bundaberg. I know that the member for Hinkler is a great supporter of the NEIS program in his part of the world. We know that the proprietors there have performed incredibly well since their business was set up in 2004. So why was unemployment double under the Labor Party? Because they have no idea about labour policy programs. It is why this government has been able to put in place an unemployment rate of five per cent and it is why the Labor Party remain a joke in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for his question. I again direct the Labor Party's attention to the published statistics with regard to fault repairs. The public statistics from ACMA show that more than 99 per cent of services were fault free in July 2005. - The regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, publicly releases information every three months. - If I can just draw the Labor Party's attention -  - to some of the things that we are doing in this package, it was the coalition government that introduced the USO, that legislated the USO and that legislated the consumer service guarantee. It was not the Labor Party. We set the standards. We propose to tighten those standards as part of the current package and, on top of that, under the network reliability framework we propose to instruct Telstra to deal with about 480 of those cable runs each year. It is quite clear that we have a proposal in place that deals with a lot of these issues, but I again draw the attention of the Labor Party to the published official material as far as the reported faults are concerned.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, in answering the member for Makin's question, can I let her know that she was a winner not only as regards her team over the weekend but also as regards her electorate, because there has been a 492.3 per cent increase - that is almost a 500 per cent increase - since March 1996 in the number of people in new apprenticeships, in training, in the Makin electorate. In simple figures: 390 people were in training in 1996; and 1,920 are in training in 2005. Just imagine how much better off things will be in Makin when the South Australian government finally signs up to the new national training agreement. Today, the state of Victoria joined Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in signing the agreement, and South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT will be signing up soon, leaving poor old New South Wales, yet again, the isolated case.I must also say to the member for Makin that I know that she is not satisfied with the 500 per cent increase. When I visited her electorate recently and the combined campuses of Golden Grove High, Gleeson College and Pedare Christian College at Golden Grove, we spoke to 1,500 students. They are themselves sorting out where they want to go and what they want to do. They understand that being involved in a vocational trade is a mark of great success. The Australian government is also doing its part with the new Australian technical college at Elizabeth West in Adelaide's north. This will service both the Makin and Wakefield electorates and the suburbs of northern metropolitan Adelaide. We congratulate the Catholic Archdiocese of Adelaide and Northern Adelaide Industry Group for their success in that.To further update the House, the most recent figures show that, as at 31 March this year, 390,200 people were in training as new apprentices. That is up from 138,800 in March 1995. In the last 12 months, some 161,400 trade and related workers were in training - 41 per cent of all new apprentices. These occupations only make up 13 per cent of the employed work force. The commencement in trades has seen an increase of 13 per cent. In the last 12 months, 265,800 new apprentices have commenced. In the last 12 months there has been a 49 per cent increase in school based new apprenticeships and 70 per cent of all commencements are at certificate level 3. Again, imagine if the state of New South Wales came on board and signed up to the national training agreement. They are doing absolutely nothing to assist school based apprenticeships in that state.The member asked about recognition. Last week, the best welder in the world was here in the gallery, and the Prime Minister got to shake his hand. Imagine how we get to the point where a bloke from Eugowra - those opposite are laughing - was judged the best welder in the world at the recent world skills competition held in Helsinki. He was a gold medal winner. He came to Parliament House, along with a number of other gold and bronze medal winners. This chap comes from country New South Wales. He beat apprentices from Korea and Japan. They traditionally take that prize. Australian apprentices are taking on the world by getting world's best training. The government is determined to assist that process and to advance the cause, because for Australia's economic viability in the short, medium and long term the work we do is very important indeed.</DOC>

 - The government are not breaking their word. Over the last nine years or so, we have invested over $1 billion in telecommunications infrastructure across Australia, and it has dramatically improved on what it was when we inherited it. When we inherited the whole regime from the Labor Party in 1996 - and there is no question about this - we all recall that one of the last acts of the Labor Party and the Keating regime was to turn off the analog mobile phone system and replace it with nothing. There were no plans to fill the gap that was going to be left by the switching off of the analog mobile phone system. We have spent $1 billion over those nine years and we are proposing to continue to invest in regional Australia.The Labor Party just need to read the published statistics as far as services are concerned. The latest fault repair time performance figures show that 91 per cent of telephone faults were repaired within the CSG time frame in the last quarter. This is three per cent higher than in 2004. To give you an idea of how Telstra's performance has improved since we have been in office, back in 1998 when we introduced the CSG, Telstra was repairing just 70 per cent of those faults; it is now 91 per cent - a 20 per cent improvement. We should also reflect that when Labor were in office they did nothing to lift standards. People could wait up to 27 months for a phone. They are a hell of a lot better now than they were under Labor, and they stand to get a hell of a lot better under this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I congratulate him for his very strong advocacy of small business. I can advise the House that the business confidence levels of small business in Australia are overwhelmingly positive. The recent MYOB survey stated that eight out of every 10 small businesses were overwhelmingly positive in their dealings. This followed very closely on the Sensis small business index survey, which showed an increased percentage of small businesses again demonstrating how overwhelmingly positive they felt. In fact, they nominated tax cuts, in particular, which have been stimulating demand.The other area that they nominated was the government's industrial relations reform. I guess this is not rocket science for small business, because small business understands - unlike the shadow minister for small business - that the flexibility that they need in the workplace will be delivered by this government and that the unfair dismissals legislation that they have been crying out for for years will be delivered by this government.Let me get on the record exactly what small business had to say in the Sensis business index survey. When they were asked why they were supporting the federal government, the No. 1 reason was their industrial relations policies, followed by the belief that they were trying to help small business. SMEs across all sectors and all political leanings are supporting changes to the current industrial relations environment. When you drill down into some of these surveys, there was one disturbing factor that small business identified - that is, their problem in dealing with state governments and state government taxes. They nominated in particular both the Victorian and New South Wales state governments. When you look at the rate of land tax, the levies on fire insurance and issues like that, is it any wonder that small business criticises state governments but regards very highly what this government is doing for small business?You add to that - what small business have already identified in these surveys - our 25 per cent entrepreneur's tax discount and the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. I must get it on the record that the shadow minister for small business and tourism held a press conference on 11 August and encouraged the Treasurer to withdraw all of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. So is it any wonder that small business in this country regard this government as the champion of small business?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do not have knowledge of the particular issue you are talking about, but obviously I will get back to you as soon as I have it. But, Mr Speaker, I can assure you that this government does not engage in illegal practices. I can assure you that Minister Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, does not encourage any such practices nor have anything to do with them. I will refer back to the House as soon as I have the information required.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I can report to the House that the International Monetary Fund has released its annual assessment of the Australian economy, known as the 'Article IV assessment'. This is what the IMF does for all 184 members. I am sure that both sides of the House will be glad to know that the IMF has reported that the sustained strength of Australia's economic performance can be attributed to an exemplary setting of economic policy and institutions. The IMF notes that since the early 1990s, when Australia bottomed in living standards as a consequence of the Labor recession, per capita incomes have increased to almost 10 per cent above the OECD average. So, even though the OECD standard of living was increasing, Australia's was increasing faster and, far from being in that bottom half of the world league ladder of economic performance, since the early 1990s Australia has climbed the ladder and all Australians have improved their per capita incomes compared to developed economies overseas. The IMF notes that employment and productivity gains have been strong. The IMF records that there has been a six per cent decrease in the unemployment rate since the early 1990s. Unemployment is now at a 30-year low and six per cent better than it was under the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who was presiding over an 11 per cent unemployment rate in the early 1990s. - Modesty forbids me from naming who the minister for employment was when unemployment hit 11 per cent. The IMF notes that there has been strong productivity growth. It indicates that there is 'increased flexibility at the micro-economic level', and notes 'prudent and flexible management of monetary and fiscal policy within transparent medium-term policy frameworks'.All in all, the IMF report today is a glowing assessment of the Australian economy. If one were to compare it with the IMF assessment of the UK, United States, European or Japanese economies, you would see that no longer does Australia trail in economic performance - now, Australia is among the lead nations of the OECD. We did not get there by accident or fluke. We got there by hard work. A proper monetary policy, a balanced budget, reducing net debt, reform of industrial relations, abolishing wholesale sales tax, cutting capital gains tax and reducing income taxes - these were the things that made the Australian economy stronger, and if we continue with economic reform it will continue stronger into the near future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. All I can say is that for the honourable member to be suggesting that this government would have anything at all to do with illegal representation from one department to another shows just how desperate the opposition has become. It shows how absolutely irrelevant the opposition know they have become to the greater Australian public. It shows how irrelevant they were in 2001, when they could not find it in themselves to have a decent immigration policy. It shows how they have never, ever been able to stand firmly on one side of the line when it comes to protecting Australia's security. I think the member for Watson needs to take a very hard look at himself as to whether he has any respect for his own side.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I recognise her ongoing interest in our international relationships, particularly with regard to the effort that many of her Western Australian counterparts have put into the relationship with China, particularly in the minerals and resources sector.China is the fastest growing major economy in the world today. The Chinese economy is growing, on average, at about nine per cent per year. It has achieved that on an average basis over the last 25 years, which is quite a phenomenal achievement. This growth has lifted more than 300 million people out of poverty. A prosperous, outward-looking and engaged China is a vital component of both international and regional economic prosperity when you look at what is taking place within the East Asian region now in growth, linkages among those economies and the impact on that by the growth of China.Australia have been well placed to benefit from China's rapid industrial expansion because of our strengths. I have flagged some of the all-important exports that go out of Western Australia that have helped to fuel, if you like, the industrialisation of China. Australia's exports to China grew by 30 per cent in 2004-05, to stand at about $13 billion. During the last decade, our exports to China have increased fourfold, such has been the growth of our relationship with China.I know that many members of the House are interested in the export of manufactured goods. It is interesting to note that, in the last little while, our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to China have grown four times faster than to the rest of the world. So we are expanding our manufactured exports to China faster than we are to most other markets in the world. Services exports have grown nearly three times as fast to China than to the rest of the world. It is interesting to look at some of the key statistics as far as China's growth is concerned. In 1996, China had seven million mobile phones in use; in 2003, they had 269 million mobile phones in use. In 2003, there were 36 million computers in China, and that rate is doubling every 28 months, such is the expansion and development of the Chinese economy.The relationship that Australia, over many decades, has established and nourished with China is delivering and will in the future deliver significant prosperity to our country. Australia's FTA negotiations with China allow us to make the most of this unique opportunity as far as our exporters and our broader relationship with China are concerned. Our overall economic relationship within the East Asian region is growing rapidly and being drawn along by the growth of China.</DOC>

 - As I said earlier today, consumers in Australia are obviously suffering under exorbitant petrol prices. That is not good for them, it is not good for Australian businesses, it is not good for the economy, it is not good for the consumer price index and it is not good for other retailers because, as people spend more on petrol, they tend to spend less in other areas of the economy.If the petrol price were just a matter for an ACCC investigation, nobody would be happier than this government to have the matter solved. But I point out to the honourable member for Hunter that the petrol price does seem to be high in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. So, if the cause of high petrol prices was domestic conditions, one would wonder why they are high in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. The reality is that the price of petrol is high because world oil prices are high and refining capacity, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, has been reduced. You do not have to take my word for it, because you could have read this in the Age on 20 July 2005, where an op-ed piece -  - The op-ed piece in the Age was entitled 'No quick fix to the problem of pricey petrol'. The article concluded with the following quote:... there are no magic solutions to high petrol prices. It might seem clever to pretend there are, but the Australian people are smarter than that.Who wrote that? It was Craig Emerson, the member for Rankin. How could he have had the member for Hunter in mind when he said:It might seem clever to pretend there are, but the Australian people are smarter than that.I will tell you one thing: the Australian people are a lot smarter than the member for Hunter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. As I previously outlined to the House, the International Monetary Fund has just done an annual report on the Australian economy, as it does in relation to all 184 members of the IMF, the premier world financial body. It has endorsed Australia's fiscal policy, its monetary policy, its structural reform programs and its competition policy, but it makes the point - and the government would also make this point - that you can never rest when it comes to economic reform. The moment you rest in relation to economic reform is the moment you begin to slip behind.The IMF talks about things we have to do in Australia. It welcomes our recent reforms of pharmaceutical benefits. It welcomes the establishment of the Future Fund. But, most importantly, it says that Australia can get a productivity benefit from reforming its industrial relations system. After looking at the government's proposal on industrial relations and work to welfare reform, the IMF concluded:The mission urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility and work arrangements.You do not have to take it from the government, you do not have to take it from the Prime Minister, you do not have to take it from the Treasurer and you do not have to take it from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations because the IMF has recommended to Australia that we engage in industrial relations reform - met with great hilarity by the Labor Party. -  - The member for Denison says, 'What would the IMF know?' Well, what would it know compared to the member for Denison? - I thank the member for Denison for sharing with us all he knows on the subject of industrial relations! Who says there is nothing to be gained from industrial relations reform? The member for Lilley says you cannot engage in any further industrial reform in this country. - The member for Lilley says you cannot get any productivity out of industrial relations. He knows more than the IMF. The Leader of the Opposition said this:The industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry _There is a lemon here, but it is not industrial relations reform; it is the views of the Leader of the Opposition. Why would it be that the Labor Party opposes industrial relations reform? It has nothing to do with the economic productivity of the country; it has everything to do with the people who direct the Australian Labor Party - the trade union secretaries who give it its orders.I think members on both sides of this House are looking forward to the publication of a book this weekend. Melbourne University Publishing is publishing The Latham Diaries. - Maybe you could read it to your children. - Apparently in this diary, according to Melbourne University Publishing, the former Leader of the Opposition had this -  - Other views, Mr Speaker? I thought the House would be interested to know the view of the man that the Labor Party tried to make Prime Minister less than one year ago. He has written his views in The Latham Diaries, where he said:I'm not opposed to unionism per se -  - Mr Speaker, the former Leader of the Opposition says:I'm not opposed to unionism per se, just the idea of six union secretaries sitting around a Chinese restaurant table planning the future for everyone else. - If it is a choice between the views of the member for Lilley or the Leader of the Opposition and the views of the OECD or the IMF, or the Liberal-National coalition government, we will stand up for economic reform any time because it leads to higher living standards for the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am not aware of the details of any such report. I understand that there are reports to be put out by Telstra next month. - I am not aware of this report. But can I make a point with regard to services and services to regional Australia, because that is what the question goes to. In the whole process of this debate about Telstra and the level of services to regional Australia, we have put in place legislation that underpins the universal service obligation. We have put in place legislation that underpins the customer service guarantee. We have announced what we are going to do as far as the network reliability framework is concerned and what we are going to require Telstra to do as part of that licensing requirement. We are going to make part of the licensing requirement their local presence plan in regional Australia.We have made abundantly clear in this whole debate what we intend to do as far as the delivery of services to regional Australia is concerned, and that is what this government have done since we came into office in 1996, which is something that the Labor Party - you should note this - never ever did when they were in government for 13 years. Apart from turning off the analog mobile phone system, they never mentioned any interest in investment in telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia. In the last nine years, we have invested over $1 billion in regional telecommunications across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question, and I know of his real and continuing interest in these matters. Of course the government's response to the terrorist threat has been substantial. It is a three-pronged approach involving better laws to deal with terrorists and prevent attacks, equipping our law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the tools they need to fight terrorism, and international cooperation, because we know that the war on terrorism is not a battle which can be fought on any one front.I note that the Leader of the Opposition has recently expressed some interest in these matters and at the weekend gave an insight into the type of innovative thinking that we have come to expect from him and his colleagues on these matters. According to the Leader of the Opposition, we do not need new laws to deter terrorists; we need more spies. I am pleased to inform the House that under this government ASIO currently has around 960 staff, compared with 580 four years ago. This figure is expected to increase to 1,100 by the end of this financial year. I might say that no request from ASIO in the budget process has been rejected by this government.This significant commitment accounts for only one part of the $5.6 billion investment in national security since September 11 four years ago. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, I am pleased to advise that there have been more than 100 practical security initiatives. They include establishing counter-terrorism first response capability at all international and major domestic airports, increasing the rate of container examination by Customs and establishing Customs officers to board more vessels at first port of arrival in Australia, expanding our National Counterterrorism Committee exercise program, establishing the AFP mobile strike teams and joint counter-terrorism teams, initiating a national identity security framework, increasing the funding for AUSTRAC to provide vital intelligence to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, establishing and maintaining the national security hotline, engaging with the private sector to improve protection of critical infrastructure and supplying chemical, biological and radiological counterterrorism equipment to the states and territories.These initiatives are a record of achievement and a measure of this government's commitment to protecting Australians from terrorism. They do not diminish the importance of equipping our agencies with the legislative tools they need to successfully thwart terrorist activities, and I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition supporting the serious, practical measures announced by the Prime Minister and me last week. In the meantime, the government will get on with the job of protecting our community from the terrorist threat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. Indeed there are examples of archaic and discriminatory provisions in awards in the state systems in Australia. Let me take a couple of examples. The bag, sack and textile award in Western Australia contains the provision that no more than one in three male workers in a workplace can be juniors, but no more than one in two female workers can be juniors. And take the laundry workers award, also in Western Australia: there may be two female juniors for each adult employee but only one male junior for each adult employee. These are just a couple of examples of the mind-numbing minutiae contained in state awards that seek to regulate every minute of every day of workers in Australia. The only party in Australia which is defending this mind-numbing archaic detail is the Australian Labor Party.The Australian Labor Party has as a policy to call for the implementation of a comprehensive system of awards in Australia. It is no wonder, as the Treasurer pointed out, that in its report the IMF has called upon and supported further reform of workplace relations in Australia. In its report, the IMF said, in part:Further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labor demand and facilitate productivity gains.It went on to point out that large employers face up to six industrial relations systems at federal and state levels - something which this side of politics is trying to overcome by the implementation of one national system for industrial relations. This is something which, again, is opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the union movement.Indeed, the IMF concluded:The mission urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements.So it is quite clear that when an objective assessment is made of workplace relations in Australia and the challenges facing the Australian economy over the next five, 10 or 15 years, by the IMF, there is this conclusion that we need to undertake further incremental, careful, balanced reforms of the workplace relations system - something which this government proposes to do. Why does the ALP stand opposed to these changes? Why has the ALP opposed every attempt to change and improve workplace relations under this government going back to the 1996 reforms? As the Treasurer pointed out in his quote from a former Leader of the Opposition, it is because you have union leaders sitting around a table in a Chinese restaurant each night deciding what the policy for the ALP and the rest of this country should be. - I hear the member for Hotham interjecting. We have in the Australian Labor Party, in the member for Hotham and next to him the member for - I cannot remember his seat -  - Batman, and the member for Throsby, three former presidents of the ACTU, three of the six, no doubt, that sat around the Chinese restaurant table -  - If the Leader of the Opposition believes growing up in a family where my parents got out of bed at three or four o'clock every morning and worked until eight or nine o'clock at night is privileged, then he does not know what he is talking about! The reality is that, rather than being made up of the privileged members and union bosses of Australia that occupy the benches on the other side, this side of politics represents the ordinary people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Solomon for his question and I also thank him for the concern he has to try to combat this dreadful scourge which afflicts many remote Indigenous communities. Petrol sniffing in remote communities has claimed some 100 lives since the early 1980s, but thanks to the policies of the Howard government unsniffable petrol is now available in some 43 remote communities around the country. In the budget, the government allocated an additional $9 million to extend unsniffable petrol to another 23 communities, and yesterday the government committed a further $6 million to extend unsniffable petrol to at least seven communities and six roadhouses in a 128,000 square kilometre swathe of the central desert, centred on Ayers Rock. This is an area twice the size of the state of Tasmania.Also yesterday, the Commonwealth, South Australian, Western Australian and Northern Territory governments agreed on a comprehensive anti-petrol-sniffing strategy, including consistent legislation clearly banning petrol sniffing, effective policing to ensure that the law is actually enforced and responsible communities that are capable of giving their young people a decent future. Again, I commend the example of Yuendumu, which has almost eliminated petrol sniffing through practising zero tolerance and quite literally marching petrol sniffers out to the Mount Theo outstation for rehabilitation and treatment. As Noel Pearson said on the Sunday program a couple of weeks ago, when it comes to substance abuse, we need to 'rebuild intolerance'. That is what he said. Yet again, Noel Pearson is providing great leadership, not just to the Indigenous people of Australia but to the wider Australian community.</DOC>

 - I know that the honourable member for Page, like many members on this side of the House, is very anxious to see considerable upgrading of Australia's road system and wants to see, in particular, the AusLink commitment for $12.7 billion put into action as quickly as possible. This is an important national program that will help deliver critically important land transport upgrades around the country, including significant expenditure on the Pacific Highway - which I know is of great interest to the member for Page and all other members on the New South Wales North Coast.Again, I have to tell the House that still only two states have signed up to the AusLink agreement. Victoria and South Australia are the only states that have unlocked the key to this significant additional funding -  - to enable important road and rail construction projects to commence. It is important to note the significance of New South Wales and other states blocking the financial opportunities that are available under AusLink. For instance, under AusLink, New South Wales will receive $2,488 million, including $1,946 million for construction. That is 77 per cent more in construction funding than the state has received over the previous five years. It is a 77 per cent increase, and New South Wales has not yet signed the agreement. What about Western Australia, which I referred to a couple of days ago? There is $620 million under AusLink for Western Australia, including $460 million for construction. That is an 89 per cent increase over what they have received in the past. This is an 89 per cent increase, and Western Australia are dillydallying! They cannot get around to signing the agreement. I would remind the states that, if they have not signed up by 1 October 2005, all of the unsigned agreements will include the new construction code guidelines. - Perhaps they are waiting for the new industrial relations reform to take effect so that they can get the maximum benefit in their state.I was asked whether there are any alternative policies or commentary on these issues. On ABC Sydney Drive just the other day, the New South Wales Minister for Roads said, 'If I get the money, I will spend it.' There is a clear message to the Minister for Roads in New South Wales: he can have the money; all he has to do is sign the AusLink agreement. But it seems as though Labor are not all that committed to road funding.I noticed that Labor's shadow spokesman for transport and regional services waded into the issue yesterday with a statement in which he repeated Labor's election commitment to strip money out of the Roads to Recovery program - a program absolutely essential for the construction of urban streets and rural roads around the country - and to spend that money on other projects such as public transport, bus and ferry stations, walkways, railway crossings and real-time passenger information. That is their priority - the money goes off roads and onto all these other kinds of infrastructure expenditure. I fail to see how you can deal with the increasing freight task in Australia by building more cycle lanes, walkways or ferry stations. That is not the answer. It is time that Labor got on board with this very significant AusLink project and used their initiative so that all Labor state governments would sign up, get on with the work and build the roads so that we can stop some of the fatalities that are tearing so many communities apart at the present time.</DOC>

 - Can I say that access to communications services is important for families. Of course it is important for families. That is one of the reasons why we want to promote competition in the sector to get lower prices. It is one of the reasons why we have the HiBIS to extend broadband access. It is one of the reasons why we have a $2 billion regional Communications Fund. We do believe it is important for families.I take up this point that something that is important to families can only be delivered by a nationalised company. I think that is the premise behind the question. If Telstra is in private ownership, somehow that affects in an adverse way the delivery of services to families. Can I make this point: there are many things that are delivered in this economy by the private sector that are important to families. Let me give you an example: food. In this country, food is entirely produced by private producers, distributed by private transporters and sold by private retailers, and it is very important to families. But that is not a reason to nationalise the food industry. - Let me take another example which will be dear to the heart of the member for Melbourne. - I was going to go back through the Labor Party's history of supporting the privatisation of banking. Is banking important to families? I would have thought so. Did the Labor Party believe that, therefore, we had to have a government owned Commonwealth Bank? I do not think so. In fact, one of the proudest boasts of the member for Brand was that he was around when the Commonwealth Bank was privatised. Can I just say -  - Let me conclude by saying that we believe that a competitive sector, delivering lower prices, with an infrastructure fund to roll out broadband, is in the interests of Australian families. Can I say that the regional telecommunications fund is going to be of great assistance to regional families to future proof new services. In fact, it ought to be renamed 'The Labor Party future-proofing fund', because what it will do is ensure that those people get great services long before the Labor Party ever gets back into office and proceeds, as we have always known that it would, with its own plans to privatise Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I certainly acknowledge his commitment to supporting the needs of older people living in the electorate of Hume. Due to the strong economic management of this government, we have been able to invest record levels of funding in aged care, including in rural and regional Australia. We are aware of the particular challenges that older people face in accessing aged care in rural and regional Australia, and members will be pleased to know that over one-third of all operational aged care places - residential and community care - are located in rural and regional areas.This year, in the 2005 annual aged care allocation round, we have allocated over 40 per cent of available places for rural and regional areas. There is in place a viability supplement, recognising the increasing costs that the delivery of care in rural and regional Australia might bring. As of 1 January this year we have increased that viability supplement by a further $14½ million over the next four years, on top of the $13 million a year that currently comprises that viability supplement.The government also provide capital grants for homes in rural and regional Australia for communities who have difficulty accessing capital. Again, this year some $40 million will be available for homes in rural and regional Australia for capital requirements. Recently, we completed a grants application process to enhance respite services and information services across Australia. As a result of this grants process, some $374 million will be available for enhanced and increased respite services and improved information services. Of the 414 projects that received grants, over 50 per cent were located in rural and regional Australia - some 244 projects, up on the 193 rural and regional projects before the commencement of the grants application process. On average, there has been an increase of 20 per cent per project across Australia. We now have in place 54 combined Carelink and Commonwealth respite service centres across Australia. These provide information on aged care services and respite services. Thirty-nine of those 54 co-located services are in rural and regional Australia and, as a result of our grants process, two new services will be available in remote communities in the Northern Territory.The government has also allocated a further $9.3 million in the last budget for further respite services, through the 93 multipurpose services that exist in Australia to service remote and rural communities. The government is committed to supporting older Australians living in rural and regional areas. Meanwhile, the Labor Party has no interest in the needs of people in rural and regional Australia, no interest in aged care and still no aged care policy.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Sydney, can I say that this government has a simple proposition upon which it is elaborating its Welfare to Work measures. That proposition is this: people who can work should work. That is, if people are capable of working part time, who are capable of working 15 hours or more a week, there is an expectation that they should work. In parallel with that -  -  - They ask a question, yet they do not seem to want to hear the answer. In parallel with that, those people who are not capable of working for 15 hours a week - that is, people who, because of a disability, are not capable of working 15 hours or more a week - will remain on the disability support pension. In the future, people in that situation will be on the disability support pension. - I understand - I am indeed informed - that only 10 per cent of people currently on the disability support pension actually engage in some form of paid work. If you make a comparison between what a person with no paid work receives under the disability support pension - namely, a total of $290.05 a week - and what that person will receive on the Newstart allowance when they are undertaking 15 hours of paid work, you find that the effective money in their pocket at the end of the week is $382.25. - The member for Lyons interjects and says that is pretty mean. That is $382.25 compared to the $290.05 that they get at present. Let me say this: the government does not resile from the proposition that if people in this country are capable of undertaking part-time work then there is an expectation that they should do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. As I have informed the House, the federal government, under its co-contribution, has now given $309 million to low- and middle-income earners in Australia who, in the first year of the super co-contribution, received a dollar for every dollar they put in. But what does that mean to those low- and middle-income earners over time, because what we are about here is changing people's attitudes to their own retirement? A worker who is 25 years of age and who in the first year took up the option of putting $1,000 away and receiving $1,000 through the Howard government's co-contribution - getting an immediate boost of $2,000 into their superannuation account - over a 40-year working life, with the seven per cent interest rate, will have $28,000, in round figures, by making the decision even just once. In the electorate of the member for Greenway, as she will be pleased to know, in the first year of operation, over 3,100 of those low- and middle-income earners in the Parramatta region and around that area actually took the chance of getting a dollar for a dollar from the Howard government.She also asks: are there any threats? The threat comes in the form of the Labor Party's policy at the last election. So that the member for Lilley cannot pretend that he has been somehow verballed, let me read and quote from page 4 of their policy:Labor will abolish the Howard government's super co-contribution scheme from 11 October 2004.Many people in this House will remember the former leader, Mark Latham, in a photo opportunity at the Golden Circle factory in Brisbane with the member for Lilley. Photo opportunities are cheap, but many of those workers would have no doubt taken up the super co-contribution. In fact, nearly one in every 10 voters in the Lilley electorate actually took up the Howard government's co-contribution; some 7,500 members of the member's electorate took up the Howard government's co-contribution. I wonder whether the member for Lilley mentioned that to the workers at the Golden Circle factory. The member for Lilley had a policy -  - Yes! - Treasurer, he had a policy! The policy was: do not let these workers at the Golden Circle factory get $1,000 as a dollar for a dollar. The Labor Party said, 'If you're on a $25,000 income, we're going to cut your contribution tax by two per cent over four years.' What does that mean for a Golden Circle worker? It means for a Golden Circle worker $45 over four years - that is it. Mind you, if you are the boss of Golden Circle and you are earning $100,000, you will get $180 from Labor. This co-contribution is about rewarding effort. It is about rewarding people for putting money into their retirement. It is about building better retirement incomes for Australians - and it is opposed by the Labor Party.The member for Paterson has 3,500 electors who took up the co-contribution. The member for Tangney has 4,400. But what is the member for Ballarat going to be saying at the next election? Is she going to be holding up the Labor Party document to the 4,400 workers out there who took up the co-contribution, saying, 'You can't have it'? Remember the member for Rankin? He has a lot to say these days. Well, 6,500 of his voters actually took up the Howard government's co-contribution. And now it is even better: put a dollar in, get $1.50 - make a difference to your own retirement and get the support incentives of the Howard government.</DOC>

 - Can I repeat for the benefit of the member for Jagajaga that under these new arrangements a person who is on Newstart and working the minimum of 15 hours a week would effectively have in their pocket at the end of the week some $382.25. That compares to a person on the disability support pension without work who has $290.05 a week. If the member for Jagajaga could simply subtract one from the other, she would find out that there is a difference - an advantage - of some $90 between those two figures.As for the suggestion that somehow this person is effectively earning only $2.27 an hour, the reality is that a person who works 15 hours and receives Newstart allowance in addition to what they are earning effectively puts in their pocket, at the end of the week, somewhere in the order of $24 or $25 an hour. The principle which underlies this is very simple. We in the government believe that if a person is capable of working 15 hours or more a week they should do so. I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians also believe that. We have a generous safety net in place for people who are incapable of working 15 hours a week. That safety net remains. People will still be on the disability support pension if they cannot work for 15 hours a week, but there is some expectation that somebody who is capable of working 15, 20 or 25 hours a week will contribute to their own wellbeing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his interest in this matter. Members would be aware of the announcement made by the Prime Minister in New York this morning with regard to our aid contributions into the future. The Australian government believes that it is the combination of aid, improved governance and trade liberalisation that provides the greatest opportunity for developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty. It is not one individual element or another. As the Prime Minister has announced overnight at the UN world leaders summit, Australia aims to double its foreign aid commitment to more than $4 billion a year by 2010. This is projected to take our commitment to 0.36 per cent of gross national income, the highest level since 1986. The government's decision is a reflection of the generosity of the Australian people, as evidenced in the response by the Australian people to the tsunami disaster in Indonesia recently.Importantly, the aid will be conditional on strengthened governance and reduced corruption. Australia is already taking a leading role to assist developing nations, particularly in our own neighbourhood, the Asia-Pacific region, as evidenced by our strong support for the RAMSI mission in the Solomon Islands and our enormous program of assistance in Papua New Guinea. However, as the Prime Minister has said, aid alone will not end poverty. It can make a significant contribution, but it will not end poverty.On the trade front we have liberalised our markets, giving 50 least developed countries tariff-free access to the Australian market as a contribution to poverty alleviation, and we continue to push, through the Cairns Group, for a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organisation Doha Round, where reform of agriculture, so crucial for developing nations, has become a major sticking point.To make the point again, Australia has announced that we propose to significantly increase our level of overseas aid. That will significantly help, particularly in our neighbourhood, the alleviation of poverty. But with that we need to see improved governance and as well as trade liberalisation - and, most importantly and particularly, trade liberalisation in the area of agricultural trade liberalisation - to help alleviate poverty and lift many of the least developed countries and developing countries out of that poverty trap that they find themselves in today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The simple answer to the question is no. In fact, across the OECD, participation in higher education is measured differently. In this country we have increased over the last decade the proportion of Australians with a university education from nine per cent to almost 20 per cent of the Australian population. I might also add that in the last nine years the revenues available to Australian universities have increased more than $4 billion - and $2½ billion of that has come from the Australian government. On the question of universities and university funding, however, I was a little bit surprised this morning when I woke up and I read this in the Australian newspaper under the headline 'Student 'stocks' to bolster unis':Banks and superannuation funds would be called on to help students through university by offering 'education stocks' under radical proposals to double the number of university places by 2020. - I am asked about the financing of Australian universities and the participation by Australians in education and university in particular, compared to other countries. The story in the Australian goes on to say that we should double the number of university places by 2020 and move to -  - On the question of financing education and university education, and the number of Australians who actually attend university: the Australian goes on to report that the member for Rankin apparently has a book that is forthcoming - one of a number of books. In it, he is proposing that he would finance participation in universities with a 'human capital contract'. He says:Under this proposal, you would basically enter into an arrangement with a private financier to cover tuition costs and living expenses.He goes on to say:This is an equity investment. What distinguishes equity from debt is you get a percentage of future earnings rather than a flat amount.So here we have the member for Rankin proposing, firstly, to double the number of Australians in universities by 2020 and, secondly, that Australian students would actually go along to a private bank or superannuation fund to get the financing for it and that the bank or fund would make an equity investment in the education of the person taking it. In other words, the Labor Party, which today has a policy that bans Australians from paying full fees in their own universities, would propose to ban the government sponsored loan scheme for those students, yet the Labor Party backbench is proposing to send loan schemes out to the private sector.I point out to the member for Rankin, firstly, that Labor Party policy is totally opposed to what he is proposing, but if he wants to have a chat to me about it I am happy to see him. The second thing he needs to appreciate is that, if we were to double the number of Australians going to university by 2020, we would need another 700,000 Australians in the system. By 2020, population growth will be less than half of one per cent. We are currently growing at 1.2. The Treasurer said in last year's budget, in relation to the baby bonus: 'Have one for yourself, one for your wife and one for your family.' You would have to add to that: 'Have nine for the universities.' The Labor Party is totally obsessed with higher education. It wants to double the number of people going to university. We will be trawling through nursing homes saying: 'You look all right. Why don't you go back and do an economics degree?' That is the kind of madness that is gripping the Labor Party: ideologues on the front bench who are opposed to the private sector and ideologues on the back bench wanting to send students off to banks.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can inform the House that in the current financial year of 2005-06 the Australian government has allocated $2.5 billion for international aid. That is a very substantial sum, and it compares to the allocation in the year 2000 of $1.6 billion. Since the year 2000-01, Australia has increased its international aid by over 30 per cent in real terms. That is aid which is going out to people in the Third World particularly who need improvement in services such as health and education. Overnight, the government announced that it is proposing to increase Australia's aid commitment by 2010 to around $4 billion - that is, from $2½ billion up to $4 billion in 2010 - where the aid to GDP ratio would be around 0.37 per cent on current expectations.Australia focuses its aid program particularly in the Pacific and in our near neighbourhood. For example, under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, Australia made the largest single aid commitment it has ever made in the history of this country when Australians opened their hearts and their wallets to help people affected in Aceh by the Boxing Day tsunami. That money is now being allocated to important projects not just in Aceh, where Australia is building hospitals and schools, but throughout the whole of Indonesia, as Australia uses that calamity to draw closer to our nearest neighbour and to reach out a helping hand from a strong economy to help the people of Indonesia.As we increase our aid, we will be focusing it on the Pacific in particular. Why? Because it is in the Pacific that Australia can make the biggest difference. The Pacific is Australia's area of obligation and Australia's area of influence. Many of the European countries which have been colonial powers in Africa naturally focus on Africa rather than on the Pacific, which is Australia's specific area of interest and influence. So we will ensure that as that aid grows it is focused on areas where it is needed, it is done in a transparent way, it is done in a way which is accountable to Australian taxpayers, it gets past corrupt governments and it gets to the people who really need it.The last thing I would like to say is that, with the increase in aid, we should never, ever forget this principle: as good as aid is, it can only go so far in helping developing economies and people in poverty. The biggest contribution that could be made to people in developing countries would be to reform the world trading order. Let me give you these figures. The World Bank has estimated that trade liberalisation would deliver an additional $350 billion to developing countries by 2015. This compares with an estimated total overseas development aid from all developed countries of around $79 billion in 2004. If you want some idea of proportion, overseas aid is delivering about one-quarter of what trade liberalisation could deliver to the developing world. Although Australia will increase its aid allocation, as announced by the Prime Minister, we should never take our eyes off trade liberalisation to allow economies to develop and to give better standards of living to those who are now living in poverty in the Third World.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question on Telstra and the process of privatisation that is currently being debated. At the same time, it is important to note the overall Connect Australia package that the government has put forward as part of the policy setting for the future of telecommunications in Australia. It is very important that we recognise what that will do. Telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia will be significantly enhanced by the injection of $3.1 billion. It is important also to note that that will require the commitment and the investment of Telstra into the future. The conditions that we are putting on the licensing arrangements for the work that they have to do to maintain those levels of services across Australia, and particularly in regional Australia, will obviously require a very large work force as far as Telstra is concerned.I make the point that, yesterday, the Australian Labor Party - both here and in the other place - asked questions about some report on the staffing of Telstra into the future. Those questions were based on some commentary in the media over a week ago. It forced Telstra to release a statement yesterday which said that there was no such report. Telstra sent a letter to the ASX which, in part, said:Telstra has not taken any decision to cut 10,000 jobs as stated by Senator Conroy or 14,000 jobs as reported in the media. Senator Conroy has referred to a 104 page document. Telstra is not aware of the specific document referred to. There are no documents of which Telstra is aware recommending job cuts of the magnitude referred to by Senator Conroy.I table the letter from Telstra. I repeat: the commitment the government is making to the future of telecommunications across Australia is to ensure there is adequate investment in future technology so that services are maintained, particularly in regional Australia, and, as a result, there will be greater competition in the telecommunications sector across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Ever since he joined this place, the member for Hinkler has taken a very keen interest in telecommunications as Chair of the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, which looks after the interests in this area. The member asked about the importance of telecommunications Australia-wide but particularly in rural and regional Australia. This government takes the issue of telecommunications and its importance to Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, very seriously. I point out again that the Connect Australia telecommunications package will give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services. The $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband and mobile phone services will start on 1 January 2006. When was the last time you ever heard of an Australian Labor Party policy proposal that spent that sort of money on telecommunications - over and above that which is being invested by the major provider and other providers? When was the last time you heard it? You have not.The package also delivers a $2 billion communications fund. Earnings from that fund will be available to provide new communications technology for rural Australia into the future. It will provide a more robust regulatory framework to give assurance to consumers across Australia about their services. Importantly, it enhances the competition framework and further strengthens safeguards to protect consumers. Yesterday afternoon in Canberra, this package received the support of the National Farmers Federation. This is quite significant because the NFF have been in active consultation with the government for many months on this package. They have been working constructively with the government to ensure that their members and those electors across regional Australia receive what they deserve. - That is not what Peter Corish said. He did not say that they were sold out; he said he supports the package. I quote from the NFF release, which said:NFF believes that the proposed legislative package, associated funding and assurances from Government in regard to programs and other matters, will secure quality affordable telecommunications services now and into the future for farmers and rural Australians, irrespective of the ownership of any provider.NFF supports the passage of the current package of Telecommunications Bills through Parliament.That is the peak farm body of Australia out publicly yesterday supporting this package because they agree with the government. They agree with the government that this will deliver a much improved telecommunications system to rural and regional Australia tomorrow and well into the future, with the guarantees attached to that. I table a copy of their press release.</DOC>

 - Can I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the correspondence released publicly by Telstra, not private emails. There should be a question asked about how the Leader of the Opposition got a copy of the email. -  - That is a matter on the public record in terms of what Telstra proposes to do. All I have to say in response to the Leader of the Opposition with regard to employment in Telstra is that, under the guidance of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the relevant minister during the eighties and nineties, there were 20,000 jobs cut from Telstra's predecessor, Telecom, in New South Wales alone.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. Yesterday the World Bank released a publication entitled Doing business in 2006: creating jobs. It ranked 155 economies around the world on the basis of 10 indicators. Of those 155 economies, it ranked Australia as the sixth-best business-friendly economy in the world. There were five in front of Australia: New Zealand, Singapore, the US, Canada and Norway. There were 149 behind Australia, including such economies as the UK, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany.Australia ranked very well on starting a business, which was the second easiest in Australia of anywhere in the world; on getting credit, where we ranked very well; and on business taxes. The survey found that a medium sized company in Australia had to spend 107 hours and pay 37 per cent of gross profit in taxes. The OECD average was 192 hours, paying 46.1 per cent of profit in taxes.Areas where Australia could improve its business environment are in securing rights to property, investor protection, and hiring and firing workers. That is what this government proposes to do to improve industrial relations and make Australia an even better place to do business.I am asked what the barriers to reform in Australia are. The largest barrier to reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. - The Australian Labor Party is opposing industrial relations reform and it is opposing welfare to work reform, like it opposed the introduction of broad based indirect tax, balancing the budget, reducing debt and the Australian monetary policy. - Members may wonder why the Australian Labor Party stands against reform. I understand that an important publication is coming out this weekend, written by the former leader of the Labor Party. According to last night's 7.30 Report, the author of that learned tome wrote a letter to a Labor backbencher recently which said:The numerous snakes, freaks ... and sewer rats in the caucus have had their say -  - He goes on to say:A lot of people will be unhappy about the truth but quite frankly I couldn't give a rat's ... about them.He says to this backbencher - listen to this:Good luck in the future with your work and thanks again for your support while I was leader of that thing. Kind regards, Mark Latham.'That thing' is the description of the modern Labor Party given by the former Labor leader - 'that thing'. It is 'that thing' that stands against reform in Australia. It is 'that thing' which has opposed every step that we have taken. It is 'that thing' which is stopping a competitive business environment. Let me say, Australia would be much better off without 'that thing'.</DOC>

I will seek information from the minister responsible.What have I told my National Party colleagues? I have told them how important it is that we see this money invested in regional Australia, how important it is that we see this level of investment in new technology in rural and regional Australia, to ensure that those services are there in the future and to ensure, as a part of this package, that there is an underpinning of those services in terms of accessibility, as well as the regulatory regime that is put into place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. Obviously we welcome the demonstration of Indonesia's commitment to fight terrorism, with the conviction yesterday of Iwan Darmawan, alias Rois, for his role in the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta on 9 September. The South Jakarta District Court has sentenced Rois to death for his involvement in the bombing. That is the most severe sentence possible. The Australian government, of course, does not support the death penalty. However, given that Rois is Indonesian, it is a matter for Indonesia and the Indonesian legal system as to what penalties are given to people who commit such heinous acts of this kind. He was a key player in the attack on our embassy. He recruited trained personnel, raised funds and materials for the bomb making and planned the logistics of this terrible crime.I am particularly delighted that Indonesia has demonstrated its commitment to fighting terrorism by pressing on to ensure this conviction. The conviction underlines its determination to prosecute to the full extent of the law those involved in terrorism and to ensure that they are caught. Its successful record in doing so and in collecting evidence and obtaining convictions shows that Indonesia is on target to deal with terrorism within its own borders.Rois is the fourth terrorist convicted for his role in the embassy bombing, and two other suspects are currently on trial. Forty people have been tried and convicted Indonesia-wide for their roles in relation to the Bali bombings. Over 300 Jemaah Islamiah members and other suspected terrorists have been arrested throughout the region. In this matter we work closely with Indonesia and other governments in the region through cooperation in areas such as law enforcement and maritime border and transport security. This counter-terrorism cooperation is unprecedented in its scope and intensity. But we are not complacent. We know that there are those who continue to plot, and we are committed for the long haul in protecting Australians and their interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, the GP bulk-billing rate in Kalgoorlie has gone up by five percentage points over the last 12 months. As its record shows, this government will do what is necessary to make our great Medicare system sustainable. There is no such thing as free medicine, and even in the very best of causes it is necessary to ensure that taxpayers are getting value for their dollars. That is why the government has increased the co-payment for the PBS. That is why this government never pretends that there can be 100 per cent bulk-billing. That is why the government has introduced a mandatory price cut for generics. That is why the government is insisting on a $460 million pharmacy saving over the next five years.The government is getting support from some unlikely quarters. The member for Rankin is not much good on education, but he knows what he is talking about - he has got something - when it comes to health. I quote:We can't afford to have so many older Australians having access to health care at zero cost or very very low cost. Budgetary circumstances dictate that we won't be able to provide free health care for all Australians.That is a bit of sense from the member for Rankin, which guarantees his permanent exile on the Labor back bench because Labor's policy is something called 'Medicare Gold' - a copper-bottomed con job with a $4 billion funding black hole.I went on to the Labor Party's policy web site this morning - and there were pretty thin pickings. I discovered that their policy on Telstra was 40 words and their policy on Tasmanian forests was 69 words; they had 152 words on national security but 172 words on Medicare Gold - and that is the one policy that should not even be there, because the Leader of the Opposition said in January:Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark.You know - the ghost that is coming back to haunt the Labor Party this weekend. The Leader of the Opposition thinks he can control petrol prices by having the 46th inquiry in 15 years, he thinks he can fix Telstra with a bit of good old-fashioned nationalisation, he thinks he can win the Ashes by changing the Prime Minister, and he cannot even take Medicare Gold off his own web site. I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: he will be judged, not on what he tells other people to do but on what he does himself. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to prove he is a tougher leader than the member for Lalor by getting her policy off his web site.</DOC>

 - I have seen the Westpac consumer confidence index for the month, and it is true that consumer confidence has declined to something like the long-term average. In the last couple of months there have been enormous volatilities, with a big decline after the interest rate rise back in March; a huge rise after the budget in May; and a recent decline, which could well be related to petrol As I said yesterday, petrol prices are punishingly high. These high petrol prices are punishing consumers. High petrol prices are not good for business, high petrol prices are not good for the government, and high petrol prices are not good for the economy. If anybody is welcoming high petrol prices, let me suggest to them that it is not in the interests of the Australian consumer or in the interests of Australian business. Unfortunately, as we know, the reason why petrol prices are increasing is the world oil price.As to improper conduct by any oil company or service station operator or retailer in Australia, the ACCC is instructed to take action against them. It has full powers to take action against them. It does not need any recommendation from the government, but I give it on a daily basis. As soon as there is any evidence whatsoever of any improper market conduct, the ACCC will investigate and, if there is a breach of the law, it will take a prosecution and, if there is a conviction, it has heavy penalties at its disposal. It needs no instruction from me to do so; but, as I say on a daily basis, the moment it finds any evidence, it should do so.Unfortunately, any action by the ACCC in Australia is not going to reduce the world oil price. Nor is it going to increase world refining capacity. We wish that it were the case that petrol prices could be reduced by a simple investigation or prosecution by the ACCC. As the member for Rankin said - and I know he is getting a lot of favourable mentions, and unfavourable ones:It may seem like clever politics to suggest to Australians that there is an easy fix to world oil prices, but Australians are too clever for that. They know that petrol prices are up around the world.They know that petrol prices are up around the world because of world oil prices, and they know that until such time as world oil prices come back down or refining capacity increases we will, unfortunately, have to live with high petrol prices. That is in nobody's interests, but it will certainly not be ameliorated by opportunistic and cheap politics - unfortunately the kind in which the member for Lilley excels.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell. It is great to have him here in the parliament doing a wonderful job for the people of Dobell. All Australian parents make extraordinary sacrifices for their children. This government believe that in education, in schooling, all parents should be free to choose the kind of school that they think best suits the aspirations that they have for their children and the needs of those children. We strongly believe that parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools throughout this country, whilst recognising they will receive less public funding for their children's education if they choose to send their children to a Catholic or independent school, should receive financial assistance in support of their children's education, and it will be largely according to the means of the families.Today is 14 September 2005. One year ago today the landscape for education in this country was changed when the then leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Mark Latham, supported by the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party, announced that funding would be cut to 178 non-government schools in Australia, adversely affecting the education of 160,000 children. For the first time in Australia, the Australian Labor Party was promoting a policy that would actually cut the funding for the education of Australian children. What we had was a policy presented that would punish parents for sacrifices that they make for their children.It is important that members understand that it was not a list confined to 178 schools. The way in which the list was intended to work would be that over a six-year period all non-government schools in Australia would hit what the Labor Party described as a resource index. Once the total level of funding for a child was reached, the funding to that school would increase at a rate half of what it does today.During the election campaign, at a meeting of Brisbane Catholic parents and friends on 16 September, the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party was asked if Catholic schools in Australia would reach this resource index. She said: 'We don't expect any Catholic systemic school to reach the standard until 2012.' In other words, Catholic systemic schools in Australia would reach Labor's hit list six years after the implementation of the policy. It is worth remembering that on 28 September last year a number of leaders of churches in Australia, led by Cardinal George Pell, said of Labor's policy in part:Labor's proposal to effectively cap government funding to schools within the non-government schools sector is regrettable.They went on to say:We express our concern at the lack of clarity in Labor's proposal and the potentially divisive mechanism of redistributing funds within the non-government schools sector.This policy today is Labor's policy. Australians need to understand that in two years time, if they elect a Beazley led government, they will be voting for a government that will be cutting the funding to Australian schools. The deputy leader of the Labor Party affirmed it was Labor's policy again after the election last year on 30 November. She said: 'Federal Labor will retain its schools policy.'One year after the introduction of Labor's policy, Labor's hit list would move from 178 schools, affecting 160,000 students, to 272. After one year a quarter of a million Australian children would have the funding for their education cut under a Labor government. This government have a help list. We have 8,500 schools on it that are getting up to $150,000 to support children's education. The Labor Party has a hit list. Under no circumstances will we reduce the funding for the education of Australian children.</DOC>

 - As I have said on numbers of occasions, it is the obligation of directors to act in the best interests of their company. What that means is 'in the best interests of their shareholders'. Directors are appointed by shareholders to so manage the company as to derive profit and to increase value.Having said that, the Corporations Law, and indeed the common law, puts other obligations on directors - a duty to disclose to the market anything that may have a material effect on a share price, a duty to act honestly in the discharge of their duties, a duty not to improperly use their position for personal advantage, a duty not to improperly use information for personal advantage. There is a common law duty and there is a statutory duty, but the principal duty of directors is to act in the interests of a company.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and his interest in the continuing reform of workplace relations in Australia. I note, in the context of his question, that today there is a delegation of unionists - led by the former secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Mr Leigh Hubbard - touring parliament and meeting with MPs. I was fortunate enough to obtain off the back of a truck the lobbying document for this delegation headed 'Discussion point for lobbying'. It contains such detail as where they will be based in Senator Gavin Marshall's office, how they find their way there and a lot of minutiae, including that, at the point of the lobbying exercise, they should hand up a copy of the joint union statement. I knew that the union movement are into pattern bargaining; I did not know they were now into pattern lobbying.This document contains a number of falsehoods. It says, for example, that 'economic prosperity has little if anything to do with industrial relations changes'. I do not know where these unionists got this advice from. It certainly was not from the IMF, who told us yesterday in their report -  
A government member - Or the OECD. - Or the OECD or any other independent bodies that have looked at that and said that, if Australia wants to continue its economic growth, then a key component of this is changes and reforms to the industrial relations system. They certainly did not even get it from the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, who, on 6 July, told the National Press Club, amongst other things:Since its inception in 1994, decentralised collective workplace bargaining ... has unleashed enormous productive potential.He went on to say that industrial relations reform is part of the success. So they did not get this information from Mr Combet. Other falsehoods in the document include saying that people will be undermined because awards will go. That is quite plainly false; the award system will remain in place. They say that penalty rates, public holidays and so on will go; yet they will stay. But there is one kernel of truth in this document. It says:Even Labor will be tempted to refer the powers in the future.What we have in this document - this 'Notes for lobbying of coalition MPs', this document from the union movement - is a statement that, in the future, even the Labor Party will be tempted to refer their powers to a national system. This points out what a number of union leaders have said - what the likes of Bill Shorten and Richard Marles have said: that it makes sense to have a national system of industrial relations in Australia. Even the member for Perth has acknowledged the economic benefit of having one national system of industrial relations in Australia.On top of that, just this week we had the state industrial relations minister in New South Wales, John Della Bosca, say that he would give consideration to giving up state jurisdiction over both occupational health and safety and workers compensation. It is good enough for Mr Della Bosca in New South Wales, the industrial relations minister, to say that we can have one national system for occupational health and safety and workers compensation, yet others say it is not a good idea to have a national system for industrial relations. The reality is that this document once again points out what everybody knows: a national system of industrial relations is a policy whose time has come in Australia. - The only people standing in front of that for political reasons are the Australian Labor Party. What I suggest these unionists today would be best spending their time doing is getting to the door of the Leader of the Opposition and lobbying him to get on board with what we know is a good idea.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those statements because ASIC has released a media release today which says them. I will come to the gravamen of the allegation that is put in a moment, but I can confirm that certainly my office has been in touch with Mr Lucy. I can also confirm that I have spoken to Mr Lucy today. You would have expected me to do so, so that I could actually answer questions in relation to the matter. The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. 
 - I have spoken to Mr Lucy today. The reason why I would speak to Mr Lucy today is so that I would be in a position to answer any questions which might be asked of me. So I am in a position to answer any questions which might be asked of me. - We did not actually discuss the investigation as it turns out. I regret to inform -  -  - She was licking her lips waiting for blood to come from the guillotine. Our Madame Defarge over there was knitting away and licking her lips, waiting for blood. - I should have referred to her as the member for Lalor. I come to the gravamen of the question. I presume that the implication of the question is that Mr Lucy has somehow been suborned into issuing a false press statement. You can impute improper motives to me - you do regularly - but can I say this: to impute an improper motive to Mr Lucy, to suggest that a person -  - No, not me. You do it to me every day. You are quite welcome to do it to me. But to impute an improper motive to Mr Lucy, to suggest that Mr Lucy, who is a statutory officer, who is a law enforcement officer -  - could somehow act in breach of his statutory duty, engage in illegal conduct or turn a blind eye to an investigation is an imputation against Mr Lucy which is not warranted and does not befit a leader of the opposition.Mr Lucy exercises his powers under statute. If Mr Lucy believes that somebody should be investigated, Mr Lucy investigates that person. If Mr Lucy believes that somebody has not done anything which warrants investigation, then Mr Lucy makes that clear. I table Mr Lucy's statement. I stand by Mr Lucy. He is an honourable man who is exercising his statutory duties in accordance with the statute and doing a very good job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin. She looks very smart in her scarf, as she did the other day. She is a great Crows supporter. Since the Lions are not there, I wish her all the best in her support. We brought to the House's attention yesterday the wonderful success of the government's co-contribution and the fact that those who sit opposite are opposed to it. The member for Makin will be pleased to know that there were 5,700 recipients of the Howard government's co-contribution in the first year - but, most particularly, she would be interested to know that 3,650 of those were women. This is a very important message. It is not only people in the work force but people who are not in the work force who should be contributing to their own superannuation, whether they are getting the co-contribution in the work force or whether they are contributing as they leave the work force, perhaps to have a family.The problem that we have with the Labor Party is that not only are they opposed to the co-contribution of the Howard government, and will deny all of these Australians $1.50 for every $1 that they put into their own superannuation accounts, but they actually have an active policy, a backward-looking policy, a policy that has no place in a modern Australia, not to allow people who are not in the work force, particularly women who have left the work force to have a family, to make a contribution whilst they are having a family.I turn to page 4 of the Labor Party policy. It has an author on the front page, I note - one that we will probably hear from again shortly. - That is correct, Treasurer. He is there; someone that they are all hoping they will forget. I am sure he will come back to us very clearly very soon. Maybe they are going to dump the policy as they dumped their leader, because it says in here:Labor will reverse the Howard government's budget measure which removed the work test for individuals under age 65 to contribute to superannuation.That means that, when many of the women in the member for Makin's electorate go to have a family, they can no longer contribute to their own superannuation. That is Labor policy in a modern Australia: you should be denied a right to make a provision for your own retirement.I ask the member for Sydney, who had nearly 1,000 women contribute to the co-contribution: do you, as the representative of women on behalf of the opposition in this place, believe that women should not be able to make a contribution to their superannuation accounts at a time when they are out of the work force? Or maybe the member for Jagajaga. The member for Jagajaga had over 3,000 women make a co-contribution. So she not only wants to deny them that; she wants to deny them the right to also have a chance to put money into their retirements when they are not in the work force. And the member for Lalor. And of course the member for Lilley.The member for Lilley had 5,063 women contribute to the co-contribution. That is a fantastic effort, I have to say - I congratulate the women up there for doing that. But I wonder whether he has mentioned to the member for Griffith, his neighbouring seat, that the women who work in the Mater Hospital, or perhaps to the member for Brisbane, his other neighbouring seat, that the women who work at the Brisbane Women's Hospital should be denied the right to be able to contribute to their own superannuation.I draw their attention to a press release by HESTA, the specialist super fund for health and community services. They have some 500,000 members and they report that there has almost been a doubling of their almost exclusively female work force and contributors who have made a contribution in the second year of the Howard government program - something the Labor Party says they cannot and should not do. This is a shame on the Labor Party. Their policies are, like they are, dinosaurs that belong in the past.</DOC>

 - I have no objection whatsoever to ASIC investigating every single person that they think is relevant - none whatsoever. I will make this point: the obligation on disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange falls on a company. It is a company that is in possession of information that would have a material effect on the share price that has an obligation to disclose.Let me say this entirely clearly too: if Telstra were in possession of information that would have had a material effect on the share price, it had an obligation to disclose it. If it did not, then there ought to be an investigation. But, as I understand the situation, Telstra says it was always observing its duties that it had disclosed to the Stock Exchange such information as would have a material effect on the price. Telstra says it was complying. If there is a suggestion that it was not, you have an investigation - that is what ASIC does. We welcome the investigation. ASIC will investigate and in due course will announce its results. I would encourage ASIC to make inquiries of anybody that it believes can assist in relation to that investigation. It ought to be open, it ought to be transparent, it ought to be thorough - there is no objection from this side of the parliament to that.As it turns out, ASIC does not believe that the Prime Minister has any obligation in relation to disclosure and has issued a statement to that effect. I would have thought that was obvious. The Prime Minister is not a director of Telstra, he is not an executive of Telstra and he does not discharge a function on behalf of Telstra; neither does he come under the Corporations Law, which requires the company itself to disclose. I would have thought that was pretty obvious; the statement makes it clear. But, if Mr Lucy wants to investigate anybody, he knows that he does not need an instruction, because he is a statutory officer. He knows that he has the power to do it. He knows that he has the protection to do it. He knows that he has the investigative powers to do it. He knows that he can take evidence. He knows that he has rights in relation to civil liberties. And he will do it. I know him to be an honourable man who will discharge his statutory duties, as this government would expect.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I thank him for being prepared to stand up for the thousands of small business people he has in his electorate. He, like every member on this side of the House, understands that 95 per cent of all businesses in this country are small businesses; that they are a vital source of economic growth, jobs and innovation; and that they have a very real concern about the current unfair dismissal laws. In fact, the Australian Business Ltd survey found that 65 per cent of those surveyed either had experienced or knew of people who had experienced speculative unfair dismissal claims and that a further 37 per cent reported that the practice of paying go-away money occurs regularly. This government, in its industrial relations reforms, will exempt from these current unfair dismissal laws businesses that employ up to 100 people; those businesses will be exempt. It is only this government that will deliver a flexible workplace for small business and for all businesses.We know that the opposition does not support such flexibility. But I can advise the House that there is at least one member of the opposition who believes that reforming unfair dismissal claims is good for small business. I can advise that that is the member for Hunter. I can further advise that the member for Hunter has been prepared to be on the record for a long time - in fact, since 1998 - on this. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that in an interview, the member for Hunter said:... my wife consistently tells me she could afford to put on one more person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals ...I say to the member for Hunter: tell your wife that this government is fixing the problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The member represents the largest electorate in Australia, which covers a great expanse of Western Australia. He has been a very keen supporter of this package to ensure that there is an opportunity to invest significantly in telecommunications infrastructure well into the future and to give certainty to all Australians and particularly to regional Australians.The Connect Australia telecommunications package will give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband and mobile phone services. It will also deliver a $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund, which will deliver on a yearly basis an earning stream to invest in future telecommunications needs across regional Australia. It delivers a more robust regulatory framework and it enhances competition. It also strengthens safeguards to protect consumers.The package has received support not only in the Senate and the House of Representatives but also across Australia from a number of interested groups throughout the community. I give some examples: the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, ATUG, told the Senate hearing last Friday that it supports this package. Yesterday the National Farmers Federation threw their weight behind the package. They said it should be supported; it should go through. They want to see this investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. Most importantly, today, in the Australian, Dick Estens has thrown his support behind the package. Dick Estens is the man who conducted the most comprehensive review of regional and rural telecommunications in Australia. He said he supports the Connect Australia package. - It is interesting that the Labor Party are interjecting and making a lot out of this, but Dick Estens did the most comprehensive review of telecommunications in Australia's history. I do not recall the Labor Party in government ever doing such a report. In today's paper, Mr Estens said:I'm happy about the end of the process. Let's move on to the next phase, which is now on building Telstra and building competition in regional Australia.Mr Estens and his committee gave the government the road map to move forward in respect of investment needs in regional telecommunications across Australia. This package that has now passed both houses delivers on Mr Estens' recommendations.</DOC>

 - The answer to the second part of the question is no. How do I feel? I feel very good because this is the biggest investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. On the day that the Labor Party's former leader has opened the book on the Australian Labor Party, on every single member that sits on the front bench and on the Leader of the Opposition, I say to the Labor Party and to all those who voted against this package that they have voted against the opportunity to invest $3.1 billion in regional telecommunications. They have voted against the opportunity to ensure a better regulatory framework. They have voted against the opportunity to improve competition in telecommunications in regional Australia. The government very proudly supports what we have put forward. As I said in my earlier answer, this package delivers on the Estens inquiry and it delivers the largest investment in regional telecommunications in this country's history.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Today is a historic day here in the parliament because the ownership and the status of Telstra have been finally resolved, and resolved in a way which will put this carrier on a modern, competitive footing to deliver good services to the people of Australia over decades to come.It was back in 1993 that the coalition, then in opposition, first proposed privatisation in relation to Telstra. Back in those days of course the Australian Labor Party was very gung-ho about privatisation, privatising Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. This idea that the Labor Party has always opposed privatisation - you would have to have a short memory to actually believe that for a moment. Our government have been up front and honest about our policies. We believe that telecommunications can be delivered by the private sector, as indeed it is in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand - in fact, in most of the modern developed economies of the world.We have resolved the status of Telstra ownership whilst putting in place a competitive framework so that there is competition to drive prices lower - a competitive framework which has been endorsed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We have also invested in a regional telecommunications fund. That will be a $2 billion fund, the earnings of which will be available to upgrade services in regional areas for decades to come - an investment that would not have been made if Telstra had remained with majority government control. - I spoke earlier of the Australian Labor Party's penchant for privatisation. There is one big difference between this government and Labor. When Labor privatised the banks and the airlines, it spent the total capital in full in the year of receipt and then still drove the budget into deficit. At the end of the year, there were no shares, there was a bigger budget deficit and there were greater borrowings. Labor totally dissipated the proceeds of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Our government believe that the proceeds should be invested for future generations. We will do that through the Future Fund to give young Australians opportunities in the future - a sound financial footing from a government that has set this country up to cope with the impacts of demographic change.This matter has been finally resolved. It has been resolved in a way which will bring competitive industry, better prices and better investment in regional Australia and set young Australians up for a much better future over decades to come.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I again recognise the invaluable contribution that the member for Hinkler has made with regard to telecommunications across Australia for the entirety of his time in this place. The member for Hinkler asked about consumer protection. The government have strengthened consumer protection in four key areas as part of the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package that was passed through the parliament this week. We are reaffirming the universal service obligation - let us never, ever forget that it was our government that introduced, through legislation, the universal service obligation. We are strengthening the customer service guarantee, something else that our government introduced. We are improving the network reliability framework and requiring Telstra to submit a local presence plan.The government has reaffirmed the universal service obligation in its commitment to providing basic phone services in rural and regional areas. The government has strengthened the CSG so that Telstra and all other phone companies must connect and repair phone services quickly or pay compensation. The government has increased the amount of compensation by 21 per cent with regard to this. On an issue that I know the member for Hinkler is very interested in, the government will ensure that phone companies cannot use the mass disruption clause to unreasonably claim exemptions from the customer service guarantee.The government has also tightened the network reliability framework, which requires Telstra to monitor the number of faults in its lines and upgrade them if they have repeated faults. As part of that, Telstra will now be required to upgrade at least 480 cable runs of its copper network a year, as determined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The government will review the network reliability framework in 2007 and tighten it even further if necessary.This package is about giving regional and rural Australia certainty and confidence - not just today but into the future - that, regardless of who owns Telstra, there will be a visible and effective presence in rural and regional Australia and their services will be provided.</DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, my office was in contact with ASIC, as I would expect it to be, so that I could be briefed to answer questions in the parliament. The suggestion that my office in some way directed ASIC is absolutely false, as I said yesterday. - It is absolutely false and unwelcome. Are there any other adjectives you would like? No?The Chairman of ASIC is a statutory officer who is protected by statute and who is given a statutory responsibility to administer the law. As I said yesterday, if ASIC wants to investigate the Prime Minister, I would welcome it to do so. He will not have been in contravention of the act for one second. Why? Because the duty of disclosure is not on the Prime Minister; as I told the House yesterday, the duty of disclosure is on Telstra. It does not matter; the Prime Minister never, ever had an obligation to make statements to the Australian Stock Exchange. - Telstra has an obligation to make a disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange, and Telstra maintains that it did make a disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange. As I said yesterday, ASIC will investigate whether or not it made proper disclosure. - ASIC are welcome to ask anybody they like any question they like in order to determine Telstra's obligation. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we would welcome them and we would invite them and we would encourage them to do so. They know they have the statutory powers to do so, and they will operate them in a way which is consistent with those powers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There will be significant challenges in the year ahead to manage the economy. For example, the rising petrol price will undoubtedly add to inflation. It will be felt in full in the September CPI. As the Reserve Bank has already said in its August statement on monetary policy, in the near term headline CPI inflation is likely to be above underlying inflation, reflecting the pass-through of the current strength in oil prices. But underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually. In other words, the petrol price will go into the CPI. It will move the CPI up, but what the bank will do and what the government will focus on is underlying inflation when you take that first-round effect out. We will, of course, look at second-round effects if it gets into the general economy.In addition to that, the task ahead in relation to economic policy will also be to manage current global imbalances, particularly imbalances between savings in investment between China and the United States. The task ahead will be to reform the industrial relations system. The task ahead will be to bed down a competitive regime in relation to Telstra.Are there any alternative views on managing the economy? The opposition did say that they planned this term to build their credibility in relation to the economy. Those of us who fought the last election will recall that during the last election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, fought the campaign on the basis that all he had to do to keep interest rates down was to sign a big pledge and that, once he had pledged to keep interest rates down, that was it. Members of the opposition might laugh at that proposition, but they put out leaflets all over Australia claiming that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham, would be able to keep interest rates down.I have an election leaflet which was an open letter to the people of Western Australia. On the front of it is a letter which was signed by Kim C Beazley. The opposition would have you believe today that Mr Latham is erratic or untruthful or cannot be believed. That was not the story 12 months ago during the federal election. - I want to say what this leaflet reads. It has a lovely photo of the current Leader of the Opposition and the former leader, Mr Mark Latham. Here is what it says:Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister.We have a letter which is signed by Kim C Beazley which says, 'Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister.' - Both of those comments were false. Labor is not ready to govern, and there would be no Australian today who believes that Mark Latham is, was or ever will be ready to be Prime Minister. Why would Kim C Beazley circulate that to the people of Western Australia? There are two alternatives. Maybe he has no judgment and really did believe that Labor was ready to govern under Prime Minister Latham, or maybe he did not believe it and he was less than honest with the people of Western Australia: 'Labor is ready to govern and Mark Latham is ready to be Prime Minister.' - This weekend some of us are looking forward to going to the football. Some of us are looking forward to having some time off. As for myself, I am going to tuck myself away with a good book for a quiet read. When I am reading that book I will be thinking to myself, 'These are diaries of the man Kim C Beazley thought -  - was ready to be Prime Minister.' Whatever he says today -  - he put this man forward as a credible leader of the country less than 12 months ago. - Those pen portraits are not the pen portraits of somebody who cannot be believed. They are the pen portraits of the person whom Labor trusted to lead it and asked the country to follow in the election of October 2004. I table that leaflet.</DOC>

 - Now that the legislation has passed through the parliament, the next step is the development of an operational separation plan. The ACCC is obviously going to be extensively involved with the government in developing the operational separation arrangements. It already has been and will continue to be in the future. Certainly the ACCC has made it clear in the past that it has concerns about the structural arrangements in the telecommunications industry. Indeed we know that from Mr Graeme Samuel's comments at the Senate inquiry held last Friday. But, at the same time, the ACCC has agreed that the government's model is workable. It indicated at those committee hearings that it believes there are a number of matters relating to operational separation that have to be carefully addressed during the process of developing the operational separation plan. So the interests of regional and rural subscribers as well as the interests of all Australians will be served by this discussion and negotiation between the ACCC and the government in drawing up the operational separation plan. There is no mystery to this. It is as would be entirely expected. The views of Mr Samuel and his colleagues, of course, will weigh heavily with the government.In regard to providing information in answer to the honourable member's last question some days ago, I understand that Senator Coonan is in the process of replying in detail.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her interest in ensuring that people in her electorate of Greenway can find jobs. Today's ABS figures show that long-term unemployment in Australia is at a 19-year low. This comes on top of the figures of last week which show that the unemployment rate in Australia, at five per cent, is at a 29-year low. That means that there are now 88,700 people in Australia who are long-term unemployed - that is, who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Compare this to the situation in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment and the long-term unemployed numbered 330,000 - that is, there is a difference of almost a quarter of a million long-term unemployed between the figures in 1993 and the figures released by the ABS today.The attitude taken by the governments of the day stand in marked contrast. On 6 May 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, then the minister for employment, was asked this during an interview on The 7.30 Report on ABC Television:PAUL LYNEHAM: So this group - that is, the unemployed - are being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap.KIM BEAZLEY: Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement._         _         _PAUL LYNEHAM: So a worst case scenario could see it - long-term unemployment - at half a million?KIM BEAZLEY: Well, close to that - a worse case scenario, yes ... Where it is now is unacceptable; where it's going to is even more unacceptable.There is a stark contrast between that attitude, which says, 'We're not worried about the long-term unemployed,' and the attitude taken by our government to reduce the numbers by almost quarter of a million. The $3.6 billion of welfare to work measures we are taking include $360 million over four years to help the long-term unemployed into work. We think 88,000 is too many - and 330,000, when the Labor Party was in government, was an absolute disgrace. Amongst this expenditure are measures for extra places in the personal support program, extra places for vocational rehabilitation, extra Wage Assist places and a $50 million employer demand strategy.What this is all about is the government getting on with the job. It is about providing more jobs, higher wages and greater opportunities for Australians, including those who are unemployed for the long term. The best form of welfare that we can provide our fellow Australians is to enable them to get a job, and that is what we are about.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I note that, thanks to the reforms that this government has put in place, the GP bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Lindsay has gone up to 89.5 per cent. As the Prime Minister and all the state Labor premiers recently concluded, Australia already has an excellent health system.The policies and reforms of this government are making a good system even better. We have boosted bulk-billing rates for children and country people to an all-time high; we have increased medical student numbers by 30 per cent; we have introduced a Medicare safety net that will help 1½ million people next year; and we are working with the states to ensure better coordination between different health programs and more seamless delivery of health services.I have been asked about alternative policies. There are no serious alternative policies, because members opposite are now indulging in an orgy of political cannibalism. Back in December the shadow minister for health said of Mark Latham: 'Can I say that my faith in him is undiminished.' In fact, the shadow minister for health and the former member for Werriwa seemed to have had the undying political devotion to each other of Lord and Lady Macbeth.Perhaps health reform was discussed at a dinner the shadow minister for health attended last night. It is a new Labor dining society. Labor MPs have put all their eggs in the one basket case. Of course they are not interested in health reform because, according to the former leader, the current Leader of the Opposition is more interested in preparing a dirt file than he is in developing good policy. This is what the former leader says of the current leader: 'People are still writing Beazley up as a decent loser, but he is one of the most indecent politicians I have come across.' When Labor MPs were last asked to choose between health reform and health inertia -  - At least there is a bit of friendship on this side of the House. -  - We are friends on this side of the House. We are not 'snakes' and 'sewer rats' - words out of your own mouths. The last time Labor members were asked to choose between health reform and health inertia - between Mark Latham and Kim Beazley - Kim Beazley lost. Labor members trusted Mark Latham more than they trusted Kim Beazley. I went onto Labor's web site yesterday looking for their health policy. Today I went back on their web site. What did I find? I found some political clothing. - Political merchandising. On 15 September - this very day - it is available on the Australian Labor Party web site. It says, 'Mark Latham for PM.' They will not hang his portrait in their party room but they are still flogging his T-shirt. It was $30; now $15. I bet they will be giving them away tomorrow. What this proves is that there are still people opposite who would always prefer mad Mark to cowardly Kim. 
Opposition members - Ooh! - If he is upset, I am happy to withdraw it. - Even if he is not upset I am happy to withdraw it.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is that certainly a large quantity of ammonium nitrate is shipped into Australia. We have significant demands for this product with our burgeoning mining industry, and of course ammonium nitrate is also important in agriculture. So significant quantities of ammonium nitrate come to Australia. About 99 per cent of our trade is involved with foreign ships, so it is quite likely that a significant proportion of it comes in on foreign ships. - But it is not true to say that these ships come in without any checking. The reality is that we have a substantial, comprehensive risk assessment process in place. - Each ship is subject to security checking irrespective of its flag. In addition to that, the members of the crew are checked against any alert lists to make sure that they do not pose a risk to Australia. If they choose to enter Australia, they must go through the same kinds of immigration checks as anyone else coming into this country.The Leader of the Opposition was in Gladstone a few weeks ago on that accident-prone trip and tried to make something of the fact that ammonium nitrate was being moved between Australian ports on ships that had a single-voyage permit. The reality is that the alternative to moving ammonium nitrate around Australia by ship is to move it by truck. Instead of this ammonium nitrate going from Sydney to Gladstone by ship, it could have gone by truck. It would have taken 500 semitrailers to make that journey. And which do you think is safer - 500 semitrailers going up the road or one ship?The reality is that we have a safety regime in place. It is much safer to transport ammonium nitrate by ship than by road. I think the Australian public would want us to continue that kind of transport regime.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the statement made by the member for Fowler in this House on Tuesday evening when she accused Israel of planning to 'rule Gaza like a walled ghetto, a giant penal colony, a concentration camp'. Through our linkages with the community or even family linkages, many of us know that millions of Jewish people died in concentration camps in World War II. It was an enormous crime against humanity. To make this sort of comparison belittles the suffering, pain and anguish of those who were left so tragically behind and the death of those who died a dastardly death in those concentration camps.As the foreign minister has told this House before, Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement initiative is a positive step by the Israeli government towards bringing about the goals of the road map for the Middle East, which the Australian government strongly supports. Likewise, the government welcomed Palestinian President Abbas's commitment to stopping terrorism and incitement to further bloodshed in the context of that disengagement. On these matters, the government believed that it had bipartisan support for these views. Obviously the comments of the member for Fowler are quite contemptuous of these matters. - As the member for Sturt has said, I think that the Leader of the Opposition should immediately discipline Mrs Irwin. He must insist that she apologise for her remarks. She must be required to withdraw them in the House. At the very least, because he may not be able to do that, he should disassociate himself from those statements, which should not go unchallenged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him that today I was delighted to announce the appointment of the Hon. John Lloyd as the first Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. Mr Lloyd brings a long background of involvement in industrial relations at the state level as well as the Commonwealth level, most recently as a senior deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to this role.What the establishment of the ABCC involves is the culmination of a four-year process commencing with the royal commission under Mr Justice Cole, which established a clear and undeniable case for a comprehensive clean-up of the building and construction industry. The Econtech report of a few years ago showed that the benefit of cleaning up the unlawful practices in the commercial building and construction industry could be worth up to $2.3 billion to the Australian economy, yet the ALP has opposed every single measure that the government has put forward in an endeavour to do this.We have had some more examples today in the media. Yesterday the Western Australian Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, Joe Macdonald, was convicted of assaulting two managers of a Perth building site after he attempted to gain unauthorised entry - another example of this sort of behaviour.Then we have seen another report where the full bench of the Federal Court ruled that the Victorian government, having resisted providing documents to the Building Industry Task Force for some 2½ years - at a cost of some tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to Victorian taxpayers - must hand over documents in relation to an investigation into allegations that it manipulated a government tender process to award contracts to a company that was favoured by the CFMEU. This is serious. This is an allegation of a deliberate manipulation of a government contract so that it did not go to a company that employed non-unionists in relation to this tender.The point of this is that, if a state government can succumb to union pressure, what hope have the little subcontractors out on the building sites around Australia? It is another example of why the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is long overdue. When it comes into operation from the beginning of October this year it might finally bring about a change in the culture and the behaviour in the commercial building sector in Australia.What this shows once again is that this side of the chamber, this side of politics in Australia, is about law abiding and productive building and construction sites in Australia and that the Labor Party, in fighting this tooth and nail, year after year, stands for the protection of the rackets and the rorts that go on in the building and construction sector. That is a reality. - The member for Hotham knows it because they were not prepared to do a thing about it. - Only this government has been prepared to do something about it. What they want to protect is the thuggery and the intimidation that goes on within this industry - the sort of thuggery and intimidation where, in order to get access to a building site, we have had instances of the building and construction section of the CFMEU saying that you have to pay $1,000 for a number of T-shirts in order to get access to a building and construction site. - T-shirts. Speaking of T shirts, before anybody rushes out to get the Mark Latham T-shirt and cap: it was taken off the web site at 2.43!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I did receive a letter from the member for Blair. However, I would like to refer to his request and his statement that the ex gratia payments for F111 desealers-resealers are inadequate. He may be aware that the announcement was for $40,000 ex gratia for those who had the most effect from the environmental hazard and $10,000 for those who had a lesser effect.By 15 September we had received 616 claims for the ex gratia payments. Evidently, those who are affected believe that the claims are worth making. I would also like to inform the member for Oxley that that is not the only amount that these people are entitled to if they have had illness or injury due to their Defence Force service. In fact, for somebody who has had a severe illness as a result of their defence service, such as Parkinson's disease - for instance, a 50-year-old person expected to live perhaps to 75 years -  - These people are desealers-resealers. Somebody like that would be entitled to a lump sum, including fortnightly payments, of $596,000. Were they to die, their widow would be entitled to an amount of $247,837. So the amounts are not insignificant. - Let me comment on what the Labor Party said about resealers-desealers. Your party was asked a question when it was in government and this was the response from the minister assisting. - The then assisting Minister for Defence was asked:... what danger does close contact with such solvent pose to human health ...in regard to F111 reseal-deseal aircraft? The then minister assisting, Minister Evans, said:It is considered that the safety measures described at 3b. above fulfil this purpose.In other words, that they had been fully taken account of. You did nothing as a party when in government about resealers-desealers. I also want to comment on other Labor individuals who have made reference to the ex gratia payment. I read from a letter dated 25 August. It says:The Queensland government supports the decision of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to make a lump sum ex gratia payment to all Defence personnel and contractors.Tom Barton, Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations.The reality is that you as a Labor Party did nothing in government. Now we have come out with an ex gratia payment and even the Queensland government supports it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and for proudly being a member of a government committed to high national standards in schooling. I awoke this morning to a headline in the Australian newspaper entitled 'Students unable to write a sentence'. The story is that there has been a survey of 660 Australian Defence Force Academy students and it reports that intelligent students are graduating from high school and entering university with writing skills so poor that they are not able to structure a sentence. In fact, the ADFA Associate Dean of Education, Stephen Yeomans, is reported as saying:What I particularly notice is improper sentence construction, inappropriate or no punctuation, lack of conjunctives, misuse of apostrophes, poor spelling and so on.The average Australian would probably think that Australia's minister for education would be shocked to read such a headline and to read such a study. The only thing that is shocking about it is that I am not shocked; in fact, I am not even surprised. In this particular study - we are talking about students who achieved a tertiary entrance rank of 80 or more - only one in six of those students could achieve 70 per cent accuracy in basic grammar. Just to put that into some context, there are students who have been accepted into Australian universities this year -  - to train as teachers, with tertiary entrance scores in the low 50s. In the Saturday Age, the front-page story was 'VCE English 'dumbed down': one book a year could be enough under 'English lite'' - students would have to read only one single book in year 12.I would also point out to the House - and I am happy to table these - that I have three examples of minimum passing results by students in the year 12 Higher School Certificate in New South Wales. One student, for a 40-minute essay question, was able to write only 63 words. That essay included spelling mistakes and 21 of the words repeated the question. That student passed year 12 advanced English in New South Wales and presumably now is undertaking a university program.The government is doing three things to address this. The first is that very shortly I will be receiving the report of the national inquiry into reading. I am informed by the chairman that 30 per cent of Australian children are leaving the education system essentially malfunctioning, as far as their basic literacy and ability to read is concerned. The second is that the member for Cowper, very ably supported by the member for Port Adelaide, is conducting an inquiry into the training of teachers in Australian universities - and there will be major reform. The third is that the government is driving an Australian certificate of education. We are determined through the Australian Council of Education to drive a nationally-consistent high-quality year 12 qualification.I also inform the House that I will be commissioning some independent work to assess the academic rigour of English, chemistry, physics and mathematics at the year 12 level throughout Australia and I will be making it available to communities so that they can compare the standards in one state with another. The battle for international competitiveness is going to be fought and won or lost in Australia's schools. It is not just about the fulfilment of human potential in our children; it is about Australia's place in the world and the standards that we expect.</DOC>

 - Both the Prime Minister and I are right. I say to the member for Sydney that, as I said the other day, the government believe there are considerable benefits in people being able to work where they are capable of working. We believe that far too many people have been locked out of the economic life of this country. For example, something like 700,000 children in Australia are growing up in jobless households. That is unacceptable, and that is why the government are putting in place some changes in the Welfare to Work measures.In the past the welfare system has been based on the proposition that either people could work full time or they could not work at all. Today there are many people in Australia who work part time and we believe that, if a person is capable of part-time employment, then there should be some obligation to do that. If they do that and work for 15 hours as required at the normal award classification wages for adults, that effectively means that a sole parent on the minimum wage for 15 hours a week will have $484.24 a week to take home. This compares to a sole parent pension recipient who does not work who receives $58 a week less. This is effectively about saying that we are going to give those people an opportunity to be in the economic life of this country and that we are going to do something about stopping the intergenerational poverty which is caused by allowing the current situation to go on. If the honourable member and her colleagues on the other side of the table were interested in helping out people in that situation, they would get behind these measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question and acknowledge his interest in aged care issues in his electorate. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in aged care homes. Today I announced new measures to strengthen existing protections around accommodation bonds. There will be a new prudential scheme which will strengthen financial management of accommodation bonds, and there will be a guarantee scheme that will ensure that bond balances are repaid in full.Under the prudential scheme approved providers will be required to comply with three prudential standards to enhance and improve the financial management of the bond holdings. Under the guarantee scheme, in the event that there is a default by a provider through bankruptcy or liquidation and there is default in repaying the bond, the government will step in and repay that bond to the resident or their families and then proceed to recover the debt and costs from the provider or, if necessary, to levy the aged care industry. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in residential care. We are providing an assurance to all residents and their families that their bond balances are secure.</DOC>

 - I guess each of us expresses this in a slightly different way, but I think the point the foreign minister was making was that banning an organisation does not automatically mean that acts carried out by that organisation in the past will not be carried out in the future, and I am sure that is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs was saying. I do not believe that statements such as that will in any way prevent a strong case being put by the minister when he goes there, and he will put that strong case. A lot of analysis coming out of Indonesia is suggesting that - precisely because JI is a rather amorphous organisation. The Leader of the Opposition would be aware what the expression 'Jemaah Islamiah' means. It is not, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, like the Liberal Party or the Labor Party; it does not have a precisely defined membership and it is a rather more shadowy organisation than the two organisations that the Leader of the Opposition and I have the great privilege - in a parliamentary context, anyway - of leading.Let me simply say that anything that can be done by this government to persuade the Indonesian government to ban JI will be done. I think it would be good if JI were banned, and I will continue to put that view to the President. The minister will be going to Indonesia tomorrow and he will put that view; but, at the end of the day, the collective action of all the resources of the Indonesian Republic are needed to fight terrorism. A legal ban is part of that, but it should not be assumed that, having achieved a legal ban, you automatically reduce the possibility of another attack. That is what the foreign minister was saying and I agree with him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that, since 1996, some 770,000 Australian workplace agreements have been signed. I can inform him that people who have Australian workplace agreements are on average 13 per cent better off than people on equivalent collective agreements. For the managerial sector, the figure is 19 per cent and for the non-managerial sector the figure is five per cent, making an average of 13 per cent. It is interesting to note what the Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday when being interviewed by Laurie Oakes - and this is relevant to the debate in the Australian community about whether people will be worse off under the workplace relations reforms of the government. He said:We don't favour individual contracts, and we believe that if you properly protect collective agreements and awards against an ability of the AWA system to undermine them, AWAs will disappear and that'll be a good thing.He went on to say in answer to the next question that, by the time of the next election, there would be almost one million Australians under AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition says he does not like AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to strangle AWAs, but what he is going to do is strangle the extra conditions and remuneration that Australians receive under AWAs. Far from the government being the opponent of higher living standards, it is the Leader of the Opposition who wants to cut the wages of a million Australians. He is the person who is attacking the living standards of average Australians.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the conclusions of the Comrie report and I am also aware of the comments made by the Ombudsman. Neither reflects well on the circumstances surrounding Ms Alvarez. I have already indicated, on behalf of the government, that she is owed an apology. She has received it and other matters are the subject of discussion between the government and her legal representatives. Let me say that, in the wake of the Palmer inquiry concerning Cornelia Rau, very, very significant changes have been made in the immigration department and there is an acknowledgement of the need for a changed attitude in relation to these things. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition - and I do so in the context of him once being a member of a government which championed the proposition - that over the years discretions previously in the hands of ministers of immigration have been taken away and given to departmental officials. In fact, it was an instrument of immigration policy under the previous government that that should occur.The point I am making is simply that the Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both ways: he cannot champion a proposition that says that discretion and authority should be taken from the minister and be given to the department and, when that discretion is exercised wrongly, inappropriately, carelessly or indifferently, then turn around and say that direct personal responsibility should be shared by the minister. It is one thing to sheet home personal responsibility when the exercise of a discretion was discharged by the minister; it is entirely another thing to do so when the legal authority to exercise a discretion is under the immigration regulations legislation vested in the hands of officers of the department of immigration.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. Can I say what a moving speech he made on the condolence motion earlier, and I thank him very much and very sincerely for it. The member asked me about the economic advantages of labour market reforms. Australia has now had more than 10 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Unlike other major developed economies around the world such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany or South-East Asia, which have all been through recessions - in some cases more than one recession - Australia's economy has been continually growing over the last 10 years. That is a result of serious economic reform like balancing the budget, serious economic reform like paying back Labor Party debt, serious economic reform like abolishing wholesale sales tax and replacing it with the GST, serious economic reform like cutting income tax rates and increasing thresholds, serious economic reform like cutting company tax and halving capital gains tax, and serious economic reform of Australia's waterfront. If we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of economic growth and higher productivity in this country, this country needs another round of industrial relations reform and, again, it will be the coalition government that leads it.The Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that there is nothing left in industrial relations. He says the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry. Well, there is a lemon in this debate and it is not industrial relations reform. It is the Leader of the Opposition, who parades himself as a front man for the ACTU, saying the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry. Contrary to his view, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said in February 2005:The biggest thing in this area - of productivity - is industrial relations reform. There must be a lot of things that can still be done.The OECD, in its economic survey of February 2005, said:To further encourage participation and favour employment, the industrial relations system ... needs to be reformed so as to increase the flexibility of the labour market.And the IMF, in its latest article IV report, says exactly the same thing:The mission urged the implementation of this package - the government's package - of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements.There we have the IMF, the OECD and the Reserve Bank governor all saying Australia needs industrial relations reform. - On the other side, we have the Leader of the Opposition, who says the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry. - Well, if it is a choice between the economic wisdom of the member for Brand and that of the Reserve Bank governor, the OECD or the IMF, I know which side of the argument has credibility. It is the side that this government is pursuing.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question: if he wants a guarantee, I invite him to look at the last 9½ years. This affords me an opportunity of reminding the House that since March of 1996 Australia's unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent to five per cent, which is a 30-year low; that over the same period the number of Australians classified as long-term unemployed has fallen from 198,000 to just 89,000 today; that 1.7 million new jobs -  - I continue the narrative under the general proposition that the best guarantee anybody in my position can give is to point to my record of fair treatment of the workers of Australia. I thank the ACTU. I do not often do this, but I do thank the ACTU for running an advertisement right in the middle of the AFL grand final with a grab from me saying that the Howard government has been the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had. That is absolutely right.As I have said to this House before, when I opened the campaign for the Liberal Party in the electorate of Lindsay in the last election, I said the proudest boast that I could make to the people of Western Sydney was to say that we had delivered to them a quadrella, the likes of which a Labor government could never have boasted: higher employment, lower interest rates, lower taxation and improved job opportunities for their children. Indeed, the list goes on: under our government 1.7 million new jobs have been created, inflation has averaged just 2½ per cent a year, home loan interest rates are at historically low levels, the real wages of Australians have risen by 14.9 per cent over the last 9½ years, average household incomes in Australia have grown by 20.7 per cent in real terms over the period 1994 to 2003 and the real income of low- and middle-income households has increased by a proportionately greater amount - that is, 22 per cent. No government has delivered better benefits to working Australians than has this government. We have done it over the last 9½ years and we will do it over the years ahead under this new workplace relations system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I inform him and the House that on Sunday the Prime Minister and I announced the further details to move towards a new national system of industrial relations for Australia - a system designed for this century to replace a system which was designed at the beginning of the last century to deal with the problems of the 1890s in Australia. These announcements give the lie to some of the claims that have been made in the misleading campaign by the union movement and by members opposite.In the face of those misleading claims I can confirm a number of facts. Fact No. 1: long service leave in awards will be protected. Fact No. 2: penalty rates, overtime and meal breaks will be protected. Fact No. 3: employees on state awards and agreements will get to keep their current terms and conditions under the new federal system. Fact No. 4: the government will provide greater support and advice to employees to enable them to protect their rights and entitlements. Fact No. 5: it will continue to be unlawful to force an employee from an existing award or agreement onto a new workplace agreement against their will. In the face of the claims of the union movement, these are the facts set out in the details released on Sunday.For the first time ever at the federal level, minimum terms and conditions of employees will be guaranteed in legislation through the new fair pay and conditions standard. If workers on awards currently have conditions which are more generous than the fair pay and conditions standard then they will keep those more generous conditions. Similarly, if their award conditions are less generous than the new standard then the more generous of the two will apply. Contrary to the claims made by the ACTU and the union movement, on the basis of these details, which will be provided in the legislation, employees can be confident about their existing conditions whilst being in a position to negotiate new agreements to their advantage.What this shows is that this side of the parliament has a plan for the future of Australia. All we hear from the other side is complaint. The rhetoric we hear today from the Leader of the Opposition and others is the same rhetoric that we heard in 1996, saying that the sky will fall in. Yet, as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have pointed out, since 1996 we have seen 1.7 million extra jobs created in Australia and more than a 14 per cent increase in real wages. Part of the reason for that is the reforms we made in 1996 to address the challenges that Australia was facing. We must continue to address the challenges that Australia now faces. That is why we are going to do this: it is for the good of Australians and their families.</DOC>

 - I will get to the record of the Leader of the Opposition in a minute, but let me remind the Leader of the Opposition of what has happened under this government. I know he finds it painful, but the grim reality for the Leader of the Opposition is this: we now live in a workers' market in Australia like never before. That workers' market has been created overwhelmingly by the energy of the men and women of Australia. It is the commitment of the men and women of Australia to an enterprise culture in this country. We do not only have a workers' market; we now have what I could call the enterprise worker in Australia. We have moved on from the old divides of white and blue collar. We have moved on from the old class division. We have moved to a situation where we now have in this country -  - We now have in this country the culture of the enterprise worker. That enterprise worker may be somebody who owns his or her business. There are now more people who own their own business than belong to trade unions. That is a measure - not a criticism of the unions - of the entrepreneurial culture we now have in this country. The enterprise worker might be the owner of a business or somebody who rightly sees his or her future tied up with the future prosperity of the enterprise that employs him or her. This enterprise culture, built by enterprise workers, is the culture of the future. The old blue- and white-collar class based divide is the culture of the past. There is only one side of politics that wants to go back to the culture of the past, and that is the side of politics led by the Leader of the Opposition.When he was interviewed by Laurie Oakes yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition actually took us back to an industrial relations policy on Labor's side that even pre-dated Hawke and Keating. His policy on industrial relations would not even allow the sort of phoney flexibility of which Laurie Brereton spoke after the 1993 election. But it is not surprising, because the Leader of the Opposition, who talks about a record -  
 - Yay! -  - The Leader of the Opposition invites us to look at records. I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government -  - I think the Leader of the Opposition needs a new tactics committee after that little performance. When the Leader of the Opposition sat on this side of the House, those of us who were around then remember that he literally boasted about how much he had suppressed the wages of working Australians. He boasted about it. He stood up here with the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, and they boasted about how they had suppressed the wage increases of average Australians. Real wages rose by a miserable two per cent in the 13 years they were in government; they have risen by 14.9 per cent in the 9½ years we have been in government. I think the Australian people know very well who the better friend of the Australian worker really is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. The Australia Bureau of Statistics today released housing finance figures for the month of August which showed that, overall, the value of commitments fell one per cent. This is the fifth fall in the value of housing finance commitments in the last six months. The overall fall has been led by a decline in investment housing commitments, which fell 4.3 per cent and are now 7.9 per cent lower over the year. But, in relation to owner-occupied commitments, they rose in August and are 14½ per cent higher over the year. What this shows is that first home buyers are now re-entering the market. The publication today shows that the number of loans to first home buyers was the highest since July 2002: 10,281. That is 43 per cent above the trough of 2003 and substantially higher than the long-run average of 8,800 loans to first home buyers per month. What this shows is that first home buyers are now coming back into the market, that the number of first home buyers that took out commitments in August was greater than the long-term average.This is a consequence of the fact that prices have stabilised. The house price series for the national average shows that, after almost doubling in the previous five years, house prices over the last 12 to 18 months have seen hardly any change whatsoever. I think members of the House would welcome the fact that first home buyers are returning to the market now that some of the heat has been taken out of the market. What that means for the economy is that the economy is not getting the push from housing and construction that it was in 2002-03. It is necessary for other areas of the economy to take up the slack. In particular, business investment is very strong. It is led particularly by the mining industry but it is strong generally, as we see business take up a lot of the borrowing and investment in this country to drive the capacity of the economy into the future with strong business investment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. He, like all members who represent regional Australia, realises how inappropriate some of the union driven industrial awards have been in the past. They have denied the flexibility that so many country businesses need to be able to perform effectively and to be able to offer the most flexible opportunities available to their own work force. WorkChoices will greatly benefit the seven million Australians who live outside the capital cities and provide new opportunities for business to offer the kind of flexibility in the workplace that can give them the opportunities to grow and expand. WorkChoices in particular will provide benefits for those regional businesses where there is a need to employ extra people, because in almost every instance they will no longer have the deterrent of the unfair dismissal laws. The unfair dismissal laws have provided a real burden to small business, which has been forced to defend what are sometimes unreasonable cases.The proposed reforms will certainly provide employees with the flexibility to bargain with their employer directly on any issue that affects their working life. These reforms have been welcomed by many of the organisations that represent people in rural areas, particularly the National Farmers Federation. They spoke out and said:NFF believes workplace relations reform is one part of the solution to the burning issues of labour shortages in Australian agriculture.In fact, their only criticism was their concern that there will be some farm businesses that will not be able to take advantage of these new industrial relations laws, and they are grateful for the five-year phase-in period that has been offered.This example clearly shows that you have got industry groups clamouring to be involved in this process because they know it will deliver real benefits to people right across the workplace. WorkChoices will move Australia towards a simpler and fairer national system of workplace relations where rights are enshrined in the law, where minimum conditions are legislated for the first time and where there is a real choice as to whether people join or do not join a union. There will be the kind of flexibility that is so essential to take account of the particular needs of regional businesses in country towns, where the atmosphere and the working arrangements need to be different from those that are imposed quite often by unions from their capital city offices. This offers real opportunities for regional Australia to grow, expand and take advantage of the opportunities that are provided.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that without seeing that particular agreement I am not going to accept the extrapolation on it from the member for Perth. But I will point out to the member for Perth the provisions of our policy, which make it perfectly clear that somebody entering an Australian workplace agreement must given the fair pay and conditions standard. In the absence of any express modification or elimination of matters such as penalty rates and loadings, the default provision of the policy applies, which means the award provision of pay. The attempt by the member for Perth to misrepresent otherwise is wrong and disgraceful.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and for her interest. The earthquake was mentioned in the House earlier this afternoon by the Prime Minister. It measured 7.6 on the Richter scale. It occurred at about 1.50 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on Saturday. The epicentre of it was 100 kilometres north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.This was the first of up to 19 aftershocks which measured up to 6.3 on the Richter scale and which occurred 40 minutes after the initial earthquake. So you can see how substantial the impact of this earthquake was. As the Prime Minister said already, between 18,000 and 30,000 people are believed to have been killed and more than four million people are estimated to be homeless. At this stage, national and international assessment reports are still being compiled, but as you can see from the television footage there has been substantial structural damage to buildings, including the collapse of many residential buildings, trapping the occupants. The Pakistani government has reported that whole villages have been destroyed.As the Prime Minister said, the government has already committed $5½ million in immediate support of the people affected by the earthquake, and that money will go towards organisations that can deliver medical care, shelter and food relief as well as water. During the course of tomorrow, our time, the United Nations is expected to announce what is called in United Nations parlance a 'flash appeal'. Based on the assessment of that flash appeal and how the money is specifically going to be spent - and by tomorrow we will obviously have the benefit of another 24 hours of assessment of the damage and the needs - we will have the option of making a substantial contribution to that flash appeal.The Australian government offers its condolences to the families of the victims. I am glad to say that there are no reports at this stage from my department, our High Commission in Islamabad or the other Australian missions in affected countries of Australians having been either killed or injured but we continue to monitor that situation.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to the member for Perth, I have no intention of commenting on a particular AWA which I have not seen and have not received advice on. I can inform the member for Capricornia that I am very happy to carefully take the member for Capricornia - as I am ready to take the member for Perth - through the provisions of the policy. The policy provides very clearly that if somebody enters into an AWA then the AWA must observe the new fair pay and conditions standard. - It also provides in relation to some specified matters - and the member for Capricornia drew attention to them - that unless there is a specific modification the existing provisions of the relevant award will apply. I do not know, without seeing this particular agreement, about its other provisions. I do not know any of the background. I know that the member for Capricornia would never, of her own volition, seek to mislead the House - although I might not be so charitable about some of the members of the tactics committee on the other side. I do not intend to comment on the individual agreement, but the provisions of the policy are very clear. They were outlined in the booklet and there can be no argument with them.</DOC>

 - Particularly since the first Bali bombing, as we now call it, on 12 October 2002, the government have been working very closely with the Indonesian government in the area of counter-terrorism. We have cooperated very closely at the police level. The Australian Federal Police work very closely with POLRI, the Indonesian police. We have good cooperation between our intelligence agencies. Obviously we do not say an enormous amount about that publicly, as members of the House who are particularly familiar with these issues would know only too well. There has been excellent political cooperation between Australia and Indonesia on counter-terrorism but, as we were reminded on 1 October this year, there is still some way to go before the problem of terrorism has been defeated. This is a problem that in the case of Indonesia, as I said earlier in the debate on the motion moved by the Prime Minister, goes back many years.Since 2004 we have committed more than $250 million in total in the region, including more than $50 million for Indonesia to boost counter-terrorist capabilities in areas like law enforcement and, importantly, border control, because there is some focus in public debate on the maritime borders between Indonesia and the Philippines and between the Philippines and Malaysia. Quite a considerable amount of effort has been put into that, and more will be put into it. We have also been assisting with transport security.I mentioned earlier that I will be visiting Bali and Jakarta this week, and obviously I will be taking that opportunity to urge the Indonesian government, as we have done on many occasions, to proscribe and constrain the activities of terrorist groups in Indonesia, including Jemaah Islamiah. But as I have made clear in the past, and I make clear again, honourable members should not think that proscribing one or more of these organisations, Jemaah Islamiah in particular, will solve the problem of terrorism. It will not. This is a campaign, if I can call it that, which is going to require an enormous dedication of resources - first and foremost by Indonesia and countries like Australia but also by the United States, which plays a very big role in the counter-terrorist effort in Indonesia. We can play a significant role as well.I want to conclude by saying that, while I am in Jakarta, it will be a good opportunity for us to have discussions about reinforcing the coordination of counter-terrorism activities in Indonesia. Again, that is a matter for them, not us. We should not be too robust, particularly publicly, in telling other countries what to do in situations like this. But some thought is being given to improving the coordination of counter-terrorist activities in Indonesia, and obviously we look forward to discussions about that.I will also once more emphasise Australia's very strong view that sentence remissions for convicted terrorists - not those who have been sentenced to death or who have been given life sentences, as there are no remissions for them - in particular for Abu Bakar Bashir but also for others, under Indonesian law as a result of presidential decree are something we would like to see changed. We would like to see the Indonesian government and the Indonesian President repeal that decree. They have been doing some work on that, but it is another point that I will emphasise while I am there.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. We have had an extraordinary effort undertaken by a number of agencies involved in Australia's emergency management response to the tragic events in Bali. That response was very clearly quick, decisive and effective, and it demonstrated a very high level of cooperation and coordination between all of the jurisdictions involved. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Emergency Management Australia, an agency that works within my department, for its role in activating the overseas mass casualty plan and for liaising closely with other agencies to coordinate the emergency flights for medical personnel to deliver urgently needed equipment to Indonesia and in the tragic identification and removal of blast shrapnel victims from Indonesia.The responses to the second Bali bombing and to those before that - the attacks on the Marriott Hotel and our Australian embassy, and in Bali in 2002 - have highlighted the need for very close working relationships between Australian and Indonesian authorities. That regional engagement has always been a very important plank of our work as regards Australia's counter-terrorism framework. Terrorist organisations are increasingly transient. Their membership and support networks are spread across the world, particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. Integration and cooperation of law enforcement agencies in which skills, experience and intelligence are shared is imperative to being able to mitigate the threat of terrorism in our region.The Australian government are applying practical measures to implement security and safety arrangements for Australians. We have committed more than $100 million over five years to enhance regional counter-terrorism capabilities and to fight terrorism at its source. This has included the provision of criminal intelligence, collation and analytical capabilities, and technical expertise. We have also had enhanced language and cultural awareness training, which is helping to strengthen the relationship. The already close relationship between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian national police has further bolstered the emergence of intelligence and operational linkages, which we have achieved in the new Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. These developments and the professional way in which our agencies have worked together are a very clear demonstration to the public that the government see national security as their first responsibility, and there have been very effective measures implemented to ensure that that is addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do not accept the premise implicit or explicit in his question, which is that the United States-Australia free trade agreement in any way weakens our quarantine or biosecurity regime. It does not do any such thing, and the government is always committed to - and will continue to be - protecting our borders in regard to quarantine and to maintaining the health and security of our food standards. Consequently, I think that the member's fears or concerns related to be US-Australia free trade agreement are misplaced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I appreciate that this is an issue of considerable concern in his electorate and elsewhere. I should point out to the House that a new influenza pandemic is not a certainty - it is not even a probability - but it is a distinct possibility and that is why the government has so far invested some $170 million in ensuring that Australia is as well prepared as possible. Australia has just about the world's largest per capita antiviral stockpile. The government is stockpiling some 50 million syringes and 40 million surgical masks. We have purchased an additional 303 ventilator machines for distribution to public hospitals. In consultation with the states and territories, we have produced a national management plan for pandemic influenza and this will be updated before the end of the year on the basis of expert and public input.The National Health and Medical Research Council has recently announced that $7.5 million will be made available for urgent research into the prevention, treatment and management of avian flu. Last week, assisted by a $5 million government grant, CSL began live trials of a candidate pandemic vaccine with mass production possible in the new year. People are entitled to be concerned about the consequences of any possible pandemic. I can assure them that all practical precautions will be considered and that so far all feasible precautions have been taken by the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I have heard and read the remarks made by Archbishop Jensen. Let me say that I agree with him that relationships are far more important than money. I think Archbishop Jensen is a very fine archbishop of the Anglican archdiocese of Sydney and he is a very significant and fine community leader. I take the view that Archbishop Jensen's concern for a right balance between family and work considerations is justified. In the view of the government and in the view of many people, greater flexibility will provide greater opportunities to balance work and family responsibilities. Whilst relationships and the close relationships within families are far more important than economic considerations, it is also the case that job security is very important to family security. Job security is built on a strong economy and a strong economy depends crucially on the right industrial relations policy, and that is what this government is about.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. As a doctor he knows only too well the issues that are at stake here. Australia has been leading the region to strengthen the defence of the Asia-Pacific region against avian influenza. We have been working within APEC since 2001 to help the region prepare for pandemic threats, including avian flu. On 31 October Australia will host a meeting in Brisbane of the representatives of the 21 APEC economies who are responsible for pandemic and disaster management. It will also bring together experts from a range of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and so on.Since 2003 the government have committed $180 million to combat the threat of avian flu, which includes $20 million under our aid program, to improve detection, surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Last week a high-level team of Australian senior officials visited Indonesia as part of our discussions with the Indonesians on avian flu. While I am in Indonesia over the next two days I will be discussing the outcomes of that visit with Indonesian officials, including with the President of Indonesia. I hope at the end of my visit I will have something to say about that, amongst other issues, depending on the discussions I have with the Indonesians. Let me also say that the government are working at a wider international level. We are a key member of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, which brings together concerned states to develop global capabilities to respond to these threats.We need to bear in mind that avian flu becoming a pandemic is of course not a certainty. Australia's Chief Medical Officer has said that the probability of avian flu turning into a pandemic in the next few years is 10 per cent. It is one in 10. So there is no need to run around and suggest that the sky is falling in. The fact is that the government are getting on with sensible and practical measures not only for us to address the issue here in Australia but to make sure we contribute to the defences of the Asia-Pacific region.</DOC>

 - I will check precisely what I said on that occasion. As we were shown yesterday, you do not want to believe everything the opposition tells you in question time. Let me say this: I treat the member's question very seriously, as I should. He is a serious member and he is a conscientious member. I am working on him. I think I might win him over eventually to our industrial relations policies. Can I just very seriously say that the point I was making in that program was simply this: on any issue that is the subject of political debate in our community there will be conscientious Catholics who will take one view and conscientious Catholics who will take the opposite view.In fact, you presumed in your question to refer to Cardinal Pell. I seem to recall Cardinal Pell some years ago making the point that there was no such thing as a Catholic position on a particular aspect of taxation. He was right. He made that point, I think, in the context of the 1998 election. I do not draw on my own authority to talk on matters relating to the Catholic Church. In fact, I invoke the authority of the leader of the Catholic archdiocese of Sydney - a person for whom I have an immense personal regard and who I think, like Dr Peter Jensen, is a great leader.My view is this. I do not think the quality of this debate is improved by somebody trying to claim that the totality of a Catholic view is either for or against the government's policy. I do not argue that. I do not invoke the authority of any of the Christian churches in this country for our policies. I will argue a policy on its own merits and I stand by what I said: there will be Catholics who will agree with us and Catholics who disagree with us; there will be Anglicans who will agree and disagree. That is how it should be in a nation such as this, which has a proper regard for the respective roles of the government and the church.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I can inform him that the case for reforming Australia's industrial relations law is that we can make the Australian economy more productive. If we make the Australian economy more productive and businesses more profitable, they will be able to employ more people at higher wages. We can make the Australian economy more productive by getting rid of six separate state systems and having one, by easing agreement making, by having flexibility and by giving people work choices. That is the case for industrial relations reform in this country.The opposition leader has put forward his views in relation to this. He was asked a question yesterday about skills and he cited in his defence the OECD, the Reserve Bank and the IMF. Let me say, as I did yesterday, that the OECD, the Reserve Bank and the IMF have all been clear on one thing: Australia needs further industrial relations reform. In the course of that interview yesterday he was also asked about essential services. Here is the reply that the Leader of the Opposition gave to that question yesterday:Now, on the essential services thing ... I would roll that back.The policy that dare not speak its name! He obviously realised at that point that 'roll-back' was not a word to be used in polite political discussion anymore in this country, because he said:I would change that. I would eliminate that and the reasons are simply this - and I will not use that phrase, I must say, in connection with these, so I've amended it immediately, I've amended it immediately because this is not the exercise that we're engaged in.The immediate amendment was just a whisper too late because the policy that dare not speak its name popped out. There was an American baseball player whom our American friends will know called Yogi Berra, who had a famous saying. He said, 'It feels like deja vu all over again.' Well, it feels like deja vu all over again when the policy that dare not speak its name popped out on industrial relations. The Leader of the Opposition was wrong about roll-back the first time and he was wrong about roll-back the second time.</DOC>

 - But you were in favour for a while; we read it in the book. I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me say, in case members of the House are not aware - but I know the honourable member for Canning would be - that on Saturday, 15 October, the Iraqi people will vote in a referendum on a draft constitution. I do not know how they will vote, and there is speculation about that. I will not add to it, but the fact that the ordinary people of Iraq are able to vote on a particular draft of their constitution is a great thing. This will be another example of how democracy is arriving in Iraq. We saw that at the end of January, when the Iraqi people voted for the Transitional National Assembly.On this side of the House we are proud of our soldiers who helped to end Saddam's regime. We are proud of those who are now training Iraqis to defend themselves. We are proud of those who are providing a secure environment for valuable Japanese reconstruction work and we are proud of those Australians who are working to assist with the elections. I think our policy is perfectly clear. We are fully committed to supporting Iraq's transition to democracy, because we support democracy. We are part of a proud coalition. I saw the British Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Reid, the other day and he reminded me that the British are determined to make sure they stay and defeat the terrorists. When I saw Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice in Washington and in New York the week before last, they both made the same point: they are determined to make sure that the terrorists are defeated and that democracy thrives in Iraq. Are there any alternatives? -  - You can tell from the interjections that there are some. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith, in particular, profess that their position now is to support troops out of Iraq: we should now get out; we should have an exit strategy and get out as quickly as possible. The only problem with that is that Bernard Lagan in his very revealing book argued that the member for Griffith in particular had disagreed with the former Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. He disagreed with the Latham policy of bringing troops out by Christmas. Despite the fact that the member for Griffith and the Leader of the Opposition argued in favour of the Latham policy, we know from the Lagan book that they did not agree with it.Nobody this week has mentioned, and let me be the first, Mark Latham's very interesting diaries. The point about those diaries is this statement:Rudd wanted our policy of the troops to be a review when we get into government so I overruled him and said yesterday that we wanted them home by Christmas.The fact is that, secretly, people like the member for Griffith and, presumably, the Leader of the Opposition actually support the simple proposition that we must defeat the terrorists in Iraq and that we must support democracy in Iraq. But because of the way the Labor Party works, they profess to hold a different view. I thought in Mark Latham's book it was all summed up with one simple phrase, and it is the phrase he used about the Leader of the Opposition. 
Opposition members - Boring! - I don't think you will find it so boring. He said this about the Leader of the Opposition: 'Kim Beazley? You can sum him up in four words: he is an opportunist.' If ever there was a great opportunist -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and I can inform him that when the government introduced the A New Tax System in 2000 the GST revenue was allocated to the states in accordance with a formula that they agreed themselves to equalise allocations between the six states and the two territories. I am happy to inform the House that, after four completed financial years since the introduction of the GST, every state and territory has benefited in the sense that they are now in a windfall situation - they have more money after the abolition of the taxes which were part of the arrangement than they would have had if the old system had continued. In 2004-05 the states will receive around $35 billion in GST revenue. The total windfall to the states in 2004-05 will be around $2 billion.No state has benefited more from GST arrangements than Queensland. Queensland has had the largest windfall - that is, GST receipts over and above what it would have received under the old system - of any state in the Commonwealth. That is why I was shocked to read a claim by the Queensland Premier yesterday that Queensland somehow was receiving less GST than it was entitled to and, as a consequence, raising the prospect that the Queensland Labor government may increase taxes as part of a minibudget. Here we are in Queensland, the biggest beneficiary of any state under the GST arrangements, own source revenue booming because of the property market and because of royalties out of coal - which is at the highest terms of trade ever - and we have the Queensland Premier saying, 'I am now short of money and I may have to increase taxes.'The suggestion is that in some way Queensland has not got what it was entitled to. Let me tell you what Queensland got in 2004-05. Queensland received, under the GST, $7.328 billion. If the old system had been in place, it would have received $6.559 billion. Queensland has received a windfall, in one year alone, of $768 million over and above its guaranteed amounts. If there is a problem in Queensland, it has nothing to do with GST arrangements, it has nothing to do with own source revenues, which have been increasing at a dramatic rate; it is all about management. If the Queensland government cannot manage its own affairs, it cannot expect taxpayers in other states to bail it out from those affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. What we have seen over the last 24 hours or so is the Leader of the Opposition attempting to scare Australian employees into thinking that they will have to negotiate their terms and conditions directly with their employer without any protections or assistance. Yesterday on the Steve Price radio program the Leader of the Opposition claimed:... an 18-year-old kid walking into a workplace simply does not bargain equally with his boss.If the Leader of the Opposition were genuinely interested in the welfare of young people, rather than patronising them in the way in which he has been doing over the last 24 hours he would have pointed out a number of additional facts which he failed to point out. Firstly, he would have pointed out that every employee who is offered an Australian workplace agreement can appoint a bargaining agent to act on their behalf. He did not point that out.Secondly, if he were genuinely interested in the welfare of young people in this country he would have pointed out that that bargaining agent could be a representative of the union, a lawyer, an accountant, a parent, a guardian or any other person. - If he were interested he would have pointed that out. Thirdly, and this is important, if he were genuinely interested and did not have this patronising attitude to young Australians, he would have pointed out that once a bargaining agent is appointed -  - then the employer must deal with that bargaining agent. There is absolutely no discretion. The employer must deal with that bargaining agent. He would have also pointed out that any person under the age of 18 years cannot enter into an Australian workplace agreement unless they have the consent of their parent or guardian to that agreement.Lastly, he would have pointed out, but he is not interested in the facts, that the AWA must contain the new protections which will be contained in the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. None of these things were pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is, as we saw yesterday coming from the member for Perth and the member for Capricornia, an intention simply to mislead this House and mislead the Australian people about Australian workplace agreements, something which the member for Perth at least conceded on the radio this morning. - The member conceded this morning that he misled the Australian people, and that is what he did. He misled the Australian people, and you well know it. That is the reality. Let us get back to the reality here and that is that some 770,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into by Australians in Australia - thousands of them in the electorate of the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, and thousands of them in the electorate of the member for Perth - and what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to strangle Australian workplace agreements and therefore cut the wages of those Australians who are earning more on those agreements. We stand for choice and flexibility, not for the regressive policies that are being adopted by the opposition.</DOC>

 - The government has released its tax cut proposals. It brought them down in the budget in May. What is more: I would have thought the member for Lilley would remember because he voted them down on two occasions in the House of Representatives on the ground that there should be no tax cut -  - on 1 July of this year. Let us make this point. If the Labor Party had been successful after 1 July in maintaining its opposition, every single Australian would be paying higher taxes today. The Labor Party policy was to oppose -  - If the Labor Party had its way, every Australian would be paying higher taxes today. Secondly, we would be reminding the Australian people that the government has legislated further tax cuts to take effect on 1 July of next year. The consequence of that is that only three per cent of Australians will be on the top marginal tax rate. I remind the House that the Labor Party's policy -  - And I will finish my answer, because the Labor Party hates to be reminded. The Labor Party opposes the tax cuts to take effect on 1 July next year on the grounds that they are for high-income earners. If the Labor Party had had its way, the Labor Party would have denied both this year's tax cuts and next year's as well.</DOC>

 - There is no doubt that further reform of the workplace relations system -  - will improve Australia's economic performance, increase jobs and enhance living standards. We have a strong economy now, but we need to keep working on it and ensure that we make fair and practical changes to continue to make progress. If you stand still, you effectively go backwards. People in regional areas like the electorate of the member for Barker will well remember the impacts of Labor's bungling in workplace relations and they have not forgotten the impact on residents in rural and regional Australia. There is far too much red tape and too much complexity. Some parts of the current system are just so confusing that employers have no chance of properly understanding them. When you consider that we have six different systems, 130 different pieces of industrial relations legislation and over 4,000 different awards, it is no wonder that there has been such confusion about the industrial relations arrangements.I have a practical example: Don runs a pastoral station that has a coffee and gift shop for tourists. His station hands are working under a federal award while his employees in the coffee and gift shop are employed under a state award. Don has to negotiate with the complexity of two workplace relations systems -  - meaning two sets of laws governing how his employees are treated, their different entitlements and how they can negotiate. Their unfair dismissal arrangements and their redundancy protections are different and, of course, he has different unions in the workplace. Under what we are proposing, all of his employees will be under the same workplace relations laws. They will have the same Australian fair pay and conditions standard. He will be able to deal with all of his staff with the same set of conditions, making all the mechanisms so much simpler. Don will be able to spend his time running his business instead of trying to sort out all of this confusion. Those are the sorts of changes that can make a real difference in our workplace, and it is high time the opposition got on board and started to support this kind of reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Comrie report also pointed out that the department has been doing the majority of its work very well. The Prime Minister said yesterday that, yes, the minister and the government accept that there are problems that have to be solved within the department of immigration. That is being done. As a matter of fact, as Senator Vanstone, the minister, pointed out last week, some $230 million is being set aside over the next five years to rehabilitate some aspects of what the department administers. For example, the Palmer implementation plan is in line with what the minister and the department outlined under Andrew Metcalfe, the new secretary.The $230 million is being spent on coming up with better ways of implementing the department's dealings with its clients, who are, let's face it, on the whole people who have come to Australia illegally or who have attempted to remain in Australia illegally. - One example is the establishment of the College of Immigration, Border Security and Compliance. It will deliver comprehensive, tailored operational training for departmental officers and will have an emphasis on quality assurance and decision making. Some 250 new departmental officers will be trained there every year and some 300 officers will be put through for refresher courses. The government accepts that the department has some issues to deal with, such as dealing with the health and wellbeing of clients. Also, information will flow through the department as to the background of illegal immigrants and people who are overstaying their visas. - The honourable member for Watson and those opposite are certainly -  - The member for Watson and those opposite in their questions are totally overlooking the fact that this department, since 2001, have done the job that the government asked them to do - dealing with illegal immigration in the order of what was looking like 12,000 or 13,000 boat people every year. Members opposite do not like this, because the people of Australia backed that policy to a 90 per cent degree. They may not like that option but it is a fact, and that is what the department did. When you have a job to do that is not always pleasant, it can be damned tough to do - and they did that job. We now have virtually no boat people coming to Australia at all because the department did that job under instructions. They did it well, and Australia agreed with that. What the members opposite do not like is the fact that Australia told them we were doing the right thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. The government's workplace relations reforms are vitally important to Australia's farming sector - employers and employees alike. At the outset, I remind and impress upon the House that WorkChoices will protect certain award conditions when the new workplace agreements are negotiated. The award conditions include: public holidays; rest breaks, including meal breaks; incentive based payments and bonuses; annual leave loadings; allowances; penalty rates; and shift and overtime loadings. The reforms will allow streamlined negotiations between employers and employees - and nowhere is this more needed than in regard to Australia's pastoral awards, which are mind-numbingly complex and a nightmare when trying to calculate entitlements and allowances. Let me give a couple of examples to prove the point. - In regard to the New South Wales pastoral award, there are some remarkable disincentives for employers and employees to reach agreement for mutual benefit, as well as for employers to employ people, which should be the main object of our policy, at least on this side of the House. Let me turn to clause 21(b), under 'Transport'. It states:... in all cases where the shearing shed is 400 metres or more walking distance from the employees' huts the employer shall provide transport from the shed to the huts and from the huts to the shed for the midday meal.The clause referring to 'Transport whilst at shed' states:Where the employees sleep at the employer's premises and the shearing shed is 800 metres or more walking distance from the employees' sleeping quarters, the employer shall provide transport for the employees between the shed and the sleeping quarters before the start of the day's work, and at the end of the day's work.At 400 metres you provide a minibus -  - and at 800 metres you provide a minibus when a few minutes walking is involved - which is good, of course, for fitness. 'Smoke-oh lunches' particularly grabs my eye. Clause 15(a) states:Where the shearing shed is within 229 metres' - not 228 or 300 metres - walking distance from the kitchen, smoke-oh lunches are to be held in the shed except:where an offsider is employed; orin the case of a cook of a mess of ten men or less.In country areas people are individualistic and self-reliant and do not need union officials prescribing one-size-fits all, complex and often irrelevant conditions of this kind.My favourite is under 'Special allowances', clause 37.1:Where a station hand is required by the employer to find the employee's own horse and/or saddle the employee shall be paid an allowance of $5.30 per week for the horse -  The member for Gorton then left the chamber. 
 - Let me start again with 'Special allowances', clause 37.1:Where a station hand is required by the employer to find the employee's own horse and/or saddle the employee shall be paid an allowance of $5.30 per week for the horse and an allowance of $4.23 per week for the saddle.For the horse, I can understand it - chaff and oats - but for the saddle? What is the equivalence between a horse and a saddle? That is a lot of beeswax for the saddle. It just goes on and on. This is what the Labor Party opposes: reform of this kind, whereby employers and employees can strike their own bargain. No wonder there has been a proliferation of shearing contract teams, harvesting contract teams and the like. The Labor Party want to return to the heavy hand of government and union regulation of this kind. This side of parliament does not.</DOC>

As I have made very plain, the government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs are putting in more resources than the opposition ever put into the department to make it the department it can be and which it has been.

 - I thank the member for Lindsay, who is a passionate advocate for the people from her area. She is fighting very hard for more opportunities - particularly school based new apprenticeship opportunities - for the people of the western suburbs of Sydney, in particular in her electorate. She comes from a state that has the distinction of being the last state to sign up to the 2005-08 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia's Workforce, the national training agreement. New South Wales was shamed into signing that agreement just last week.This agreement provides real reform of Australia's training system. It means that it can all now begin and that more training opportunities at the school based apprenticeship level for the people of Lindsay - and indeed all the people of New South Wales - should follow. We have eight separate training regimes - eight separate systems of entry, exit, assessment and so forth - in this country. We have supposedly been working under the theory of a national training system, but it is a bit like many of the things you see. The Labor Party know what it is, then they ignore it. The Labor Party states have gone out of their way to prevent a real recognition of the trade skills that people have had. In many ways, when this country federated in 1901 it was about dealing with tariffs on goods between the states. Instead, we now have tariffs on services, called licences and so forth.We now want a training system, and we can put in place a training system, in which Australian business recognise the gap between what it wants and what it gets. That should be what drives the way in which the training sector runs. It is not about the way in which the institutes and the unions which staff the institutes want to train people; it is, in fact, about getting real-time business demands at the beginning. We will back this initiative with funding of some $5 billion which will flow through this agreement until 2008. It includes an additional $215 million, which represents a real annual increase of $4.1 million compared with 2004. The states will match some of this funding, but additional funding is very good news.The states and territories have accepted the agreement. State owned TAFEs deliver some 85 per cent of the publicly funded training in this country. We need to improve the flexibility and the responsiveness of that public system. One of our priorities is to ensure greater access to Australian workplace agreements, which gives greater autonomy to TAFE directors to make decisions about staff who are performing well and who must be kept. We have to make sure that we end the haemorrhaging of the public education sector by having good teachers go off and take up opportunities in the private sector. One of the ways to keep them is to ensure that they can trade their experience and their abilities for more pay, better opportunities and more take-home pay as a result of their ability. That is what we are about.The Labor Party, of course, have their roll-back, their IR plan and their ambition to undo all of the good that we are currently doing. I have been asked about alternatives and there is one alternative the Labor Party might like to consider. My recent trip to the People's Republic of China and the second Sino-Australia VET forum produced an amazing observation from a senior Chinese official. I would like to put this on the Hansard record so the people of Australia understand that the Chinese understand what is going on far better than those opposite do. I quote:_ push vocational colleges and schools to change their management systems and operational mechanisms _ as well as _ make greater efforts to reform teachers' payment system, [including] relat[ing] staff income to the development of the school and link[ing] promotion with individual performance. [This includes] implement[ing] - it is very important that those opposite listen to this - a teacher-oriented system where salary is determined by different positions and performance. Motivate staff through this payment system.So you cannot help but wonder why, if senior officials of the Communist Party of China have got it, those opposite are the last gasps in the arguments against performance based pay through AWAs. Why is it? They have to update their logic in order to ensure that Australia can keep its skills up to date.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Australia exports 65 per cent of its farm produce and consequently we have a vital interest in breaking down distorted international trade caused by subsidies, restricted market access and the like. Farmers have been anxiously awaiting the successful conclusion of the Doha Round under the WTO in December in Hong Kong. There is a long way to go in reaching that goal, and so little time. However, some promising developments have emerged overnight from the WTO agricultural talks in Zurich, where various trade ministers have gathered, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, is in attendance. The United States has tabled at that meeting an initiative to cut its most trade-distorting farm subsidies by 60 per cent and to reduce other farm subsidies by 50 per cent. The United States has put this proposal in the context of a highly ambitious vision of eliminating all agricultural barriers within 15 years. That is 15 years too long for Australian farmers, but it is the first time we have had a timetable enunciated in that way.Promisingly, the European Union has responded to the initiative by increasing the extent to which it is prepared to cut its distorting farm subsidies - from 65 per cent to 70 per cent. There is no doubt that the United States proposal is a significant development that could help bring about a breakthrough in the current impasse in agricultural negotiations. The Minister for Trade has urged all WTO members to use the United States initiative as a building block to achieve tighter constraints on farm subsidies. It now falls on the European Union to take the courageous but necessary step of agreeing to improve market access in a way that delivers real commercial opportunities. There is no doubt that while elimination of subsidies is crucial to Australian farmers - because they give our competitors an unfair advantage in third markets - the No. 1 issue is market access. We must be able to trade in the various markets around the world and especially in the European Union. This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by all participating countries.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to an earlier question, we are not complacent about bird flu. I quoted the Commonwealth Medical Officer and, by the way, I think I am right in saying - the health minister will correct me if I am wrong - that the World Health Organisation also shares his view that there is a one in 10 chance that bird flu could mutate and therefore be transmitted between people. Obviously, if that were to happen, the consequences could be extremely serious.But I would have thought the government had been anything but complacent. Through the APEC processes we have been playing a leadership role. We did so back at the last APEC meeting in Chile, and we will be playing a very substantial leadership role at the meeting to take place at the end of this month in Brisbane of APEC senior officials from 21 countries. I think that, when we get to Pusan in South Korea for the APEC meetings next month, the government will find that -  - We left that years ago and now we are members of parliament. The public are interested in our policy positions not in our running a high school debating society. I would think that at the APEC meeting in Pusan next month the Prime Minister and other leaders will reach a solid agreement on regional action to deal with avian flu. I mentioned, in answer to an earlier question, that the government has already committed about $180 million to deal with avian flu, so to make a high school debating point suggesting that the government is doing nothing about it is to walk around being - and I use the word again because Mark Latham uses it so often in his book - an opportunist.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This is a very important issue. It concerns the question of voluntary membership, in the 21st century, of student unions. This government, and every member on this side of the House and the Liberal and National Parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, strongly believe that every one of the 715,000 Australian students who enrol in a university to receive an education should be free to decide whether or not they will part with hard-earned money to join a student union, guild or association. This government believes, firstly, in freedom of choice. Secondly, it believes that adult students should be free to choose which services they will or will not buy and subsidise on a university campus. We do not believe that in this, the 21st century, anybody should be telling an Australian university student what they will or will not pay for involuntarily.This is worth remembering. I take the House back two years ago, when this government passed an $11 billion reform package for Australian higher education. It was the first week of December 2003. In that week, on 5 December 2003, this government passed a package that would deliver $11 billion to universities over the next 10 years. It was also the week when the Labor Party chose a new leader. Mr Mark Latham was chosen on 2 December that year. On 5 December, the day that this legislation went through the parliament, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:I think we'll make a great team, and I certainly look forward to working with Mr Latham. I think we'll be able to make sure we get our message across very clearly.In that week, on Sunday, 7 December, Mr Latham recorded in his diary that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - In relation to education and higher education reform -  - Mr Latham, on 7 December, two days after the reform package went through the parliament, said of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his diary:Jenny is totally ineffective. - Mr Latham, the then Leader of the Labor Party, actually said this of the Deputy Leader:You might as well not have one. Macklin is as useful as pockets in your underpants. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. The member is unforgettably associated with policies that seek to balance concerns with the environment with the protection of the jobs of Australian working men and women. He asks me what the significance of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is. Well may the member acknowledge my interest in this matter, and I acknowledge his. I praise his interest in this matter, Mr Speaker, through you. The partnership represents the best opportunity for effective, concerted action by Australia and like-affected and like-minded countries in our region and elsewhere to build a sustainable basis for improving our climate, tackling greenhouse gas emissions and doing so in a manner that does not detract from development and job creation in Australia.I will quote from some recent comments on this:The Asia-Pacific partnership is aimed at promoting investments in clean energy technology and its membership is certainly impressive. It's got the world's four largest economies, the United States, China, Japan and India. By any measure, the six countries in the Asia-Pacific Partnership - Australia, the United States, Japan, China, India and South Korea - represent a regional partnership of great significance and even greater opportunity. The other five participants are all key trading partners of Australia. Together they constitute 45 per cent of the world's population, 49 per cent of the world's gross domestic product and 48 per cent of the world's energy consumption.In making those comments, I have been reading extensively from a speech delivered last night, 11 October, by the member for Batman, who is the shadow minister for primary industries, resources, forestry and tourism. I would like to applaud the remarks of the member for Batman. I think that the member for Batman on this issue has demonstrated - as he did on the Tasmanian forest issue - that he at least understands that protecting the jobs of Australians is more important than selling out to inner-metropolitan elites in return for green preferences. The fellow who sits next to him, the member for Grayndler, is not so popular in a certain electorate in Tasmania that is represented by another member of the Labor Party who is very interested in the jobs of Australians, Dick Adams. What the shadow minister was saying last night was sheer commonsense. He was expressing support for the government's policy. I welcome that. I think an element of bipartisanship on this issue would do the public interest and the public concern a great deal of good. - I notice that the member for Grayndler starts interjecting. The member for Grayndler has been sidelined by the member for Batman on this issue. The member for Grayndler is somebody who thought that selling out workers to get green preferences was a good idea. He was more worried about green preferences in Grayndler than the jobs of Australians in Tasmania - just as he is more concerned about green preferences than he is about the jobs of Australians when it comes to protecting our industry. Kyoto has always been inadequate for Australia's interests. It was never right for Australia to sign up to Kyoto. Those in the Labor Party who advocated that we should have signed up to Kyoto were selling out the working men and women in the resource sector of Australia.I welcome the fact that the member for Batman has realised that. Just as he quite rightly said that the people of northern Tasmania voted for the job security policy of the coalition in the last election and rejected the jobs-destroying policies of the Labor Party on that occasion, so on this occasion he is rightly endorsing the partnership on clean energy and development and recognising the challenged nature of the Kyoto arrangement. I applaud the remarks of the member for Batman. Maybe it evinces a change of attitude on the part of the Labor Party and a return to some interest in actual job security instead of job destruction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I think the honourable member for Solomon, like most members of this House, is very conscious of today and the opportunity that we had this morning to remember the 202 victims of the tragedy of the 12 October 2002 bombings, which took - amongst the lives of those 202 people - 88 Australians. The grim outcome of terrorism has taken more innocent lives since then, including a further four Australians, in what should have been an opportunity for peace and enjoyment in a very delightful part of the world.Mr Speaker, my colleague and yours the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Bali today to remember the victims. I know that, on behalf of the Australian government and the people of Australia, he has extended condolences to the families and the loved ones of those who lost their lives tragically there. Many in this House and in the Senate came together in the gardens of the parliament this morning not only to mourn but also to celebrate the lives and the stories, hopes and aspirations of each person and their families, who were so sadly affected.On these matters, our communities in Bali and here in Australia are working together. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced recently, the Australian government will provide medical equipment and support totalling more than $1 million to meet the immediate and longer terms needs of the blast victims and their communities in Bali. We have seen the substantial way in which those facilities were able to assist people injured on this more recent occasion.But the bombings do serve to reaffirm the importance of our efforts in the fight against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world. The horrific attacks in Bali have been committed by people who preach a twisted ideology of hate - an ideology that has no place in our open society and in peace-loving societies around the world. It is an ideology that I believe is abhorrent to people of all religions. Practical cooperation between Australia and the Indonesian law enforcement agencies has already helped to secure the arrest, trial and conviction of some 40 people in relation to the events of October 2002. Again our police and other agencies are working to track down the perpetrators of the latest atrocity and to ensure that they are brought to justice. I am sure that all members of the House will wish them well in those efforts.</DOC>

I would remind the House that this is not a situation where these advertisements are something that has never been done before, either at a state or a federal level. Given the significance of the changes - even those who sit opposite argue, rather extravagantly on occasions, that these changes are the most momentous and the most radical in years; they are big changes, but they are fair changes - it is therefore justifiable, entirely defensible and entirely proper that advertisements providing factual information, as these advertisements do - very factual - be run and I make no apology for running them.</DOC>

I can tell him that today Westpac released its consumer sentiment index for the month of October, showing a modest fall in consumer confidence of 1.6 per cent; however, the fall did take consumer sentiment below the index of 100. Reasons for the fall most probably relate to extensive coverage of the recent Bali bombings during the period when public opinion was surveyed. Undoubtedly, another factor contributing to a dampening of consumer sentiment is petrol prices, which are still very high, causing considerable pain to motorists and consumers, and which are bad for business and bad for the economy.Over the last year, world oil prices have increased by 21 per cent. Prices at Australia's petrol bowsers have increased from around a dollar a litre a year ago to around $1.25 per litre today. There has been some moderation in petrol prices over the last few weeks, with prices at Australian bowsers now around 6c a litre lower than they were in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Recent movements in world oil and petrol prices suggest that there may be some further reduction coming, with the price of unleaded petrol in Singapore falling again by two per cent over the last two weeks.This weekend in Beijing, the Group of 20 - central bankers and finance ministers - will hold their annual meeting, which I will be attending together with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. There will be discussion of the state of the world economy, the greatest threat to which at the moment is abnormally high oil prices. The abnormally high oil prices are a consequence of strong demand with limited supply, the demand particularly coming out of China and the limited supply being a combination of factors, including instability in the Middle East and lack of investment in production capacity.Notwithstanding these matters and the undoubted effect that they are having on consumer sentiment, underlying economic indicators are favourable. Mortgage interest rates are at historical lows, more Australians are in work than ever before, unemployment is at its lowest rate in 29 years and household incomes are growing strongly. With further economic reform, we have the capacity to drive the Australian economy with continuing growth in the year ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Along with all the other members of the government, he is interested in creating jobs for young Australians. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, address caucus and attempt to tell them that young people would be disadvantaged by the WorkChoices system. The WorkChoices system includes expanded safeguards for young Australian workers. For example, if a young person under the age of 18 - a young person of 15, 16 or 17 - is interested in going onto an individual Australian workplace agreement, in order for that agreement to be entered into and to be valid they will not only need to sign it themselves but will also need the consent of their parent or their guardian. This is a guarantee which has never existed before.As the Prime Minister keeps saying, the government's guarantee on youth employment, as with other employment, is its record. Of course, that also applies to the opposition. Remember that when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in the Labor government teenage unemployment in Australia was 34.5 per cent. There was a very revealing interview on The 7.30 Report on 6 May 1993, when Mr Beazley was the employment minister. He was asked:So this group - that is, the unemployed - are being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap.Mr Beazley said:Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement.Contrast that statement with this one from another Labor leader, who said:You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place, because if we as a government and you as the trades union movement do not make Britain a country of successful business, a country where people want to set up and expand and a country that has the edge over our competitors, then we are betraying those we represent.They were the words of a modern, realistic Labor leader - namely, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair. What Tony Blair was saying was that every young person in his country should have the opportunity of getting a job. What we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was a statement which confirmed that it was better for young people in this country to stay on welfare than to get a job. That is a shameful position from a man who presided over teenage unemployment in this country of 34.5 per cent.There is one other thing about the Leader of the Opposition. In 1993, when Paul Keating and the then Labor government brought in the first wave of industrial relations changes in this country, changes to move people away from the rigidities of the awards and to open up agreement making in this country, the then minister for employment, Kim Beazley, voted for those changes. But what do we see opportunistically today? We see the Leader of the Opposition wanting to roll back the changes that were made then. - In 1993 this man voted for changes, and today he wants to roll them back. Weak!</DOC>

 - The government has indicated that it will be meeting its commitments in relation to the Calder Highway. I find it passing strange to hear a Labor Party member ask when this government will match the promises of the Bracks Labor state government on roads. The Bracks Labor state government engaged in the most callous breach of promise I have ever seen in Australian politics. - This was a government that wrote to every member of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne before the last state election and said that, if it was elected, it would build a freeway.The member for Bendigo then left the chamber. - No, I have not finished, Mr Speaker. I most certainly have not finished - not by a long shot. The people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne know this point: when the Australian Labor Party makes a promise before the election to build a freeway, that promise cannot be guaranteed and it cannot be trusted. What is more, those opposite now worry amongst themselves: if the Bracks Labor government can put a toll on the Scoresby Freeway, what is to say that it will not put a toll on the Deer Park bypass and what is to say that it will not put a toll on another national highway. Let me say this: every promise of a Labor government -  - in relation to roads is a Scoresby promise and cannot be believed. - Unfortunately, the member for Bendigo has been expelled from the parliament. The people of Bendigo will know that their representative was not in the parliament today to debate these issues. He was not here to represent the people of Bendigo in relation to these issues, because he was incapable of proper parliamentary behaviour. The record will show the people of Bendigo that the member for Bendigo was so concerned about roads in Bendigo that he engaged in unparliamentary behaviour and has been expelled; he was not here to represent them. At the time of the next election, we will be back in the electorate of Bendigo and we will be explaining to the people of Bendigo that at the next election they will have the opportunity of getting a member who at least can turn up and stay throughout a question time.</DOC>

 - I cannot overlook the interjections of the Leader of the Opposition. Anyone who wants a character analysis of the Leader of the Opposition is welcome to read a certain diary. I would recommend it. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time; in fact, I am now reading it a second time. It gets better the second time around.Today the Prime Minister and I announced a task force which will consider all areas of Commonwealth government regulation with the object of identifying specific areas which are unnecessarily burdensome, complex or redundant or which duplicate regulations. It will indicate those areas in which regulation should be removed or significantly reduced as a matter of priority and it will examine non-regulatory options, including self-regulation. It will also provide practical options for alleviating government red tape.The Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, will head this prestigious committee. He will be joined by Mr Dick Humphry, a former managing director of the Australian Stock Exchange; Mr Rod Halstead, a corporate law expert; and Mrs Angela McCrae, who has experience with small business. - This is a prestigious committee which will be able to identify those areas and which of course will be important in reducing the regulatory burden. Over the years, many regulatory burdens on business are introduced in response to specific events or specific failures of public policy. For example, in the corporate area, a number were introduced in response to the HIH royal commission as a result of the royal commissioner's report and a number were introduced as a consequence of events overseas such as Enron and the changes in US law under the Sarbanes-Oxley act. Although these measures one by one may be good legislative responses, cumulatively they can -  - become an unnecessary burden. That is why it is important that we have a task force which can report by 31 January 2006 and actually identify those things.Can I also point out that another reason why unnecessary burdens have been introduced in some respects is that in order to secure legislation through the Senate the government has been forced to accept amendments from the Labor Party which in many areas have increased regulation. The opportunity to reconsider those matters, which have been forced on the government by the Senate in years gone by, will also be very important to this review.This is a breakthrough announcement in relation to a task force which has considerable expertise and wide terms of reference, which has a short period of time in which to report, which can make a big contribution and which is part of the microeconomic reform challenge - the ongoing reform to keep the Australian economy growing and profitable and to create more jobs.</DOC>

 - This government believes that the department must at all times act with due regard to the law and due process, and that is what they did in this case. It is a very sad case. Ms Agha came out here on a six-month visitors visa. She was assessed by her local doctor as being fit to travel prior to that. In the course of her visa running out of time the department, as they are legally bound to do, contacted her. They found out that she was not well. They then asked the public health service to check out her health. As a result of that they then wrote to her asking her to talk to them about her visa situation. At no time was she told she would be deported; at no time was it suggested that she would be. They simply wanted to talk to her about her visa position in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield, who was elected triumphantly to this House in part because of the strong health policies of the Howard government. Support for private health insurance is one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to government policies like Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate, private coverage has increased from 30 per cent and falling to 43 per cent. That means that almost nine million Australians now have the security and choice that private cover gives, including nearly one million people earning incomes of less than $20,000 a year.I have been asked about alternative policies. Labor wants to rip the guts out of the private health insurance rebate. That would cost the average privately insured family $1,000 a year. How do we know this? We know Labor's secret plans because Labor's former leader has revealed them to us. In many ways the Latham Diaries is a vile book, but it helps to explain why modern Labor is no longer the party of Curtin and Chifley - or even the party of Hawke and Keating. The Latham Diaries say that on 22 February 2000:Costello - that is to say, the Leader of the Opposition's former chief of staff - told me that the private health insurance rebate would be one of the first things abolished in our promises. Macklin despises the rebate and wants to poleaxe it. At different times Beazley has boasted to caucus that it will go.Then on Wednesday 6 August 2003, when Mr Latham was the shadow Treasurer, his diaries say:An excellent meeting with Coxy and staff to draw up a list of quality cuts to the budget -  -  - Yes, he is gone too! The diaries say:including parliamentary superannuation and the private health insurance rebate.The rebate that they said they were keeping, they were secretly planning to scrap. What does it say about the Australian Labor Party that they made Mark Latham their leader? What does it say about the Leader of the Opposition that they preferred Latham to him? What these diaries show is that, when it comes to private health insurance, you just cannot trust Labor. The Australian people know that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. They also know that the Howard government is the only friend that private health insurance has.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the member for Cowan that Anzac Day will remain sacrosanct and sacred in Australia. There will be nothing in these changes that will alter what now obtains. Anzac Day will remain a public holiday. At present many Australians are required as part of their employment to work on Anzac Day. The circumstances in which they are remunerated for that are governed by their awards and their agreements. That will not change under the new system anymore than the arrangements, for example, for opening stores on Boxing Day. We have post-Christmas sales on Boxing Day. The way some of the propaganda has come out in the last few days you would imagine that those uttering those things -  - With great respect - and I do respect the member for Cowan - I have dealt with the issue of Anzac Day. I think it is reasonable and proper, because Anzac Day along with other days is a public holiday in this country, to amplify my answer by reference to other days - and I intend to do that. I think the House is entitled to hear the answer in full. - There are thousands of Australians now who are required to work as part of their jobs on public holidays. - Any suggestion that we are dramatically altering that, or indeed altering that at all, is completely wrong. Right now under the present law, and under the law before 1996, people could be required to work on Anzac Day, they could be required to work on Boxing Day, they could be required to work on other public holidays, and the remuneration was determined according to their award or their agreement. That will be the same under the new law. There has been absolutely no change at all, and the attempt by the Labor Party and others to suggest otherwise is completely wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Australian farmers and farm workers are drowning in a sea of hundreds of complex and barely decipherable state and federal awards. The awards are across eight jurisdictions and, whilst the pastoral awards are the best known, there are literally hundreds of awards dealing with different commodities and sectors of the agricultural industry. The horticultural industry award for New South Wales is long, complex, expensive and a deterrent to employment. That is just one of several hundred awards of a similar type affecting, directly or indirectly, the horticultural industry.Yesterday I drew attention to one aspect of the federal pastoral award, which was the allowance for a horse and an allowance for a saddle. Members may recall that the allowance if you provide a horse is $5.30 per week and $4.23 per week for a saddle, which comes to $9.53 for horse and saddle. Let us compare that to the South Australian pastoral award. Here you get $5.03 per week for a horse -  - and $4.02 for a saddle. That makes only $9.05 for horse and saddle. What is the difference between the federal expense and the South Australian expense? Let us go to the Queensland Rabbit Board award. If you are an employee of the Queensland Rabbit Board and supply a horse, you get paid $3.16 and only $2.50 for a saddle, but fodder is thrown in. So you get $5.66 per week for horse and saddle and all fodder, so the horse is looked after. It is a pity about the saddle. Now I look at the Northern Territory cattle industry award. Sorry, there is no horse allowance here but there is a saddle allowance. You get $3.70 per week while the saddle is in use, but nothing for a horse, so where you put the saddle is beyond me. There are thousands of stories -  -  - I am happy to come back every day. - The New South Wales pastoral award really caught my eye. To give you an idea of the minutiae and the intervention, it actually details what a cook has to keep in a pantry: rice, butter, vegetables, to be sure -  - The New South Wales pastoral award lists on a schedule about 30 items that a cook has to stock in the pantry - fair enough. But what are tapioca and sago?The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - You have to supply suet, cream of tartar and essence in the pantry. The point is that these awards are a deterrent to employment; these awards are job killers in country areas. So long as there are thousands if not tens of thousands of pages where the Labor Party together with union bosses try to dictate every aspect of every arrangement for an employee and an employer, we will not reach the full potential of job creation in country areas.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and let me inform the House of the extent of the dishonest selective quoting that the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in. I did say what he said in answer to that question. I then went on to say, when asked about Christmas Day:Look, no, no, the answer's no. Nothing is going to change in these areas.In answer to a further question from Mitchell:But are they going to be up for negotiation?my reply was:They are going to be in no different position than they are now.I heard the Leader of the Opposition this morning being interviewed on Radio National. I listened over my breakfast to the Leader of the Opposition. I can only describe it as a torrent -  - I listened to the Leader of the Opposition quietly, patiently and carefully. I can only describe it as a torrent of breathless opportunism that the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to say to the Australian public that he wanted to take Australia down the high-wage road, contrary to the low-wage road of the coalition. This is a man who was part of a government that presided over and boasted about a rise of 2.1 per cent in real wages in 13 years, and I am the Prime Minister who has presided over an economy that has delivered a 14.9 per cent rise in real wages over the last 9½ years.There is only one thing at issue in this debate about industrial relations, and that is which side of politics has the capacity to deliver the policies that will grow the Australian economy to maintain the high living standards, the low unemployment, the high productivity and the growing job opportunities of 2005. As I have said before, the worth of any industrial relations policy is the contribution it makes to the strength of the economy. A strong economy delivers job security, higher wages and better conditions. All the rules in the world cannot legislate to prevent a recession from destroying the jobs of Australians. - This country had the most regulated labour market imaginable in the early 1990s. It did not stop Mr Keating and the other ministers in his government from presiding over one million unemployed. It did not stop real wages from going into free fall. It did not stop hundreds of thousands of small businesses from going broke. - They may have had their regulations, and they may have had their awards, but the net effect of those awards was to enfeeble the Australian economy. When you have an enfeebled economy, you have high unemployment, low wages and bad working conditions. That is the path of Labor. It was the path of Keating Labor, and it would be the path of Beazley Labor.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to tell the honourable member for Cowper that, at long last, New South Wales has signed the AusLink agreement. At long last, New South Wales will have the benefit of this significant increase in funding for road and rail infrastructure in the state - around $2½ billion for major new land transport projects and road maintenance; $3.778 billion altogether in Commonwealth assistance to New South Wales road and rail. This will mean a significant boost to the capacity to build major new road projects in that state. - The AusLink investment, for instance, will provide significant money for Westlink, in Sydney, and the Albury upgrade. - Of particular interest to the member for Cowper, the Pacific Highway upgrade and the Bonville Deviation at last should be able to get under way. There will also be around $1.4 billion for rail transport around Australia, the large majority of which will go to New South Wales. So this is a significant boost in funding for the infrastructure of New South Wales. It comes at a time when the New South Wales government itself has record flows of GST moneys and stamp duty revenues. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a major boost in road construction activities in the state of New South Wales.This funding represents a 78 per cent increase over the last five years in Commonwealth government assistance for roads in New South Wales. I have to say that I was absolutely staggered to hear Mr Tripodi, the latest Minister for Roads in New South Wales, say that this deal will mean that New South Wales will have to sack 300 employees. How can a 78 per cent increase in funding result in 300 fewer jobs? We want hundreds of extra jobs to get on with building these projects. There can be only one of two reasons why the New South Wales government have to sack people because they have received an increase: either they have been cheating on the Australian government for a long time or, alternatively, they are going to slash their own expenditure on roads to a level that no New South Wales motorist should tolerate.We expect the New South Wales government to go out and employ extra people and to do it quickly. There has already been a three-month unnecessary delay in projects such as the Bonville Deviation. These projects should be already under way, but New South Wales dillydallied under AusLink. Now that the agreement has at last been signed, get on with the job and employ the extra people that will be necessary to undertake these projects so New South Wales can get the road and rail system it properly deserves.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member for Richmond: not only, of course, did she neglect to refer to the other parts of the interview but the actual answer she gave deliberately left out the next sentence, which said:Nothing is going to change in these areas.I know the Labor Party is into opportunism, but I would counsel the newer members of the Australian Labor Party not to get conned by the old hands on the tactics committee. Because this is an important issue -  - let me just remind the House again that it has habitually been the case that many tens of thousands of Australians have worked on public holidays. Everybody knows that police and nurses, for example, work on public holidays. People know that. There are quite a number of members of this House who are here through the support and patronage of the shop, distributive and allied union, and many of their members - The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - There are many people who belong to that union who have habitually worked on public holidays. It is the case now that, if you work on a public holiday, your remuneration is governed by the terms of your award or your agreement. That will be the case under our law in the future. That is the basis of my claim, and that is the basis of completely disproving the allegations made by the members of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. There is one simple fact - that is, under the coalition government millions of Australian workers can choose. They can choose where their own superannuation, their retirement nest egg, is invested. This is a policy that the Labor Party rejected and opposed for nine years. They objected to Australian workers having the right to choose a low-fee fund. - The Labor Party objected to workers of Australia having the right to choose a high return on their fund, a fund that provides good service. These are the things that the Labor Party said that the Australian workers were not entitled to have. In an article in today's Age newspaper, it was suggested that when employees negotiate an AWA with their employer they will lose their superannuation choice rights. This is simply wrong. Workers on AWAs retain the right to negotiate superannuation matters with their employers. Effective choice is made at the time of negotiation. There is no removal of this right. Under the new IR proposals, workers' rights will be protected. They will have the same rights as they have now. There are many on the other side who have objected to this, and there are those in the union movement who have objected to this.In the article today there are quotes from a Mr Garry Weaven. Mr Garry Weaven was the former Assistant Secretary of the ACTU. He is a heavyweight and a current superannuation executive and a former heavyweight in the union movement. He says the workers will be unable to claim unpaid superannuation contributions, as they will be unable to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. This, again, is wrong. The ATO is responsible for the enforcement of the payment of compulsory superannuation, which is the ALP's own legislation. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission inform me that they do not generally have the jurisdiction to recover the money; that is the ATO's responsibility. This protection will remain. The comments by the ALP and the comments by former union bosses reflect one thing - that is, Australian workers under an ALP government would not be given the right to choose a low-fee, high-return, high-service superannuation fund. That is what the coalition stands for, today and into the future.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the testimony given by General Casey. I am also aware of separate assessments made by the Australian military that indicate that the security forces in Iraq which operate in the areas where Australians are deployed are improving in capability. That gives us grounds for some optimism. It is also the case that, when I visited Al Muthanna province in July, both the Australian military people to whom I spoke and the British military commander who came from Basra spoke positively of the improvements which had taken place in relation to the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.It is a slow process. I think that is self-evident. But it is a very difficult task that the Iraqi security forces face. There are really two choices in Iraq. We can either persevere in the belief which the government holds that, through perseverance, a stable country will emerge, capable of looking after itself, or we can do as the opposition wants to do and cut and run and condemn the people of Iraq to the chaos, disorder and -  - The question asked by the member for Griffith shows very clearly the different approach that the two sides of this parliament have as to whether or not Iraq should be given the hope of a democratic future. The Labor Party do not believe in a democratic future for Iraq, whereas we on this side of the House do. Giving Iraq a democratic future will require the continued presence of coalition forces for some time into the future. I have no intention of foolishly, or without any proper grounds for doing so, making myself or this government hostage to a particular date. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith can ask as many questions as they like. Nothing will alter the fact that they do not really want a democratic Iraq. Their policy will condemn Iraq to years of chaos, terrorism and internal disorder. Our policy, on the other hand, will give to the people of Iraq the hope of a democratic future.Let me say, through the House to the people of Iraq, that I hope I speak on behalf of all Australians in saying that we would like to see a massive turnout at the referendum over the weekend. If there is a high turnout at the weekend, it will demonstrate the determination of the people of Iraq. It is very well for us to make fine speeches against the background of uninterrupted democracy but, when you are fighting to establish a democratic country in the face of the most fearful terrorism, your behaviour is to be admired. It should not be sneered at, as has been the case with the member for Griffith.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for raising this issue. Today, along with other members of the house - including the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Health and Ageing - I launched Carers Week. In the course of doing so, I was able to speak of a number of things that have been done by this government to expand the support for the magnificent carers of Australia. They comprise some 2.5 million Australians who are engaged in different ways in the informal voluntary care sector. They are amongst the most impressive, inspiring and praiseworthy of our fellow citizens. On this occasion, at the commencement of Carers Week, I want to say to all of our fellow Australians who are engaged in care: we are profoundly in your debt. You enrich the character of our national life, and we owe you something that can never be properly expressed or properly repaid.The government has enhanced in many ways support for carers, particularly over the last few years. We have announced significant enhancements in the formal care sector. For the past two budgets we have had additional one-off supplements both in relation to the carers allowance and the carer payment: $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients. In the 2004 budget we announced a $2.2 billion investment in the formal and informal aged care sectors. In this year's budget we announced $207.6 million over four years to expand access to respite care. In September, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced $57 million to extend carer payment to carers of children with severe intellectual, psychiatric or behavioural disabilities.I am pleased to say that I announced today at the opening of Carers Week a new initiative of the government: a package worth some $200 million that will allow ageing parents of children with disabilities, amongst other things, to establish private trusts of up to $500,000 for the future care of their children without being affected by social security, gifting and means testing.This is a very significant structural change. It will affect many families with ageing parents who wish to sell a large home and downsize on the basis that their disabled child might go into some other kind of residence. Under existing arrangements, the money provided for that other residence would be deemed a continuing asset and be caught by the means or assets test. That will no longer be the case when these new arrangements come into operation and, whilst I am not suggesting for a moment that this is going to meet all of the needs of carers in our community, it is a very significant step forward.I take the opportunity of paying tribute to Senator Kay Patterson, the Minister for Family and Community Services, who has campaigned long and hard for this change. She, more than anybody else in the government, has been responsible for this change with her persistence, her compassion and her commitment. It will bring relief and it will solve the thing that I have found in interviews with elderly parents of disabled adult children that bothers them most: 'What will happen to our child when we die? Will they be properly cared for?' As I said, it does not solve every problem - I am not pretending that - but it is a significant improvement. It will meet a need. I think it can be seen as part of an ongoing program by this government to expand the support we provide for a section of the community to whom we owe so much - that is, the 2½ million carers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member reluctantly for the question she has asked. In relation to these matters, the decisions are mine and mine alone. I took advice from my department in relation to demographic matters. It certainly was aware of the choices that I was considering. I cannot comment on whether or not there are specifically centres in the electorates that have been mentioned, but I will check the matter, but it was irrelevant to the choices that were made.What I can say about the members of parliament who have served and will continue to serve on the task force that is advising on the broad implementation of these matters, but not on the choice of centres, is that they come from those parts of Australia where they have, with their contacts within their electorates, very considerable experience and capacity to advise and assist on these matters. I make no apologies whatsoever for involving those members in giving advice on the way in which those matters in their electorates that they are familiar with ought to be addressed.I have been asked a specific question about whether or not the members will be involved in the choice of those who tender. As to who will be successful, I can assure you they will not be involved in that process. I do not regard it as being appropriate. I think it would not fit with appropriate probity guidelines for them to be involved in that process and they have not been asked to undertake such a process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. As his colleagues on this side of the House have quickly found out, he has considerable capacity and ability and a great deal of interest in the issue of families and keeping families together. He has produced some very erudite papers on these matters, which I would encourage all members of the parliament to read and consider.Today I had the pleasure of being joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Wakefield, when I spoke with families at a public meeting here in Parliament House about the government's family law reforms. As members would know, we are embarking upon the most significant reforms in 30 years. Around Australia, we will be changing the landscape of the way in which family relationships are managed. Separation will no longer be seen as just a legal matter that you battle over in the courts. What we want is a situation where parents will be encouraged to sit down together and sort out what is best for their children. At the heart of this cultural change will be our new family relationship centres. I have previously announced that 15 of those centres will be opened by the middle of next year. Today I announced that the remaining 50 centres, to complete the network of 65 centres, will be rolled out progressively in the following two years. These new centres, along with the strong emphasis we are placing on outreach, will cover the nation. From Cairns to Campbelltown, and from the Pilbara to Launceston, families will have a place where they can go to get help. Having travelled around the country consulting with families on the role of these centres, I know they will make a real difference.Unfortunately, not everybody in the parliament shares that view. In fact, what we have found - and the Leader of the Opposition might like to know this in relation to his colleagues - is that some of them seek to trivialise the matter. The salad bar analogy used recently by the member for Gellibrand poses some very significant questions because, whilst this government is providing 'healthy' alternatives to help parents resolve their family relationship issues in a way that does not end up in court, the Labor Party offers little more than salad dressing. One piece of advice I can give to the member for Gellibrand - and her colleagues probably share this view - is that she should get on board and support the government's generational changes to the family law system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his championing of small businesses in his electorate on the New South Wales coast. Small businesses in Australia will be able to increase employment through, amongst other things, the removal of the unfair dismissal laws - through increased flexibility - which will enable them to take on extra staff. Yesterday we saw the animosity towards small businesses in Australia from the ACTU in an exchange between ACTU President Greg Combet and Richard Glover on ABC radio. An employer rang in pointing out that, because of the inflexibility in the current workplace relations system, he was unable to offer an extra shift to a 21-year-old employee. Instead, he and his wife had to do the work, resulting in less money for the employee and, of course, the employer and his wife missing time with their family. He asked Mr Combet, 'What about when the shoe is on the other foot, Greg?' There was an awkward pause on the radio and then Mr Combet said, 'I'm afraid I'm not a small business advocate.' That is only too true.This hostile attitude towards small business was also revealed in The Latham Diaries. On page 179 of his book, talking about Greg Combet's attitude towards attempts by the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, to reform the ALP, Mr Latham said:Already, the dinosaurs are digging in. Greg Combet is in the media saying that he opposes reform because it might mean having small business representation at Labor Party conferences.Mr Combet made another comment yesterday which I am sure the House will find of interest. At the very time the union movement is railing against changes to industrial relations in Australia and workplace agreements which allow the trade-off of conditions such as penalty rates and the like, Greg Combet, speaking yesterday on the Richard Glover show on the ABC, said:I've negotiated numerous agreements where we negotiate, say, an all-up payment, an all-up rate in lieu of, you know, penalty rates for working shiftwork or weekends.Mr Combet, on one hand, rails against this flexibility and, on the other hand, says, 'I have negotiated these flexible types of agreements.' But it is not just Mr Combet. Here is an extract from a certified agreement, one of the parties to which is the Australian Workers Union, which is headed by -  - the other Billy, whose employment prospects are to come in here. Clause 7 of this AWU certified agreement reads:Payment for public holidays, whether worked or falling during an off-duty period, has been averaged and is included in the calculation of the flat hourly rate.There are other examples of this. I will not take the time of the House to -  
Government members - Go on! - One more - again the Australian Workers Union, again Bill Shorten's union. This is another certified agreement of which one of the parties before the Industrial Relations Commission was the Australian Workers Union. Clause 3.1(a) says:Wages are for all hours worked.It goes on to say they include a loading for hours worked in excess of 12 hours per day et cetera - and this point: 'as well as hours worked on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays'. There it is: 'Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays'. What this demonstrates is the essential dishonesty of the ACTU and the Labor Party's campaign. What they are doing is this: on one hand they are out there trying to scare the workers of Australia, saying that this sort of flexibility is something that we do not have, yet on the other hand they are in the Industrial Relations Commission negotiating the same flexibility - hypocrites!</DOC>

 - I am indebted to the member for Perth for asking that question. He mentioned a number of firms. Let me start with Jackson Wells Morris. It is probably well known in this House that, although Grahame Morris is no longer associated with that firm, he is my close friend - we have a very close friendship. He was a political adviser of mine over a number of years and is a person for whom I have enormous regard. The Wells is a former journalist who was my press secretary during one of my unsuccessful stints as the Leader of the Opposition - it seems to be a habit in this place to have unsuccessful stints as opposition leader. He was also press secretary to Andrew Peacock. But the Keith Jackson was, I think in either the 1970s or 1980s, the Labor candidate for Mackellar.A member of the advisory board to that company was none other than Kerry Sibraa. There is also a gentleman - I know this gentleman and I have a very high regard for him - whose surname is Cook, who is a senior adviser to that firm and was in fact either the principal private secretary or the senior adviser to John Dawkins when he was minister for education in the former Labor government. I suppose you could say that firm qualifies unconditionally as a group of Howard government mates! You might say that, but I think you would be stretching it a bit far. The processes of this have been correct, and the fact that you happen to have an association with the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, if you have the ability, should not disqualify you. If you want a bit of field evidence for that going back to the time the Labor Party was in office, have a look at what Rod Cameron did for former Labor governments.</DOC>

 - Certainly people who live in rural and regional Australia - 40 per cent of Australian families - want an industrial relations system that is flexible and able to provide particular benefits and tailored agreements to meet their needs. The employment agreements that can meet the individual circumstances of families that perhaps have to travel long distances will obviously have significant benefits in rural and regional areas. Families want flexibility, small business wants flexibility and we have just heard that unions want flexibility. The only people that do not want flexibility, it seems, are the members opposite. They want a staid, rules driven industrial relations system that cannot allow businesses to take advantage of their opportunities or families to negotiate an arrangement which enables them to have the very best possible lifestyle.WorkChoices will provide the real opportunity for families to negotiate a family friendly working arrangement. It will give them opportunities in relation to appropriate leave and family friendly arrangements, including personal and carers leave whenever that is necessary for their families. That is the kind of flexibility that it seems members opposite think is inappropriate. And, what is more, they do not want the public to hear about it. They do not want the truth, they do not want anything said about what is being proposed in this legislation and they do not want the public to be given information. All they want is to have distorted trade union campaigns endeavouring to tear apart these changed arrangements. Families that live in rural and regional Australia that might have to travel long distances may well choose a working arrangement that gives them the opportunity to work for longer hours and then have longer periods off. That is the kind of thing that unions are happy to negotiate on behalf of their members, but Labor opposite wants to put an end to that kind of thing.The strong economic performance that we have seen in Australia, the growth in our economy since the first tranche of industrial relations reform in 1996, ought to really be an inspiration for us to go further at this stage. The honourable member for Hinkler has noted in his own area the extraordinary drop in unemployment and the growth in business. We are in adjoining electorates and for many years we have had amongst the highest unemployment rates in the country. It is magnificent to see the drop in unemployment over recent times. That is very much about having a growing economy that is built on a flexible workplace. It is important that Labor should set aside its opposition to this proposed flexible new system. They boasted when they were in government how they kept wages down. We want a system that provides an opportunity for people to earn more in circumstances that fit their own family needs and also, as a result, to build strong and progressive businesses, because the progress and development of our country is very much dependent upon having a very successful business environment.</DOC>

I am not attempting in any way to disguise the fact that the government have embarked upon a public information campaign to explain the rationale for these changes. We regard it as utterly defensible. It was challenged before the High Court of Australia by the Labor Party and the unions, and when I last checked that challenge was unsuccessful.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. The member for Hume is eminently qualified to speak, drawing on his life experiences as well as his experiences of the excesses of union power and intervention in the workplace. He spent 32 years in the meat processing industry and several years of that time on the floor of a meatworks. He can tell stories about being forced out of work, as a young man with a young family, and being involuntarily on strike for six months or more, consequently making it very hard to provide for his family. The complexity and overprescription that have grown up over the years with regard to the union dominated award system defy belief. They certainly defy logic. There is no justification: it is utterly indefensible to have the system we have at present over six jurisdictions.I have been speaking in the last couple of days about pastoral awards. This is the New South Wales pastoral award, and it goes over 106 pages. But, in fact, those whose ambit it comes within get off lightly, because, when you look at the metal award in New South Wales, that award is 190 pages. There is no justification for this. - This represents big unions and big government, which are embodied by the Labor Party. I have spoken about the cost of some awards in providing for the care of horses supplied by employees and how it varies between states. In some states it is $4, in others it is $3.50 and in some others it is $5.50. It varies, it is inconsistent and it lacks logic. It surprised me to find the same distorted hotchpotch of a system also exists in providing for allowances for bicycles - so much so that, under a number of awards, there is a higher allowance for bicycles than for horses. For instance, under the National Fast Food Retail Award, a bicycle allowance is $9 per week. That is twice the cost of the allowance provided for a horse across the country. With a horse - an essential aid for many in country areas - there are grooming, feed and watering costs. But why would you give twice the amount per week for maintaining a bicycle than you would for maintaining a horse?The Queensland Clerical Employees Award has $3.36 for a bicycle. So caring for a bicycle in Queensland costs about one-third of what it costs in New South Wales. And there is poor old Tassie - the Tasmanian Horticulturalist Award provides only 80c a day for a bicycle. The bicycles must feel neglected! The best of all is the New South Wales shop employees award, because there you get $9.80 for a bicycle - the highest of anywhere in Australia. But better than that: you get $9.80 per week for a tricycle. I do not know how many tricycle enthusiasts there are among the shoppies of New South Wales, but they are well catered for. The simple fact is that these awards - and there are thousands of them - get in the way of commonsense. And it means that not only employers but also employees are spending most of their time trying to adhere to the conditions laid down by the unions and by the Labor Party, so they do not get on with the job. Treat Australians as adults!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston not only for the question but also for his very strong support for the auto industry - not only in South Australia but right around Australia. When it comes to the future of the Australian automotive industry, the government is well and truly taking the driver's seat. This industry has received two long-term plans worth about $7 billion, or even more, from this government. This is a serious investment in the global competitiveness of the Australian automotive industry and it is delivering results. Last year 130,000 Australian made vehicles were exported, and that is a record number. In 2002-03 $630 million was invested in R&amp;D, an increase of $140 million on the R&amp;D in the automotive sector of the previous year. Today, in a positive development for the local automotive industry, Mitsubishi Australia has launched its new 380 model, which has received very strong reviews. I understand that the member for Kingston has already shown his confidence in that product by ordering one. I urge other people to consider that also.There is an oversupply of capacity on a global scale and these are impressive achievements by the Australian industry. We in the government are not resting on our achievements. We are working to ensure that the future of the car industry is as strong as possible. Just recently I led a delegation of industry representatives to Japan and we promoted Australia's automotive capabilities to the head offices of Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan and Mazda. We had a reasonably positive reaction, I have to say. There was one response that we received from them, though, that we all need to bear in mind, and that is that we as an industry in Australia have to deliver on price, quality and, of course, security of supply.It is to the third element that the threats that the member for Kingston has asked about are emerging. Union strikes crippled the car sector in 2001-02, bringing production to a standstill and, at one stage, costing the industry $30 million a day. That is a disgraceful example of reckless union power, and it is no surprise that the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries pointed out on Tuesday in its statement that parts of the Australian automotive supply chain are still particularly vulnerable to disruption. It is no surprise also, on that basis, that the FCAI has fully backed the government's IR reform package. Who opposed it? Doug Cameron opposed it, and so did the federal Labor Party. The federal Labor Party remain the biggest threat to Australia's car industry.</DOC>

 - Not even those who sit behind you were impressed by that little rhetorical flourish. Let me take on face value, for a moment, the allegation made that soft soap is the appearance and that the twisted knife is the reality. Let me go through it. Which is the soft soap - the words of the Australian Labor Party or the reality delivered by the coalition? Let us take wages - a 14.9 per cent increase over 9½ years. Who is delivering - the coalition or the Labor Party? Let us look at interest rates. With the interest rates, people are $500 or $600 a month better off under the coalition than under Labor. Let us look at unemployment. There have been 1.7 million new jobs and we have the lowest unemployment level in 30 years. The soft soap represents the alternative policies of the Labor Party over the last 9½ years.It is now the fourth day that this parliament has sat since the release of this document and the Leader of the Opposition has had four days and four question times to try and build a case against this government, but he has failed again for the same reason that he has failed over the last 9½ years. The Leader of the Opposition's greatest problem is that he does not stand for anything. The Leader of the Opposition's greatest problem is that he will grab hold of any opportunistic argument. He will never go out to the Australian community and argue a consistent proposition. I ask the members of this parliament - stretch back over 9½ years - can you think of one thing that the Leader of Opposition put forward 9½ years ago when he became the leader -  - He says, 'Weak.' That is the thing that you think about, politically speaking, when you hear the Leader of the Opposition. He has had 9½ years to define a persona. He has had 9½ years to tell the Australian people what he stands for. The only thing that can be said of the Leader of the Opposition is that, if the coalition is in favour of it, the Leader of the Opposition is against it.He once believed that you should roll back the GST. He is now so far in retreat from that that when the word 'roll-back' came out of his lips in relation to industrial relations he said: 'No, rub that out; airbrush that out. I didn't really say it.' I thought at one stage the Leader of the Opposition did represent an alternative leader of the Labor movement in this country, but I have watched him over 9½ years. He does not have the ticker to articulate an alternative policy to the Australian people. All he ever does is oppose for opposition's sake.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for raising what is a very important issue. I think the parliament and the nation will be aware of the Volcker report on the United Nations oil for food program, particularly the matters raised in relation to AWB Ltd and two other Australian companies. I am very concerned, as I know many members of this House are, about the findings of the Volcker inquiry. In respect of AWB Ltd, Volcker found that the company had paid the transport company, Alia, over $US221 million for inland transport and that these payments were channelled to the then government of Iraq by Alia. The committee of inquiry noted that this accounted for some 14 per cent of illicit payments made in connection with humanitarian purchases.The government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, providing all information requested by the committee. The Volcker inquiry offered no criticism of the Australian government. When I personally became aware of the Volcker inquiry's interest in AWB Ltd, I asked that the company be encouraged to immediately cooperate fully with the inquiry. It is fair to say that in respect of AWB Ltd, Volcker found:The evidence does not suffice to conclude that AWB had actual knowledge of Alia's partial ownership by the government of Iraq, that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia did not actually perform trucking services for AWB's wheat or that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia remitted the payments it received from AWB to the government of Iraq. On the other hand, it is discussed in detail below numerous documentary and circumstantial warning signs placed at least some employees of AWB on notice that payments to Alia may have been illicitly funding the Iraqi regime.It goes without saying, I hope, that the fact that money coming from AWB Ltd ended up in the pockets of the loathsome Saddam Hussein regime is something that I - and I know many of my colleagues and I am sure many on the other side of the House - find quite unacceptable. I make no judgments beyond the findings of the Volcker inquiry about the conduct of AWB Ltd. My own knowledge and the comments that I have received regarding the people who run that company suggest that they are people of complete integrity. I make no judgments to the contrary. But, given the seriousness of the issue, I believe that there should be an independent inquiry into whether there was any breach of Australian law by those Australian companies referred to in the Volcker report. I believe that that inquiry should be armed with appropriate powers. I have sought advice on what sort of inquiry would be appropriate, and when I have received that advice I will have something further to say on the matter.</DOC>

 - The procedure, as I understand it, was that the contracts were transmitted through the Australian government to the United Nations for approval. That was the nature of the sanctions arrangements. In fact, AWB Ltd - and it should be said in its defence; it is a point that should be borne strongly in mind - relied very heavily on the proposition that because the contracts, including reference to transportation costs, were approved by the United Nations Sanctions Committee it was acting with United Nations authority. Indeed, Paul Volcker in his press conference after the release of his report made the point very clearly and very explicitly that the greatest criticism could be made of the failure of the United Nations itself to properly police the operations of its own resolutions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and his interest. He is a good member who does a good job. Avian flu is an issue that the government is addressing not just in Australia but throughout the region. -  - There seem to be a lot of interjections. You must have put up a candidate against him at the last election who did not win, so let's not forget that. Avian flu has spread, causing more than 60 deaths and leading to the destruction of millions of birds. It obviously has had a very negative effect on many farmers. Thankfully, to date it has not spread between human beings, but we must prepare for this contingency in case an outbreak of that kind does occur. In a worst-case scenario there would be a pandemic.We have taken a lead role in the region in preparing for a possible avian influenza pandemic. We have committed $41 million to the region since 2003 to initiatives to improve detection and response capabilities. Australia has been working within APEC since 2001 to help the region prepare for pandemic threats such as avian flu. Today and tomorrow Australia will continue its regional leadership by hosting a high-level meeting in Brisbane. This will bring together 21 APEC economies, as well as a number of other countries in the South-East Asian region which are not members of APEC and the Pacific Islands Forum. I think this will be a very constructive response which will aim to identify ways in which the APEC economies can better coordinate any regional fight against outbreaks, particularly through better communications between key avian influenza experts in the region and sharing and improving the transparency of information.I understand this is the first time that the principal disaster coordinators from all the APEC economies have come together in one place. Let me just say that, in addition to this regional effort, Australia is investing over $180 million for domestic preparedness and that on 28 October we updated our travel bulletin to strengthen the references on avian influenza. I conclude by saying that we should bear in mind that there is no certainty that avian influenza will become a pandemic. I note that the Australian Medical Association president said today that there is no immediate danger of an avian influenza pandemic and that the WHO official spokeswoman said that 'avian influenza is still not something that we see as a huge risk to the human population'. So we need to bear those things in mind. But, as I have said, I think today's APEC meeting will be a very useful way of helping to coordinate a response from throughout the Asia-Pacific region.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did notice a report in a newspaper on 29 October that correspondence was exchanged between DFAT and the AWB during the second half of 1999 and that Alia was mentioned in this correspondence. That report is in fact misleading. The letter exchanged between the AWB and DFAT was not until October-November 2000, and the exchange of letters was in reference to a general inquiry on the possible use of Jordanian transport companies. The exchange contained no mention whatsoever of Alia or any specific company.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question and I acknowledge the interest that he has in home buyers in his electorate, one of the growth corridors of Melbourne, and how well he represents them. He would be interested to know that the Reserve Bank today released the monthly credit series for September showing that private sector credit increased 0.8 per cent and was 13.3 per cent higher over the year to September. The really interesting thing about these figures, though, is that credit for housing has substantially moderated. It was growing at a rate of around 20 per cent in late 2003 to the beginning of 2004, but it is now growing at a rate of around 13 per cent. It shows that people are not borrowing as much in relation to housing, that the housing market has stabilised somewhat, and we have seen the re-entry of first home buyers into the housing market in greater numbers than there has been for some time.So why is it that credit is pretty stable if credit for housing is moderating? The answer is that we have seen quite a pick-up in credit for business, which around the end of 2003 to the beginning of 2004 was growing at a rate of about eight per cent and is now growing at an annualised rate of about 13 per cent, which is very significant. What that tells us about the state of the Australian economy is that, as the government has been predicting for some time now, the composition of growth in the economy is beginning to change. We have had a welcome moderation in relation to the housing sector and a big pick-up in business investment. Business profitability levels as a proportion of total factor income are now at the highest recorded; that is, the profit share of the economy to total factor income is at the highest recorded. What that tells you is Australian business is profitable, business investment is beginning to pick up and we are laying down good investment for future growth opportunities. This is a welcome rebalancing of the Australian economy, which I believe will be welcomed by first home buyers in particular and especially by businesses as business investment strengthens through the year.</DOC>

 - First of all, let me explain the process, but before I do so let me make this point. The AWB's use of Alia was not specified in the oil for food contracts. The Volcker report noted that the UN was not advised the AWB was making payments to Alia for inland transport costs. As far as the government is aware, the first knowledge of Alia and concerns relating to the AWB's use of the company was in the context of the Volcker inquiry.The second point I would make is that DFAT did not approve oil for food contracts; that was the responsibility of the United Nations. That is made, I would have thought, patently clear in the Volcker report. The United Nations, through the 661 sanctions committee and the UN Secretariat's Office of the Iraq Program, was responsible for all contract approvals. UN customs experts had responsibility to evaluate the price and value of contracts. That is highlighted by the Volcker inquiry. DFAT's role in the process was as follows. Commercial suppliers would negotiate and agree on a contract with their Iraqi counterparts. DFAT was not a party to the contract. - Contracts were forwarded to DFAT only for submission via our UN mission in New York to the UN's Office of the Iraq Program and the 661 sanctions committee. DFAT examined contract paperwork, and once satisfied that this -  - Mr Speaker, the member for Griffith reminds me that the Australian Labor Party took a $500,000 donation from Saddam Hussein's regime in 1975. - For them, having supported Saddam Hussein in recent years, to accuse us of supporting Saddam Hussein, that is really, really rich. That is the richest thing I have heard in this parliament. -  - I would, Mr Speaker, but the interjections are constant -  - and disorderly. - DFAT examined the contract paperwork and, once they were satisfied that this had been properly completed and that the transaction did not appear to infringe the UN sanctions regime the documentation was submitted to the UN in New York. The UN customs experts in the Office of the Iraq Program had responsibility to evaluate the price and the value of contracts and, following the approval of the contracts by the UN, DFAT would issue an export permit authorising the export to Iraq. As I said, just in case honourable members opposite think they can make a political point, AWB's use of Alia was not specified in the oil for food contracts and the Volcker inquiry has made that perfectly clear. It has made it perfectly clear that the government was not in any shape or form involved in any knowledge or participation in a process that led to the funding of Saddam Hussein's regime.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I recognise his interest in increasing competitiveness and productivity in Australia so that we can be more efficient and competitive in the international marketplace. The member for Page would be interested to note that a recent report released by the World Economic Forum shows Australia has climbed from 14th to 10th in the World Economic Forum's 2005 competitiveness ranking. So we have moved up four places in the competitiveness ranking on a global scale in terms of the Australian economy. The report said that Australia moved up four places because of, among other things, its sound public finances - and the government can take significant responsibility for that - and also the innovative nature of its business sector. We know that is correct as well not just of the domestic circumstance but also in the way we engage in business internationally.Unfortunately, Australia only ranked 77th on flexibility on wage determination within our economy by comparison with other countries. It was 77th on that index compared to 10th on the competitiveness ranking. That is another example of why the government's workplace relations reforms are so important. It is so important that we implement these to maintain our competitive edge in the international marketplace. If we are to remain internationally competitive we need to make our workplace relations systems simpler as well as fairer. We also need to make our workplace relations systems fairer and to provide a better balance in the workplace between employee and employer. That is the view of a number of key organisations throughout the economy. It is certainly a view supported by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. The FCAI has said:The ability to implement work practices to support flexible manufacturing systems is crucial to the strengthened competitiveness and ongoing viability of the Australian automotive industry.Of course, we know that is one of our manufacturing industries that has really made significant gains in expanding their export operations, so we should be supporting their view. Our largest exporters of manufactured goods can see the government's workplace relations reforms are in the national interest and in the interests of manufacturing industries in Australia. - The M word - he is awake now; I was waiting for him to hear it. - It is also interesting to note that the member for Lilley recognises this, particularly when he is talking to business groups and the business community. In a speech last week the member for Lilley said:Let me take this opportunity to clear up any misconception on Labor's attitude to proposed industrial relations changes.Labor has an open mind to constructive proposals that will lift productivity ...I say to the member for Lilley that that is exactly the focus that the government has in proposing these workplace relations reforms. I hope that the member for Lilley will stay true to his word, because the FCAI see the government's workplace relations policy as constructive; so do the BCA and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I look forward to the member for Lilley holding the line on this, pursuing greater productivity and increasing competitiveness globally. The first thing to do is to improve the workplace relations system in Australia.</DOC>

 - I have not got final advice on the options in relation to the inquiry, but when I announced it would be a fully independent inquiry I meant precisely that. This government has nothing to hide on this issue - nothing to hide at all. I can only say that. We will see what time and investigation reveal. I make this point to the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that, in an inquiry established by the United Nations to report on the oil for food program and the involvement of countries and companies in that oil for food program, having received in the case of Australia full responses and cooperation and full documentation, if there were anything lacking in the behaviour of Australia in relation to her obligations the Volcker inquiry would have so reported.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question and I can inform him that there has been substantive support for the government's proposed industrial relations changes from the International Monetary Fund, which in its report on Australia in September 2005 said about the government's package of reforms:The mission urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements.There we have the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, probably the premier world economic body, urging the introduction of the government's industrial relations changes. This report from the IMF did not find favour with the ACTU, Mr Speaker, I regret to inform you. The ACTU wrote back to the IMF accusing it of a 'deplorable intervention in a controversial domestic policy debate'. Sharan Burrow, writing on 12 September 2005, said the IMF in its report was 'selective, tendentious and shallow' and that the report was 'reflecting poorly on the professionalism, independence and expertise of the IMF review team'. Not only did she write back with an abusive letter to the IMF but she hotfooted it over to Washington to tell the IMF that it was wrong and that the ACTU was right.On a question of economic policy, I wonder who would have more credibility: the IMF or the ACTU. A tough call. Anyway, the IMF has now published its reply of 27 October 2005 to Ms Burrow's complaints on its web site. The IMF notes:... this improvement in flexibility, supported by increased competition ... and other structural reforms, has been an important contributor to Australia's excellent record of job creation and productivity growth during the past 14 years ...... the proposed industrial relations reforms as further steps in the same direction, which will improve the functioning of the labor market and help sustain Australia's strong economic performance in future ...... the benefits of economic reforms in Australia, including improvements in the functioning of the labor market, have been substantial, and this gives a sound basis for expecting positive results from further labor market reforms.And then it politely says to Ms Burrow:Hence, I can not accept the statement in your letter ...The IMF, probably the premier economic decision-making body of the world, has looked at Australia's industrial relations proposed changes and it has endorsed them. It has been attacked for doing so by the ACTU. It has given the ACTU a fair hearing and it has rejected in its entirety the claims of the ACTU.Periodically we hear the claim from the Labor Party that they are going to stand for economic responsibility - 'In the future we are going to stand for economic responsibility; we may not have in the past but in the future we are going to change our ways' - and they charge Australian business lots of money to tell them how they are going to change their ways. The only problem is that every time it comes to a concrete, practical reform this party, which deep down want you to think that they believe in economic reform, never quite get around to supporting it - never quite make it. Industrial relations - never quite make it. Welfare to work - never quite make it. The government cuts taxes in the budget; the Labor Party vote against them. Don't think they are against tax cuts. No, they only vote against them. The reality is that, if the Australian Labor Party want to get back into business, if they want to have a skerrick of economic responsibility, if they want to show that they are now a post-Latham party, the Australian Labor Party will support the biggest micro-economic reform that we could possibly do in this country: reform of Australia's industrial relations system.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Adelaide, without checking I am not aware of the provisions of the South Australian award. Let me say in relation to leave loadings and penalty rates generally that, if someone is on an award under the new system, that person will get the payments in relation to those matters that are prescribed by the award in relation to agreements. There will be a fair pay and conditions standard, which has already been explained in great detail, and in the absence of explicit provision to the contrary there is a default provision in the new policy which will guarantee delivery of the award provisions in relation to penalty rates and loadings.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. The reality is that a modern industrial relations system will be of great benefit to Australia's workplaces and the employers and employees of Australia. Indeed, this is something which various members of the union movement and the Labor Party have recognised on occasions. As far back as 1990 the later-to-be Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, supported a national workplace relations system, saying that 'six different systems was an absurd luxury'. Just last week the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, endorsed the need to rationalise the number of awards, saying:We're not as a matter of principle opposed to the idea of rationalising the number of awards and doing it in an orderly way.And, indeed, the opposition spokesman, the member for Perth, has said:If we were to start again as a nation with a clean slate, and recognise that we now have a national and an international economy, then you could certainly look at creating a single national system for industrial relations.These are statements of support for measures that the government intends to introduce in relation to the workplace relations system in Australia. They stand in stark contrast to some of the hysterical statements we have heard from other union officials and leaders over the last few weeks - for example, we have had Brian Boyd from the Victorian Trades Hall Council saying that this is going to enslave workplaces in Australia, and Andy Gillespie from the South Coast Labour Council predicts a real breakdown in society. John Robertson from Unions New South Wales says that this is an attack on the way in which our children are going to be raised. Janet Giles from Unions SA - listen to this - says that more workers would die of asbestosis related diseases, because of the changes in the industrial relations system. I suppose that happened in the UK when it was changed there! But it gets worse. We have Bob Smith in the Victorian parliament saying that in America women and children were killed and this is the road that the Prime Minister wants to take us down. What hysterical nonsense from Bob Smith! On top of that we have Workers Online, the official organ of LaborNET, reporting: 'The federal government's changes to industrial relations could kill people.' What hysterical nonsense we are hearing from the Labor Party and union leaders about this!No wonder we are getting this hysterical response, when we had on Lateline on 10 August the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions - the senior official of the union movement in Australia - saying, in support of the campaign that the unions are running: 'I need a mum or dad of someone who has been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.' No wonder we are getting these hysterical statements from union leaders around Australia when they have been given a lead by Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, saying, 'It would be fantastic for our campaign to get hold of the mum or dad of someone who has been killed in Australia.' That is a totally abysmal comment coming from the labour movement.Have we heard a word about this from the Leader of the Opposition? Have we heard one word, one phrase or one sentence of condemnation from the Leader of the Opposition on this? Not a word. The reason is that he is a captive of the union bosses in Australia. When it comes to policy in Australia the Leader of the Opposition is a policy free zone. He is a passenger when it comes to reform. He is sitting in the passenger seat doing, once again, what others tell him to do.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to the member for Adelaide, I have not seen that AWA and I am not going to comment on it and I am not aware, without reference, of the provisions of the South Australian award. But the situation is as outlined in the government's publicity and is as I have previously said: if somebody continues under an award - and that will be the case for very large numbers of workers - then the terms and provisions of that award are in fact maintained by law. So much so that I take an example of somebody who is employed under the nurses award in Victoria. Under that award provision there is an even more generous allotment for long service leave than is specified in the Victorian legislation. That more generous allotment of long service leave will continue for not only current but also future employees who are employed under the award. That is exactly the sort of protection that we had in mind when we spoke of it, and I thank the member for Perth for raising the issue. - Quite clearly, if a person is under an award then the provisions of the award will continue. - If a person is negotiating an agreement then the fair pay and conditions standard will apply, and penalty rates and so forth will, as we have indicated, be matters of negotiation. But, in the absence of specific provisions, the provisions in the award will apply by default.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I can say that he contacted me over the weekend about this issue and I know that he and many of his constituents are deeply concerned about this. Indeed, on 26 October, at an anti-Zionist conference - as it was described - in Tehran, the Iranian President openly called for the state of Israel to be 'wiped off the map'. This call from the leader of a significant nation state is one of the most appalling, dangerous and unacceptable views that we have heard for a very long time. Such extremist views are totally unacceptable. They do nothing to reassure the international community that Iran is prepared to be a responsible international citizen. This appalling outburst - especially at this time - is particularly troubling given Iran's apparent nuclear ambitions.On Friday I called the Iranian ambassador to register Australia's strong condemnation of these remarks, and my department at a senior level did the same thing, calling in the ambassador. Our embassy in Tehran is also making representations to the Iranian government along these lines. Some saner heads in Tehran have been trying to see a walk back from the President's position. The foreign ministry issued a statement saying that Iran has never threatened use of force against any country - but Iran, and especially its President, its head of state, needs to understand that the world will take it at its word and will not tolerate threats of this kind to international peace and security.Australia has been a long-term and strong supporter of Israel. Israel is a nation-state which is constantly under threat and has constantly had to resort to a fight for its very existence. To many Israelis, and to Jews around the world, the Iranian President's comments confirm what they felt they knew about Iran's intent. For the rest of the world his comments have merely demonstrated the desire of his government to be a constant threat, in one way or another, to the state of Israel. We will continue to support the state of Israel and continue to fight against these extreme views that should not be tolerated at all in this day and age. We are united and unequivocal in our fight against anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it is encountered.</DOC>

 - May I compliment the member for Indi and others on this side of the House for their strong interest in upgrading Australia's rail network and the importance of improving our capacity to deal with the growing freight task. The member for Indi and I both welcomed the announcement on Friday by the ARTC that it will invest $560 million to upgrade the rail line between Sydney and Melbourne. The ARTC is the Australian government-owned company that has the responsibility for implementing the government's investment in rail infrastructure.This announcement is a part of $1.4 billion to be spent on the Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane rail corridor to meet some of the anticipated doubling of the freight task on that route over the next 10 years, so it is a critical infrastructure development. This particular investment will provide over 220 kilometres of new passing loops, an extensive upgrading of the railway signalling system, more than 290,000 additional concrete sleepers, the construction of a direct standard gauge connection between the north-south and east-west corridors at Brooklyn in Melbourne, and also a significant upgrading of the overall management and operation of that system.The pleasing news is that this investment will take about 2½ hours off the time taken for a freight train to do the journey between Sydney and Melbourne. That is a significant advance in making rail more competitive. With continuing investment we can do even better than that. It is vitally important that we have a strong and competitive rail system, particularly after the years of neglect by Labor. They simply did nothing for the rail system in their years in office. They left us not just with the infamous rail gauge state barriers but with 22 different safe working systems and 18 different train communication systems. So we have had these barriers to prevent the train system from operating smoothly and efficiently. We cannot afford to featherbed that system anymore. It has a vital task to perform in ensuring that Australia can move its freight and exports around the nation efficiently. This investment will help achieve some of those objectives and help make trains move more efficiently around the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for his question. Can I make a couple of points. Firstly, ministers make decisions, not public servants. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is that there was no -  - No, it was not. It was an election commitment. It was during an election. Remember the election? I know you would like to forget it - although I think you would have done better, Simon. Brian Loughnane was right about that. - Yes, a much better shadow Treasurer. This was a $50,000 commitment, of an overall amount of $105,000, contributed to by the Commonwealth government and local interests, including the local council, and there was a small contribution from BlueScope Steel. It was a $105,000 commitment to enhance the business centre of a small township called Newman. Newman - if anybody knows anything about Western Australia and the export industries of this nation - has made a massive contribution to the export capacity of Western Australia and, quite frankly, I am very pleased to defend the decision. It was a decision that we made to commit to that. It has been implemented. The money was allocated in the budget. As always, an agreement has been entered into between the department and the recipient regarding the terms and conditions of disbursing the amount.I might also point out that, according to my reading of the letter of 16 September, it did not amount to what the member for Hotham suggested. It did not declare it dead in the water; it in fact requested further information and indicated that, if that information were not provided, the application could not proceed. But let me just go back to the point I made right at the beginning: with no disrespect to public servants who give advice, in the end, as you will remember from your days in government - and I address through you, Mr Speaker, the member for Hotham - decisions are taken by ministers. A decision was taken by me to support this program, just as I took a decision during the election campaign to provide two much larger amounts of money, in relation to which there has not been a zephyr of criticism from those who sit opposite. I think of Whitten Oval in the member for Gellibrand's seat - no criticism of that. That was a decision -  - He wanted it for Windy Hill. I do not recall - and there ought not to have been either - any criticism from the member for Barton on the allocation of the money for the upgrade of Kogarah Oval. The reality is that governments take decisions and they must be judged by those decisions. They cannot hide behind public servants. I have not sought to do so. I defend the decision and I make no apologies for it.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass very much for his question. I congratulate him on his support for the Work for the Dole program. He has been a wonderful member in such a short period of time for Bass. It is a refreshing start for Bass to have somebody who is working hard. The member for Bass is of course very proud of the coalition's improvements in unemployment in Bass, because unemployment has dropped from 9.9 per cent under Labor to 5.6 per cent under this government today.Recently I attended the electorate of the member for Bass to visit the award-winning Mount Barrow Work for the Dole project, which received the Prime Minister's award for the best Work for the Dole activity last year. It was a wonderful activity. I congratulate the local member for his support. He knows, as we on this side of the House do, that since 1997 there have been about 422,000 people who have participated in a wonderful program. It has provided people with the work experience and with the opportunity to help themselves into work, to gain experience in a team-like environment, and we know that this government stands committed to the Work for the Dole program.I am asked for any other views, and of course the views of the Labor Party on Work for the Dole are well known. We know that the Labor Party hate Work for the Dole. We know that, since the program came in in 1997, on about 336 occasions members opposite have taken the opportunity to attack Work for the Dole. But there are, we know, two silent supporters of Work for the Dole on the other side. We need to highlight them again today, because they deserve recognition. I want to recognise today the member for Shortland. She has had something very quiet, but positive nonetheless, to say about Work for the Dole. And there is our old friend the member for Franklin. It is probably no coincidence that they are seated beside each other, because I know they talk regularly about Work for the Dole. They support it. It is a great program. The Leader of the Opposition should listen to their sound counsel, follow the lead of the government and support Work for the Dole.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I applaud his very strong support for small business. I can advise the member for Bonner and all members here that in fact small business has many difficulties to contend with because it must navigate its way through 130 different pieces of legislation, 4,000 awards and six different workplace systems right across the country. That means that small business has to contend with spending a lot more time than it needs to and a lot more money than it needs to and, importantly, that means a loss of jobs. Let me refer members to one award included in that maze: the Traffic Operating, Workshops and Miscellaneous Grades Award. It states, 'Suitable watches provided for use in connection with the performance of duties shall be supplied and kept in repair.' I have to tell you that I have heard of workers getting a watch on retirement, but this must be the only job where the boss must give you a watch on your first day on the job and then make sure that it is repaired during your life of employment in that job.The government's workplace relations reforms will ensure that small business does not have to contend with that maze of awards. The government's workplace relations reforms will ensure that it will be easier and simpler for small business and it will be much more flexible. It means that small business will have the time to get on with doing the job that it is meant to be doing: doing business and growing its business. It will actually be able to employ more people. Red tape will be reduced, duplication will be avoided, and all of this will be of direct benefit to small business.I am asked whether there are any alternatives. I have to say to that, sadly, there are not. The Labor opposition has no appetite for reform; it has no energy and no commitment to reform. Let me refer the House to the recent so-called Labor Business Forum, where the Leader of the Opposition could not even bring himself to mention small business. Small business in this country knows that it is only this government that understands the needs of small business and it is only this government that is committed to reforming workplace relations for small business.</DOC>

 - The campaign that the Leader of the Opposition referred to concluded last weekend. I am informed by my department that the costs of the campaign are as follows: $38.3 million is expected to be spent on advertising, research, creative agency costs and public affairs, and $2.7 million is expected to be spent on booklets and distribution costs. The total cost of advertising and associated printing and distribution is thus approximately $41 million. In addition, it is expected to cost $4.7 million for a call centre which continues to provide information to the community. These costs are substantially less than the $100 million figure asserted by the Leader of the Opposition - $100 million, he said! - and less than the approved amount of $55 million, an amount always understood to be a contingency figure. The Leader of the Opposition is wrong. I have not misled the public.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question and for his very strong support for democracy all around the world, including in the Middle East. He is a real champion of democracy. -  - I thought that might make you interject because we know that the Labor Party has not stood up much for democracy in the Middle East. So come in spinner, over there! The referendum that was held in Iraq on 15 October was another very great success for democracy in Iraq. We had elections on 30 January for the transitional assembly and we had the referendum on 15 October. What is interesting about this is that nearly 10 million Iraqis voted and, interestingly enough, the overwhelming majority of them - I think it was about 78 per cent - supported ratification of the constitution. So that is the situation in a country which has never known democracy. Since 1922, when it was established by the British, it has never known democracy. Finally, admittedly during very troubled times, 10 million of those brave people of Iraq, in the teeth of threats from insurgents and terrorists, went out and voted and endorsed a democratic constitution for their country.I want to make it clear that on this side of the House we support those 10 million people and we will not walk away from them. The last thing we would want to see - and I would have thought the last thing anyone would want to see - would be the democracy that has been embraced by millions and millions of Iraqis taken away from them and trashed, and the country handed over to the Saddam Hussein supporting insurgents and the al-Qaeda, al-Zawahari terrorists. That is the last thing on earth you would ever want. At least on this side of the House we never wanted Saddam Hussein in the first place and we helped get rid of him. We do not want the terrorists to win in Iraq either. It is as simple and it is as clear as that.</DOC>

 - As I explained in the answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the figure of the expenditure to date is not $55 million; it is in the order of $45.7 million. But let me say this: it has long been the custom of governments on both sides of this parliament to run public information campaigns in relation to important changes. There is nothing partisan in any of this advertising in the sense that it is critical of the Australian Labor Party or critical of the trade union movement. You will find nothing in that advertising which offers any kind of partisan political comment against the Australian Labor Party. I would also remind those who sit opposite that there were court proceedings taken by the member for Gellibrand on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and also the trade union movement, and those court proceedings failed, with costs awarded against the applicant.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and acknowledge her support of the exporting industries in her electorate that continue to generate more jobs and better paid jobs: organisations like SunRice and some of the outstanding performers in the wine export industry from the Riverina, like yellow tail - the Casella family wine brand - and the De Bortoli wine brand. Interestingly, there are also some manufacturing industries in the member for Riverina's electorate: Celair-Malmet and Precision Parts - both manufacturing companies, both domiciled in the regional electorate of the member for Riverina and both exporting into the United States.The government's trade policy agenda has focused on opening up opportunities across the world with bilateral negotiations, regional negotiations and global negotiations. To take advantage of those outcomes that we have achieved, we put in place a number of programs to assist and enable those businesses to take advantage of or capitalise on the market opportunities we have opened up - programs like the New Exporter Development Program, which takes aspiring exporters from the initial inquiry stage into the marketplace, and programs like TradeStart, where we have set up a national network of 50 offices that provide resources, advice and guidance for new exporters getting into export markets across the world. Of course, there is also the $160 million a year Export Market Development Grants Scheme that assists businesses in marketing their products in markets across the world. - The member for Melbourne was not awake. I named two manufacturing industries in the member for Riverina's electorate that are benefiting from the government's programs. All along, this government has kept the economy strong and maintained that as a base off which Australian exporters can compete in the marketplace. In the tax reform that we put through a number of years ago, we removed billions of dollars worth of taxes from the backs of Australian exporters and the products that they were competing with overseas, which significantly improved their competitiveness. Now we are proposing workplace reforms, which we are putting to the Australian people, that will again improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australia's industries and exporting industries.The government's position is backed up by many of the industry organisations. Thirty-seven of the ACCI member organisations, comprising 350,000 Australian businesses and employing about four million Australian employees, have passed a resolution unanimously supporting the government's reforms. It is right across the business community, and it is coming from regional Australia as well. I point to the example of a press release that has been put out by Commerce Queensland's south-west regional council. I will give them the last word on the issue of reform and what is needed to maintain their productive and competitive edge. Commerce Queensland's press release, in talking about the south-west region, says, 'Implementing the Work Choices package will benefit the south-west region through higher productivity, more job opportunities and scope for more productive and secure work which generates higher living standards' - that is, higher living standards for their employees and the work force across Australia.</DOC>

 - The skilled migration program that the Howard government has put in place has been one of the greatest economic fillips that the country has had. It has had a lot to do with the fact that Australia is now in such a sound economic position. The measures recently introduced by Minister Vanstone, particularly those relating to apprenticeships and skilled migration, will mean that positions cannot be filled by an employer unless they are unable to fill them locally. This government will continue its skilled program. It has been an enormous success for Australia. In terms of people being turned away from TAFE, I think that the opposition - and in particular the member for Watson - should ask their state colleagues why they have lifted the fees at all the TAFE colleges.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform him that yesterday Brad Cooper, a former chairman of FAI Home Security, was found guilty in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on six charges under the Crimes Act of corruptly giving a cash benefit to influence an agent of HIH. He was found guilty on seven charges under the Crimes Act of publishing false or misleading statements with an intent to obtain financial advantage. He was remanded in custody and will appear for sentencing on 2 December.In addition to that, Terry Cassidy, a former managing director of HIH, was sentenced earlier this year to 15 months imprisonment in relation to three criminal charges. Also earlier this year, Ray Williams, formerly the chief executive officer, was sentenced to 4½ years in jail, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months. Earlier this year, Rodney Adler was sentenced to 4½ years in jail, with a non-parole period of 2½ years. William Howard was sentenced to three years imprisonment, fully suspended on the basis of his ongoing assistance to the HIH investigation. In addition, ASIC continues to pursue those who are alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct, and charges are outstanding against some other people who have already been presented and charged.The HIH collapse was Australia's largest corporate collapse. Funding for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has increased 63 per cent over the past five years, and I think both sides of the House would recognise that the investigation in relation to HIH has been very speedy and very successful. Over the last five years, 128 people in total have been jailed on charges brought by ASIC for terms totalling over 430 years. That will give the House some indication of the enforcement capacity that ASIC now has and the resources that it has at its disposal. It should send a very clear message to any person who is engaged in a breach of the Corporations Act that these matters can and will be investigated, charges will be brought and the chances of securing a conviction are very high.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. It is an enormously serious issue and one which preoccupies members of the government, as well as the member for Kennedy and industries at large. So I do not in any sense, despite the length of the question, doubt the member's sincerity and the seriousness of the issue. There are a number of issues here. I think the member is likely to be guilty of selective judgment on each of them. Briefly, with regard to the Brazilian issue, there was no risk. The importation certificate was given, according to an agreed policy with industry. It was a good wake-up call. We have changed the situation with industry. We will not accept zonal clearances without a visit by Australian quarantine officials themselves.With regard to bananas, the member would have us have a 'no risk' policy. The fact is we have to have a very low risk policy; otherwise, you would not import genetics, embryos or semen or allow in overseas visitors. Regarding pork, I cannot agree with the honourable member's reading of the court judgment. In actual fact, the outcome of the full Federal Court in that particular case confirmed the legality of the import risk assessment processes and it reinstated the operation of that generic pig meat import risk assessment.In summary, the government has committed Australia to a rigorous science based approach to quarantine, protecting our borders from highly feral pests, and our disease status remains undiminished. I will always have a dialogue with the honourable member or industries to strengthen our border protection with regard to quarantine and biosecurity. We are ever alert to the possibility of imported pests or disease. It is a difficult area to get across to people because of the trade implications and the fact that everything has to be done on a science basis only.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his support for the government's proposed changes to the workplace relations system. Under the Work Choices system which the government proposes to introduce to this parliament tomorrow, all workers on agreements will be guaranteed four weeks annual leave. They will be guaranteed 10 days of personal or carers leave and 52 weeks of parental leave. This is important because this is the first time within the federal system that these statutory protections will be provided to all workers. What this involves are changes that combine both flexibility and fairness. These are reforms which are essential to the health of our economy. This is something which some members opposite understand and also recognise. Indeed on 19 October the member for Perth told Mike Jeffries on Radio 2CC:I've got no difficulty with having some flexibility in the workplace of people who want to work part-time or casual or want to work part-time hours or different hours; there is no difficulty with providing that flexibility. And in very many respects, to remain internationally competitive, in some industries and some areas we need to do that ...The difference between the government and the opposition is that we on this side of the House are actually prepared to act to do something about it. All the ALP and the union movement will do is run a misleading scare campaign.We saw another example of this yesterday at question time. The member for Adelaide - prompted, no doubt, by the member for Perth - claimed that employees at the Blue Galah Backpackers Hostel in Adelaide were being ripped off on AWAs which traded off annual leave, leave loading and other conditions. What the member for Adelaide failed to point out to the House yesterday was that the Australian workplace agreements in question paid the employees at a rate of $16.27 per hour averaged over the two-year life of the agreement -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition says 'Oh, heavens!' but the employee was paid $16.27 an hour. - Let me remind the House that -  - the relevant award's ordinary hourly rate for a receptionist in this position was just $13.43. -  - So this is an own goal, mate - you know it. An own goal. - What the member for Perth failed to disclose to the House yesterday was that, under this Australian workplace agreement, an employee in question was paid $2.84 an hour extra. That means for an employee in this position, working an ordinary 38-hour week, that is $107.92 per week or some $5,000 a year extra. We did not hear that from the member for Adelaide yesterday. I understand this was the first question that the member for Adelaide has been allowed to ask by the other side. Is this the way that she purports to represent the small businesses in her electorate, through her questions?The reality is that many of the employees in this business are casual workers. What this actually provides is an agreement that allows a person to have a two-year contract, that gives them permanent employment and, not only that, provides them over that two-year period with an extra $10,000. We did not hear anything about that yesterday from the member for Adelaide. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition is flip-flopping on the issue of AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition has said, rightly, that he could not abolish AWAs now because there would be too many losers. This was an example of one of the losers if the ALP's policy to abolish Australian workplace agreements was ever implemented.</DOC>

 - Could I make the observation that maybe this is the question the Leader of the Opposition might have first asked yesterday. Be that as it may, let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that there was nothing sanctioned by this government - nothing at all. So many of the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition are based on falsehoods. It is a falsehood for the Leader of the Opposition -  - to assert that these were government sanctioned payments. So far as the inquiry is concerned, on the first available opportunity after the House met, in answer to the very first question from my side, I indicated the government's concern about aspects of this report. I said that we would have a proper independent inquiry. I am taking advice on the form of that inquiry. When I have got that advice, which I expect to be later this week, I will make an announcement. I am sure that the announcement I make will provide for a full independent inquiry to get to the bottom of this, with proper powers of investigation. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I want to make it very clear that Australia is not alone in the fight on terrorism. All countries are meeting the same challenges that we are facing at this time. They recognise that the threat of terrorism is very real. We know that Australia and Australian interests have been targeted at least once every year in the past five years both here and abroad. The Director-General of ASIO informed a Senate estimates hearing last night that al-Qaeda and like-minded organisations have shown an intent to conduct attacks in Australia. An attack here is feasible and could well occur.Last week I had the opportunity to meet with security chiefs in France, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain. The underlying theme in all of the discussions in which I was engaged was how we could stop terrorists before they carry out their evil deeds. The London bombings, of course, highlighted the increasingly complex and difficult nature of modern terrorism investigations. They transcend international policing boundaries, they involve the need to establish identity, they involve intensive forensic work and access to data using new technologies, they often require investigations where you are dealing with many different languages and, as we saw in London, they can involve reviewing thousands of hours of CCTV footage. As the Deputy Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Service told me, it is a very different ball game now. That is why in all of these countries there has been a renewed focus on preventative measures.In the United Kingdom suspects can be held in preventative detention for 14 days, and the UK is looking to extend that to 90 days because of the sorts of factors I have mentioned. In Spain they can hold people incommunicado for 13 days but for up to four years in pre-trial detention if required. In France, we know that terrorist suspect Willie Brigitte has been held without charge for two years with a maximum of three years available. It is in that context, when people look at what is being proposed here in Australia as against what is happening abroad in countries that are democratic and do accept the rule of law, that they have given their agencies, as I believe we should give our agencies, an opportunity to deal with consequences but also to stop terrorists before they strike. The measures that we are proposing are constrained with appropriate safeguards and are commensurate with the very significant level of threat that we face.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no, he did not. In elaboration, I further say to the honourable gentleman that, if we just examine it for a moment, the proposition is that in some way the government sanctioned the payment of amounts of money to Saddam Hussein. - I would remind the House that the Volcker inquiry was presided over -  - by somebody who is held in very high regard by both sides of politics in the United States and who many people argue is one of the most successful and esteemed chairmen of the American federal reserve system. The Volcker inquiry had access at all times to any documents within the possession of the Australian government that it wanted. I gave instructions and the foreign affairs minister gave instructions that any documents that the Volcker inquiry wanted - any cooperation that the Volcker inquiry wanted - it would have them. When I heard of the possible interest of the Volcker inquiry in the activities of AWB Ltd, I asked the now Deputy Prime Minister to write to AWB Ltd making a claim to the company that it should cooperate in full with the Volcker inquiry.Any questions we were asked as a government by the Volcker inquiry we answered. It is interesting, isn't it, as a commentary on what the Leader of the Opposition is now asserting, that after all its investigations and in the face of all of that cooperation the Volcker inquiry offered not a word of criticism of the Australian government. Not a word of criticism was offered. Further to that, as a result both of the Volcker inquiry and also -  - I will tell you why. We are having the inquiry because we have been asked to do so by the United Nations. I do not normally like the interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because they are hard to follow, but on this occasion I am delighted to inform her that one of the reasons we are having the inquiry is that we were asked to do so by the United Nations. When the Volcker report was brought down, Kofi Annan asked all member countries to make sure that they investigated whether there had been any breaches of domestic law by the companies that had been named - and that is exactly what the Australian government is doing. I say to the member for Griffith that this will be a full inquiry. I was interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about an unimpeachable judge, the implication being that some of the judges serving in Australia are impeachable, which I find rather contemptible. One of the things this government is proud of is that we have an incorruptible judiciary. We will have a good inquiry, and any questions that are asked of the government by that inquiry will be fully answered.</DOC>

 - I thought the maiden question was excellent. Firstly, Australia will be very proud to host the first meeting of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. It will be held in Australia in the middle of January. The partnership countries - Australia, the United States, China, India, Japan and Korea - represent about 50 per cent of the world's energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This first meeting, we expect, will lay out a framework for cooperation involving governments, of course, but also industry and the scientific community. We will also look at ways to meet our energy, climate change and air pollution challenges in ways that promote jobs and, more broadly, economic growth.We do not want to undercut or try to circumvent Kyoto; we just want to make the point that Kyoto will not address the problem of climate change, I am afraid, and that we may as well all face up to that. Without Kyoto, by 2010 emissions will have grown by 41 per cent from 1990. With Kyoto, assuming that all of the countries that signed up to Kyoto meet their targets - which clearly they will not - emissions will increase by 40 per cent. So it is completely misleading to suggest that Kyoto is going to solve the problem of climate change. Let me quote a great Labour leader. I refer, of course, not to the Leader of the Opposition but to Tony Blair, the Leader of the British Labour Party. Speaking about Kyoto in the Observer newspaper at the weekend, he said that, in the current climate change debate, there is 'a reluctance to face up to reality and the practical action needed to tackle the problems'. He said that Kyoto is 'not enough':We need to cut greenhouse gas emissions radically but Kyoto doesn't even stabilise them.This leader of the British Labour Party is a man of principle, rather than what we are left with in this country - a rank opportunist. Tony Blair made the point that there is a need for 'major developed and emerging nations to sit down together and work it out in a way that allows us all to grow, imposes no competitive disadvantage' - which is one of the things, by the way, that Kyoto would have done for us - 'and enables the transfer of technology needed for sustainable growth to take place'. In other words, Tony Blair proposes that we do exactly what we are doing with the Asia-Pacific partnership. It is such a shame that the Labor Party in this country is today reduced to a bunch of vacuous opportunists. - It is such a shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and acknowledge what a great supporter of the resources sector he is. The year 2004-05 was by any measure outstanding for the resources sector, with some $67 billion worth of exports - and things are going to get better for the resources sector. ABARE predict that exports will rise in the current year to $87 billion. There are real opportunities for growth in the resources sector. Around the world demand for uranium is surging with an estimated 25 nuclear power plants under construction and a further 74 planned. More than 40 per cent of the world's reserves are in Australia. Australia is uniquely placed to meet demand. Of course, we only meet that demand in accordance with the strictest environmental, Indigenous and non-proliferation safeguards.I am asked by the member for Solomon about threats to export opportunities and, as usual, they come from those opposite. When it comes to expanding Australia's uranium industry, the Labor Party are hopelessly divided. The South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, says that Labor's three-mine policy has anomalies - I think that is because there are actually four uranium mines in Australia - and that it should be reviewed. Kevin Foley was a bit blunter than that and said that the policy was idiotic. Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, categorically rules out uranium mining in his state. The federal opposition leader says that the three-mine policy stands. Even though there are already four mines, he says that the three stand. The member for Batman has an enlightened opinion on this. He says that the three-mine policy does not even exist. The Labor Party policy is a joke. It has a confused ideological stance, which is costing Australia jobs, exports and economic growth.Sitting suspended from 2.47 pm to 3.30 pm</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and acknowledge his abiding interest in ensuring that the building industry - not only in his electorate of La Trobe but right throughout Australia - operates in a lawful manner. I can inform him and the House that the Australian Building and Construction Commission commenced its operations on 1 October, and last week the government announced the appointment of Mr Ross Dalgleish as the second deputy commissioner of the new commission. Mr Dalgleish has enormous experience in building industry regulation, having been a member of the New South Wales building task force in the 1990s - that was until it was abolished overnight by the Carr government, when it came to power in 1995, at the behest of the building unions.It is important to talk about the building and construction industry today because the building and construction industry is one of the worst examples of the failures of the current workplace relations system. - It is a good illustration of why it is important that there be further reforms to the workplace relations system in Australia. The building and construction industry is notorious for its unlawful conduct. Indeed, in 2001 -  - In 2001 the National Secretary of the CFMEU, John Sutton, conceded - The member for Rankin then left the chamber. - I was telling the House that in 2001 the National Secretary of the CFMEU, Mr John Sutton, conceded:There has been some organised crime elements that have been making a bit of a push on the industry and the union over the last, say, six to nine months.This culture of corruption and lawlessness, which Mr Sutton conceded in 2001, was the reason -  -  - This lawlessness, this corruption and these illegal activities, which Mr Sutton conceded in 2001, were the reason why this government established the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. This is what Mr Justice Cole said in his royal commission report about the state of Western Australia -  - the state from which the Leader of the Opposition comes. He said that the building and construction industry in Western Australia is:... marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. - He went on:Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously. At the centre of this culture and much of the unlawful and inappropriate conduct is the CFMEU.That is what Mr Justice Cole found. Yet what response did we have from the opposition to the report of Justice Cole from the royal commission? The reality is that the Australian Labor Party opposed tooth and nail every recommendation or reform that the Cole royal commission recommended to this parliament, including the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. What is their attitude to the royal commission findings and, in particular, the unlawful and corrupt conduct of the CFMEU? - This is what the Leader of the Opposition condones - The member for Charlton then left the chamber. - It is this corrupt, illegal and lawless behaviour of the CFMEU that the Leader of the Opposition condones. This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in an interview with Tim Cox:... the CFMEU is an affiliated organisation of the Labor Party, in good odour in the Labor Party.That is what the Leader of the Opposition condones. No wonder this is a union which has put the interests of the union bosses ahead of the interests of the workers of Australia -  -  - They do not like this, Mr Speaker. -  - This is a union that is doing the bidding of the Leader of the Opposition and the reason why is that the CFMEU has donated $4.9 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1996. This government will act in the best interests of Australian workers. We will not simply kowtow to corrupt union bosses.</DOC>

 - The changes introduced this morning by my colleague the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations included a series of measures that are big changes to Australia's industrial relations system. They are very fair changes and, so far from crushing the living standards, they will continue to enhance the living standards of Australian workers.The member for Fowler then left the chamber. - What really aggravates the opposition is not this legislation.

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I can inform her that Australia will experience enormous economic benefit from changes to workplace relations. Not only will that lead to a more effective -  -  - Not only will workplace relations changes lead to a more productive Australian economy but they will give more Australians the chance of a job. That is what improvements in industrial relations are all about.The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - Mr Speaker - The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - if you wanted some economic authority for that, the IMF in its article IV report on Australia of November 2004 said:The government agenda of proposed amendments to the Workplace Relations Act continues to simplify procedures, increase labor market flexibility, and link wages and work conditions to productivity.The IMF went on to say:... the wage bargaining system needs further simplification, including a reduction in the overlap of the federal and state award systems ...There you have the International Monetary Fund, probably the world's premier economic body, say that further wage deregulation in Australia - more flexibility - will be good for the Australian economy.Who is opposing these industrial relations changes? For some reason I was sent a copy of the SDA news bulletin. The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees are urging a rally on 15 November. Their bulletin says:The ACTU is holding rallies across Australia on November 15 to oppose the legislation. I ask all delegates and health and safety representatives to attend.Listen to this:We will reimburse loss of wages for delegates and representatives for the half-day. -  -  - So we have the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees union paying its delegates to go to demonstrations - so outraged! All of this rather takes me back to why the Leader of the Opposition would be opposing these changes. On the one hand, he says he wants to focus on the economy, he wants to re-establish relationships with the business community and he charged $5,000 for business delegates last week to come and hear him tell them how he is going to get used to economic reform. There is only one thing the Leader of the Opposition can never do: he can never actually bring himself to vote for an economic reform. - I am coming to the alternative views. The alternative views come from the Leader of the Opposition, who has opposed every decent, worthwhile economic reform in the last 10 years, who opposed balancing the budget, who opposed reducing debt, who opposed monetary policy, who opposes industrial relations -  - The Australian Labor Party is opposing workplace relations reforms for the same reason that it opposed the reform of the taxation system, the balancing of the budget, monetary policy, the repayment of debt: Labor stands against economic reform, and Labor stands against opportunity for Australians.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. The reality is that the living standards of the Australian people are dependent upon the strength of the Australian economy, and the worth of any reform to our industrial relations system is the contribution it makes to the strengthening of our economy. We can have the most regulated industrial relations system on earth and that will not stop a recession throwing a million people out of work, as it did in the early 1990s. It will not stop a recession driving down the real wages of Australian people.The bitter reality for the Labor Party is that when it was last in government we had a far more highly regulated labour market than we have now but unemployment reached record heights under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition. The real wages of Australian workers were driven down. If the economy is malfunctioning, people will be thrown out of work and their wages will be suppressed. You therefore have to ask yourself a simple question in this whole industrial relations debate: which system will strengthen the Australian economy in the future? Will the path back to regulation strengthen the economy or will the path forward be to greater choice and flexibility? This government puts its faith in individual choice and flexibility. -  The member for Ballarat then left the chamber. 
 - Far from these reforms attacking the living standards of the Australian people, by the degree to which they will strengthen the Australian economy in the years ahead, they will create more jobs and provide higher real wages for the people of Australia and thereby strengthen the living standards of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. The APEC meeting on avian flu took place in his home town of Brisbane. It was an Australian hosted meeting of the principal pandemic and disaster preparedness officials of the 21 APEC economies, as well as a number of representatives from the Pacific Islands Forum and non-APEC South-East Asian countries. We were pleased to coordinate and host this meeting. It was the first time that these people from APEC had ever got together. I think the House would be aware that there is a risk of an influenza pandemic in the region but an important outcome of the meeting was that the participants concluded that such a pandemic was far from inevitable.The meeting, which was chaired by our APEC ambassador, recognised the need for better regional cooperation and the need for high-level commitment to effective surveillance, transparency, openness and rapid response. I think it is fair to say that we, on Australia's part, put a great deal of emphasis on the concept of transparency and openness, for very obvious reasons.Three practical proposals emerged from the meeting. Firstly, we will be conducting a region-wide series of simulation exercises in order to ensure that we are prepared if the worst happens. Secondly, it has been proposed that there be a rapid response initiative which will include available experts and capabilities which can be drawn rapidly from the different countries of the region. Thirdly, we will establish an effective regional communications system, including a register of the various coordinators in the various APEC economies. These proposals will be put to the APEC ministerial meeting in Busan, South Korea, in a couple of weeks time, and to the APEC leaders meeting after that.What we have been able to demonstrate by taking this initiative in APEC is the continuing importance and relevance of APEC and, if you like, the versatility of APEC to be able to adjust and deal with regional problems of this kind. The response from our APEC partners was very positive and very good. I am proud of the role that Australia played, not only in the initiative but in hosting the meeting.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I know how important this issue is to him. His constituents have distinctly suffered because of the ineptitude of the Queensland government in this matter. It is a fundamental principle of Medicare that public patients should receive free treatment in public hospitals. Medicare simply means that every single Australian is universally entitled to free treatment as a public patient in a public hospital. What is happening now is that the Queensland government is seeking to destroy this fundamental term of Australia's Medicare compact by denying to patients with health insurance their right to choose to be treated as a public patient and by imposing means testing on every other person.On 19 October Premier Peter Beattie put out a press release which said:The State Government will also examine the introduction of means testing and co-payments for non-urgent surgery ...To make sure that there was no mistake about this, Premier Beattie then went onto ABC radio and said:It's a means test. So those of you who fit within the means test, elective surgery, bang, you go through. The other list ... should be people who are either in private hospitals ... or they can be in a public hospital, as a private patient.What we have from the Queensland Premier and the Queensland health minister is a clear statement that, as far as Queensland Labor are concerned, universal Medicare is dead. What they are introducing in Queensland is a two-tier Medicare system. There are obviously problems in the public hospitals of Queensland - and let there be no doubt who is to blame. The person responsible for the public hospital disaster in Queensland is Premier Beattie, who has been consistently underfunding public hospitals in Queensland to the tune of $600 million a year, according to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That is despite a $2.1 billion increase in Commonwealth funding for Queensland public hospitals under the health care agreements and despite a $2.4 billion increase in Queensland's funding, thanks to the GST. Premier Beattie should spend this extra money on Queensland public hospitals. He should use the rivers of gold under the GST to support Queensland public hospitals. He should not be ripping off the people of Queensland - the 1.5 million people of Queensland with private health insurance - to bail him out of his public hospital problems.Queensland Labor members of this House should be hanging their heads in shame at this repudiation of Medicare by the Queensland Premier. I have here an election dodger from the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley's election dodger says: 'Wayne Swan fighting to save Medicare'. If he is fighting to save Medicare, he should immediately be picking a fight with the Queensland Premier who wants to destroy Medicare as it has been known in this country. As everyone in Australia now knows, the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. In Queensland, it is the only friend that Medicare has now got.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no. The answer generally to the question is that of course these measures are not extreme. These measures will make a major contribution. - Yes, they are big. I agree with the member for Cunningham that these are big changes. They are big changes designed by a government that believes in big economic reform for a big future for Australia. These reforms will make a major contribution to an even bigger economic cake for Australia in the future. I invite the member for Cunningham, just for a moment, to analyse this proposition - that is, you can have an elaborate industrial relations system, you can have all the rules and regulations and all the tribunals under the sun but if, at the end of the day, that industrial relations system does not contribute -  - With great respect, once again, to the member for Throsby, who once led the union movement in this country, surely she would accept that, at the end of the day, no matter what system you have, if you do not have a strong economy and prosperous firms, you have fewer jobs and lower wages. It is as simple as that. Therefore, the question that has to be asked by the member for Throsby, the member for Cunningham and all of those people who sit opposite is: what contribution will an industrial relations system make to the future strength of the economy? That is the fundamental question. Our great claim in relation to these reforms is that they will strengthen -  - The question was about the thing we all should be about, and that is the living standards of Australian men and women. The living standards of the men and women of Australia are the product of the strength of the Australian economy; they are not the product of some separately divined industrial relations system. - I am not only in order; I have almost finished. I will finish on this point: over 9½ years, every time that we have tried to change the industrial relations system the Labor Party has said the sky would fall in. The Labor Party has said we are going back to child labour. The Labor Party has said the plague would descend upon the land. None of that has happened. We have enjoyed the best living standards in our history. I say again: my guarantee is the record of my government.</DOC>

 - This government is ever vigilant about maintaining high levels of security in our transport network both internationally and domestically. The honourable member for Solomon, who represents an area which is particularly close to our northern neighbours, has a keen interest in ensuring that appropriate measures are taken to protect our relationship with countries from which we have important international travelling systems.I have previously advised the House of our memorandum of understanding and new bilateral agreement with Singapore in relation to transport security. We have also been working closely with the Philippines government on their domestic port initiative and to improve security at their domestic terminals and on their ferries. We are working also with a number of Pacific nations on security exercises and audits of their security systems. Naturally, we have a particular interest in those countries which are the last port of departure before arrival in Australia. Aviation overviews have been conducted on airports in Tonga, Fiji, Nauru and the Solomon Islands and overviews are planned for Apia, Port Vila, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Palau. There are also port audits being conducted in association with the secretariat of the Pacific community in Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Honiara, Vanuatu and Fiji, and there will be another five similar audits conducted this financial year.I am also pleased to advise the House that my department has recently signed a contract with its Indonesian counterpart to deliver a $1.1 million project aimed at strengthening aviation security in the Asia-Pacific region. This joint Indonesia-Australia aviation security project will be managed by staff of my department based in Jakarta and will see Australia and Indonesia working closely together to improve the security skills of airport operators and those in the transport industry in that region. This is part of a $10 million counter-terrorism capacity-building initiative with Indonesia which was announced in October 2002. We will be working with security experts in Jakarta and Denpasar and with the Indonesian government transport sector to improve aviation security skills and passenger baggage screening.All of this sort of thing will help to build confidence in the transport sector in our region. A secure transport sector is absolutely critical to the overall security of Australia and our working relationship with our near neighbours, and especially for the international visitors who travel so freely between our countries. This is part of a determined effort to improve the security of our region, particularly following September 11. With those sorts of issues we need to be involved in working closely with our neighbours to secure transport in our region.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know, because he has discussed it with me before, that he is particularly concerned about this incident. Let me make this point. There was a shocking incident in Poso, in Central Sulawesi, on 29 October. Five schoolgirls were on their way to school and they were attacked. As yet, the Indonesians have not identified the people who conducted the attack. One of the girls was badly injured, another escaped and three of them were beheaded. Like the Indonesian government, the Australian government - and, I am sure, the Australian parliament - strongly condemns these vicious attacks. We welcome the swift response by the government of Indonesia to this dreadful incident. President Yudhoyono strongly condemned the killings. He said:I condemn this barbarous killing, whoever the perpetrators are and whatever their motives.He then called an emergency cabinet meeting and sent Indonesia's police chief and other government officials to Poso to assist with the government's security response and its investigations. I understand that up to 800 additional police and security personnel have been deployed to Poso to ensure security. The situation in Poso - where there are Christians and Muslims alike - has, over time, been reasonably stable, and I understand that the situation remains stable.We support the Indonesian government's commitment to an open, pluralistic and tolerant society that respects human rights and the right of people of different religions to practise those religions. These girls were all Christians. We do not know at this stage the identity of the people who attacked them. They were wearing masks and were dressed in black, apparently. The Indonesians are still trying to establish their identity.I very much appreciate the member for Wakefield raising this matter, because it was a particularly horrific incident. The girls' heads were found well away from the location of the killing, which is a particularly macabre aspect of the incident. It has truly horrified the Indonesian government. Our officials have talked with Indonesian officials about the incident, and the Indonesians have told us that the whole situation was particularly horrific. I can only praise the response of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to this, which has been as I have described it. I know that the Indonesians will do everything they can to bring to justice the people responsible for these horrific murders.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and also for the fantastic work he does for his constituents, particularly in relation to the upgrading of roads in his region. I visited the member's electorate last week at his invitation and also at the invitation of the state member, Andrew Fraser, to see first-hand the position of the Pacific Highway. I can, unfortunately, confirm that I have seen the claims made by the New South Wales government - in particular, the New South Wales roads minister, Joe Tripodi - that the Australian government has slashed funding for roads in New South Wales. These claims are simply untrue. Over the past 10 years we have provided some $656 million to assist the New South Wales government with the upgrading and duplication of the Pacific Highway, which, of course, is a state highway. We have seen significant improvements on the Pacific Highway. Some 44 per cent of the highway will be duplicated once the three projects currently under construction are completed. The Australian government has significantly increased the amount of money available to the New South Wales government over the next three years for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. There is $160 million per year over the next three years, or $480 million, to assist New South Wales with the upgrading of the Pacific Highway.Since the day Minister Tripodi was appointed as roads minister, I have not heard one constructive comment from him in relation to assisting the people of New South Wales. I met with him on 30 August and offered to bring forward $30 million to this financial year to enable the Bonville deviation around Coffs Harbour to be started immediately. At that meeting, I also offered to assist the New South Wales government with urgent safety works on a section of the highway where far too many people have been killed. I have not heard back from Minister Tripodi. I wrote to Minister Tripodi on 15 September, re-emphasising the offer to bring forward $30 million and help him with the safety works. More than six week later, I still have not received a reply from Minister Tripodi.People's lives are at risk on this highway. Far too many people have died. Minister Tripodi should get off his backside and start working for the people of New South Wales. It is too important a portfolio for him to play politics. If he cannot start dealing with the people of New South Wales with some decency and some honesty, then the Premier of New South Wales should remove him from the portfolio. I table the letter I wrote to Minister Tripodi.</DOC>

 - The answer to that is no. What that provision and what other provisions of the act make very clear is the proposition that, as under the current law, an employer can make as a condition of newly employing somebody that that person sign an AWA. But, in relation to an existing employee, you cannot force somebody onto an AWA as a condition of continuing employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I appreciate how important this issue is to her, as a mother of young children. I can inform her that immunisation has been one of the great success stories of the Howard government. Since 1996 childhood immunisation rates have gone up from about 50 per cent to well over 90 per cent. In 1996 federal spending on vaccines was just $13 million; in the last financial year it was almost $300 million. So vaccination is one of the signature policies of this government.And there is more good news. From 1 November - that is to say, from yesterday - all infants will have access to free chickenpox vaccine under the National Immunisation Program. This will save parents up to $55, which they previously might have had to spend on vaccinations. For many people, chickenpox is quite a serious illness. In an average year up to seven people can die and some 1,500 people are hospitalised as a result of chickenpox. This measure is a further strengthening of the National Immunisation Program and is another sign that the Howard government takes the public health of Australia very seriously indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question and for his very strong support of small business. Over the past 12 months I have listened to what small business have had to say, and what they want is relief from unfair dismissal. They want the flexibility to sit down with their employees to reach agreement for their mutual benefit. So small business strongly support the government's workplace relations - not just for those reasons, important though they are. They support the government's workplace relations because they know that they will get a system that will be easier, that will be simpler and that will be more flexible. It will cut the red tape, it will cut the cost of doing business, it will remove that duplication and it will boost jobs. For all of those reasons, small business support the government's workplace relations. From a recent survey by the Office of the Employment Advocate, we know that 82 per cent of small businesses with AWAs have reported improved flexibility. Sixty per cent of them have reported improved productivity. It is no wonder that small business is such a strong supporter of this government's workplace relations. It enables them to get on with the job of doing their business.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Richmond: it is not an extreme attack. The fair pay conditions will ensure that that does not happen. In relation to penalty rates, as the legislation makes quite clear - The member for Calwell then left the chamber. - The honourable member for Richmond talks about 10,000 low-income families in her electorate. I would want to see a profile of the employment conditions. Some of those people would no doubt be employed and would continue to be employed on awards. If she reads the legislation she will understand the continuing application of award conditions to those people. If she bothers to read the legislation she will understand that, in relation to people who are on agreements, penalty rates and loadings will be issues of negotiation unless they are specifically referred to in the agreement. The law will provide that the provisions of the award, which include penalty rates and loadings, will in fact continue. That question is all of a piece with an attempt by the Labor Party not to argue this issue rationally but rather to lift a crescendo of fear and misrepresentation. The Australian people have more intelligence than that. The Australian people will assess this legislation in a far calmer and more balanced fashion than the Labor Party has demonstrated over the last hour. We have seen over the last hour the Labor Party at its noisy worst. It is a reminder of why they lost the last -

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and I thank him for organising an aged care forum in his electorate, where we discussed these types of issues. Can I assure the member that the Australian government is committed to ensuring that not only does our aged care system meet the current needs of older Australians but it will be flexible enough to meet changing needs and demands into the future.Research shows that the baby boomer generation, the largest generation in Australia's history and the next 'older generation', the first of whom will be turning 60 next year, will be demanding more choice and more options in how, when, where and by whom aged care services are delivered. Already we are seeing an increasing demand for services to be delivered at home. The government have responded to this demand for choice. We have doubled the number of community care places in the planning ratio. We have significantly increased the number of community aged care places from the 4,000 packages available when we came to office to the 34,000 packages now available to older Australians. We have introduced a new model of care, the Extended Aged Care at Home program. There are now over 2,000 extended aged care at home packages available - that is, high-level care for people with dementia, and a world first.We have also significantly increased support for carers, the people who provide support for older Australians to remain at home. We have had a sevenfold increase in the National Respite for Carers Program, from $19 million to about $135 million. This year in the budget a further $208 million for respite care was targeted at specific areas of need including, for the first time, government subsidised respite for working carers. So this is a reformist government. We have had nine years of reforms in aged care. The industry is responding magnificently and older Australians are benefiting. As for Labor's attitude to older people, they neglected them in government and they have abandoned them in opposition.</DOC>

I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - May I repeat what a very successful Labour Party leader said.

The rights of the unemployed have been ignored in the past. I think, in the words of Tony Blair, when you start with fairness in the workplace -  -  - Mr Speaker - The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - I repeat: for the first time, the wage-fixing authority will be required to take into account the interests and the rights of the unemployed. I would also point out to the honourable gentleman who asked me this question that the question I was asked yesterday concluded, interestingly enough, with the question:Does that not mean that, rather than a fair go, the so-called Fair Pay Commission can set low and unfair wages?And I answered no.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I can inform the House that, over the last 9½ years under a coalition government, real wages have grown by 15 per cent in the Australian economy. Are there any alternative views?Some of us were in the House at the time the previous Labor government was in office and we recall then Treasurer Keating coming to this dispatch box. One of his proudest claims was that under Labor real wages had declined. He used to say it as a badge of honour. Over 13 long years of Labor government, real wages increased by only 1.2 per cent. -  - Real wages increased by 1.2 per cent in 13 years compared to 15 per cent over 9½ years. The member for Melbourne then left the chamber.  - What has given Australians the chance of a job and a real wage increase is strong economic management. Economic reform contributes to strong economic management, and industrial relations reform will give this country opportunities over the decades which lie ahead. The Labor Party is opposing economic reform again, as it has for the last 9½ years. -  - For 9½ years the Labor Party has opposed economic reform, balancing the budget, paying off debt and introducing the GST. All of the big economic reforms were opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and this is yet another scare campaign. The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that the minimum wage would be undermined and family friendly places would be abolished in Australia. Can I remind the House that this is not even a new scare campaign. This was precisely the scare campaign -  Opposition members - Boring, boring! - This was precisely the same scare campaign that the Leader of the Opposition used when he opposed economic reform in relation to the GST. In relation to the GST he said that it was 'a cloud hanging over the people of Australia - a cloud that will become a deluge and wash away the conditions of many Australian families'. He promised that he would roll back the GST. He stood in the way of economic reform. He is doing it again. -  The member for Lilley then left the chamber.

 - The answer, I repeat, is no. I will tell you what the Fair Pay Commission is obliged under the bill to do. Let me read what it is obliged to do:The primary objective of the Fair Pay Commission will be to promote the economic prosperity of the people of Australia. In giving effect to this objective the Fair Pay Commission will have to consider - The very first thing it will have to consider is - The capacity for the unemployed and low paid to obtain and remain in employment;I regard that as a statement of absolute fairness. 10000 SPEAKER, TheThe SPEAKER - Order! The member for Sydney will remove herself under standing order 94(a). The member for Sydney then left the chamber. 
 - I regard it as the first requirement for fairness in a wage fixing system that you pay some regard to the rights of the unemployed.

 - Mr Speaker, the situation, through a combination of the continuing provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and the amendments, is as follows: as has been the case since 1996, an employer is entitled to say to a new employee, 'As a condition of your employment, you must sign an AWA.' That has been the law since 1996. It remains the case that it is unlawful to terminate somebody's employment because they refuse to sign an AWA.

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I know how concerned she and a lot of her constituents - and people in Western Australia generally - are about the situation in Zimbabwe. The government continues to be appalled by the egregious breaches of human rights perpetrated by President Mugabe's regime. As a result of his mismanagement and negligence, over four million people in Zimbabwe require food aid urgently. Rather tragically, the regime of President Mugabe has this week confirmed that it has rejected a proposal of the United Nations to provide $US30 million worth of aid to provide temporary shelter, blankets and food for victims of what is called 'operation clean-up', in which the Mugabe regime bulldozed the homes of thousands of people. This simply disgraceful action by the Mugabe regime is symptomatic of the performance of his government over a very long period of time. The seizure of farms has been legitimised by recent constitutional changes which prohibit court challenges and prevent critics from travelling abroad. The fact is that, in the short term, there is little chance of the situation improving.I noticed in today's media that the deputy minister for agriculture in Zimbabwe has admitted that the country has run out food because land had been given to people with, as he put it, 'no passion for farming'. Land has been stripped from professional farmers of all different colours and races. Much of it has been handed to cronies of President Mugabe who have no interest in or knowledge of farming. This, of course, has now been exposed by the honest statement of the deputy minister for agriculture.The Australian government, along with other governments - and I particularly mention the New Zealand government; the former New Zealand Foreign Minister, Phil Goff, and I talked a lot about this - will continue to do what we can to pressure the international community to take further action against Zimbabwe. We will pressure countries like South Africa to be more robust in standing up to President Mugabe. We will pressure members of the Security Council to consider a referral of President Mugabe's regime to the International Criminal Court. Indeed, bearing in mind Zimbabwe's economic performance and the ravages that President Mugabe has brought to the economy and livelihoods of his people, I would like to see Zimbabwe expelled from the International Monetary Fund. I know that the member for Pearce will be pleased that we will vigorously continue to stand up to the regime of President Mugabe.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Makin for her question. I appreciate her strong support for measures such as the private health insurance rebate, which the Howard government put in place and which has helped to rescue private health insurance from the oblivion into which it was sinking thanks to the policies of the former government. This government obviously does support that rebate, but I have to say I am not so confident about all members in this parliament. I was reading a very interesting book over the sitting break. I found some quite interesting words in that book, and I am going to quote them to the House: 'I like Gillard because she has a go - feisty, irreverent, good sense of humour, the closest thing we have to charisma in the caucus.' Mr Speaker, you can understand why Mr Latham said that when you look at the front bench. - This very interesting book contains a lot of information about the attitude of members opposite to private health insurance. As the member for Lalor said when extracts from this book first came out, the author of it, Mr Latham, was 'a thinker', 'a formidable parliamentarian' and 'a moving advocate'. It was quite a mutual admiration society. And she said that this book is a 'very truthful book'. This truthful book says -  - The book says on the subject of health and the private health insurance rebate that Medicare Gold was 'my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate'. This truthful book went on: 'It required a lot of work to model the private insurance implications and to secure the cooperation of the states, all handled by Gillard.'  So this very truthful book, which praises to the skies the member for Lalor, also reveals her participation in the giant Labor conspiracy to get rid of the private health insurance rebate.

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. I am glad that he has raised it, because this issue has been the subject of some misrepresentation in the media this morning. The situation is that, under the new workplace relations proposals - The member for Shortland then left the chamber. - If the parliament enacts the amendments, the situation will be that a person whose position is terminated as a result of a bona fide restructuring will not be entitled to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. This will clarify the situation where now, in some cases - there was a well-known case involving 16 employees of the Blair Athol coalmine in 1997-98 -  - I understand that this is an issue of some interest to the parliament. I am perfectly happy to courteously respond to the question from the member for Perth and will do my best to respond to it courteously, but if those opposite want to stop me from doing that I will just sit down and let another question be asked. I do not intend to try to give a reasonable answer through a cacophony of noise. I simply do not intend to do that. -  - The situation is that this change clarifies the situation existing now where employees on some occasions - and I quoted the Blair Athol case, which would be well known to the member for Perth - have double-dipped by taking redundancy payments and then proceedings to the unfair -  The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 - Under the proposed changes, an employee will be able to challenge in the Industrial Relations Commission the employer's claim that the termination was for a genuine operational reason. The commission would then make an assessment on the termination. This means that an employee would be able to make an unfair dismissal claim if the commission found that the employee's dismissal was not on the basis of genuine operational reasons. The mere assertion by an employer that a termination was for operational reasons will not be sufficient. In addition, when terminating for operational reasons, because the employer no longer requires the job to be done, they must of course give the required period of notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice as prescribed by the legislation. All employees will continue to be able to access unlawful determination provisions, regardless of the size of their employer's business. This means that an employee would be able to seek redress if they were terminated for a prohibited reason, including discriminatory reasons such as race or age. When making a claim for an unlawful termination, the burden of proving that the termination was not for a prohibited reason falls on the employer.Under Work Choices, redundancy pay in cases of genuine redundancy will continue to be in awards. Provisions on redundancy pay and agreements will also continue to apply. Redundancy pay will remain a matter that can be included in an agreement. It stands to reason that, in any fair industrial relations system, redundancy for a bona fide operational reason cannot be regarded as an unfair dismissal, and these changes are not going to alter that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and his interest. As the House will know, the government was appalled by and condemned completely the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri of Lebanon in Beirut in February. It was a car bombing that killed 22 other people at the same time. As members know, as a result of international pressure and in a growing environment for democracy in the Middle East, Lebanon was blessed not only with free elections in May-June but also with the withdrawal of Syrian forces in April. So some good came out of a terrible thing.On 21 October, the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission led by Detlev Mehlis, a German lawyer, submitted its report on the assassination to the UN Security Council. The investigation found:Given the infiltration of Lebanese institutions and society by the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services working in tandem, it would be difficult to envisage a scenario whereby such a complex assassination plot could have been carried out without their knowledge.On 31 October, the UN Security Council unanimously passed resolution 1636, calling on Syria to cooperate fully in continuing investigations to clarify unresolved questions. For the record, Australia very strongly supports that resolution. It is essential that the perpetrators of this vile act of terrorism be brought to justice. The resolution sets up a United Nations committee to list individuals designated by the UN commission or by the Lebanese government as being involved in this act of terrorism, and all states will be obliged to prevent their travel and to freeze their funds. The Australian Federal Police assisted the Lebanese authorities in the early days of this investigation, and anyone in Australia with any relevant information should certainly share it with the Australian Federal Police.Can I say in conclusion, and I know the honourable member for Kooyong will agree with this, I completely condemn the outrageous performance by the Syrian foreign minister at the United Nations Security Council where he made what I thought was a grotesque and insensitive comparison between Syria's relationship to the Hariri assassination and the British government's to the 7 July bombings. I thought Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary and a good friend of this country, responded with great dignity and effectiveness. It is time for Syria to stop all equivocations and for it to recognise that it constitutes a real danger to peace in the region and that its support for terrorism is completely unacceptable. As for the democracy that is now flourishing in both Iraq and Lebanon, on either side of Syria, those democracies will not be intimidated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his very strong support for public education. The Prime Minister announced during the 2004 election that a re-elected Howard coalition government would invest an additional $1 billion over the next four years in Australia's government and non-government school infrastructure. Seven hundred million dollars of that would be specifically for government state schools across the country but, unlike with the usual clipboard carriers that turn up from education departments, this money would actually go specifically to the projects developed by parent communities, P&amp;Cs and school councils and signed off by school principals. I am very pleased to inform the House that the first $105 million of projects in the first calendar year of this program have been announced. Those round 1 projects are now rolling out around the country. The member for Bonner has worked very hard to get money for the Wondall Heights State School in his electorate. It is very interesting, when you read in part the application by the parents from Wondall Heights State School, that it gives you an idea of how state governments are neglecting public education. The parents were after $15,200. They said:Existing toilets have been in use since school opened and have become very run down. The toilets are smelly, urinals are rusted, pipes need replacing, flooring in disrepair.They said children will not use them because they smell. Similarly in the state of Queensland, at the Upper Barron State School in the electorate of Kennedy the parents had to fill in an application to us that said, 'We wish to replace existing broken desks and chairs and equipment.' The member for Lindsay, for example, has contacted the Glenbrook Public School in her electorate to inform them that they will receive $22,000 to replace carpet which is 20 years old.Now we have 2,600 government schools that have been funded for 4,000 projects of this nature this year - that is $105 million. There are another 6½ thousand schools that have applied; they are on the government's help list. So this government has a help list; we have a list of schools that we want to help. It will extend to more than 8½ thousand schools. We have members who ring schools and inform them, for example, that they have got $45,000 at Bermagui for play equipment. In the Labor Party world, if the Leader of the Opposition wins the next federal election, on the first day after his election the member for Jagajaga will ring the Ivanhoe Girls Grammar School in her electorate and say, 'Jenny here; I am the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia' - a scary thought - and then she will say, 'I'm ringing to tell you we're cutting your money.' This government believes in helping Australian schools and their parents; the Labor Party believes in hit lists and punishing parental sacrifice.</DOC>

 - Despite the government's best efforts at encouraging higher participation by apprentices - and that includes lifting the living away from home allowance, giving an allowance for tool kits and other inducements - country Australia is where the highest shortage of skill levels and apprenticeships exists. There are many instances of employers and contractors who have had to put contracts on hold and put on hold their expansion ideas. The government has put together this visa with a great deal of consideration. This visa will not - I repeat: will not - disadvantage any young Australian wishing to become an apprentice. This visa will not disadvantage any young Australian wishing to become an apprentice in country Australia. Employers are bound and have to make every attempt to get an apprenticeship locally - in fact, they have to prove that they are unable to get an apprentice locally. That means also that local bodies, like councils, have to agree that they are unable to access an apprentice locally before they are able to get an apprentice from overseas to fill the position. - It would be a wonderful thing if apprenticeship vacancies in country Australia were side by side with people wanting to fill those positions. But the reality is that, with Australia's record low unemployment, it is simply not the position. I must repeat that no employer will be able to disadvantage any young Australian or Australian permanent resident who wishes to have an apprenticeship in country Australia. This government sees no reason why the prosperity of country Australia should be disadvantaged because the union movement runs the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the House that the federal government has announced another round of funding to support the upgrade of regional airports and to improve their security, including $292,000 for the Ceduna airport in the electorate of Grey. The honourable member for Grey takes a particular interest in aviation issues, especially the challenging situation to provide air services in his electorate at the present time. He has been very effective in representing the needs of that area. But there are another 10 airports that have been included in this round of funding under the program totalling $2.3 million. I was pleased to be in Cooktown in the honourable member for Leichhardt's electorate last week where the Cooktown and Coen airports have been included in this round of the program. Indeed, we now have 52 airports around Australia in regional areas that have participated in this upgrading program which is providing some basic security measures such as fencing, lighting, CCTV and the like. It helps to make a difference in ensuring that our regional airports are secure.I have listened quite a bit to the Leader of the Opposition complaining that this government has done nothing about airport security or that we have neglected it - 'sitting on our hands' I think were the exact words that he used. It may be of interest to the House to note that this government has committed close to $500 million to airport security activities and to upgrade the security in aviation around Australia. I went back and looked at the Labor Party's election promise in 2004 about what they would do in relation to airport security. There were lots of pictures on the front of the former Leader of the Opposition -  - I make the point that our commitment is 10 times anything the Labor Party offered in the last federal election campaign.</DOC>

 - First of all, the premise of the question is manifestly not only wrong but utterly untrue. This government, of course, would in no circumstances have been in favour of any support being provided to Saddam Hussein's regime, unlike those opposite who opposed his overthrow. On this side of the House, we supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. -  - Secondly, when, as I understand it - I do not have the date with me but it was around 2000 - the United Nations had raised with it by the Canadian mission to the United Nations a general concern about contracts of the Australian Wheat Board, the United Nations looked into that and also raised it with us. Our officials, as I understand it, spoke to the Wheat Board. The Wheat Board explained to them that they believed - as they still explain to this very day - there was nothing unusual or inappropriate about those contracts. That information was passed back to the United Nations. The United Nations was responsible for the investigation -  - As has been explained over and over again and as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade explained in the estimates committee today, it was not the job of the government to approve the contracts; it was the job of United Nations to approve the contracts. This is a simply monstrous implication coming from the opposition that officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are involved in some sort of corrupt activity. That is yet another example of the member for Griffith blackening the name of Public Service officers. These officers were not corrupt; they did not act in any inappropriate way -  - I make the point: the member for Griffith has repeatedly been blackening the names of officers of my department. On the Lateline program two days ago he was asked if he believed that there is corruption within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the ministers in relation to this, and he said that he did not know. In other words, he has suggested - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I recognise the member for Cowper's electorate is a major exporter from the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I am pleased to inform the member for Cowper that the international trade in goods and services statistics released by the ABS last week showed Australia's exports in September reached $14.7 billion. That is the highest level for the month of September on record - $14.7 billion. The underlying strength in exports is displayed in the fact that, for the first three months in the 2005-06 financial year, exports were 12.9 per cent higher than the first three months of the 2004-05 financial year. So we are on a glide path that is increasing in terms of our export efforts. In the financial year to date, exceptionally strong growth has been recorded in iron ore exports, up $1.3 billion, and coal exports, up $2.3 billion, compared to the same period last financial year.The member for Cowper will be interested to know that, as we move into 2006, the exports of LNG to China will begin and, of course, a lot of the equipment that is used to liquefy the natural gas from the North West Shelf comes from the member for Cowper's electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Those exports will also feed into increasing the statistics as far as our export effort is concerned. Members would be aware that last year we reached the highest ever level of exports out of Australia of $162 billion. But we need to do more. We need to create a better environment and a more competitive environment.If our export community is to continue to grow and prosper, we need to work together to implement fair, practical and sensible changes to our workplace relations system. The largest manufacturing exporter in Australia, the automotive industry represented by the FCAI, supports the government's view that we need to reform workplace relations in this country. The FCAI says we need these reforms to be more competitive and more efficient overseas in those markets. A move towards a single national workplace relations system is crucial to this government's commitment to improve productivity, create more jobs and increase living standards for Australian families. At the risk of being criticised, I invoke the words of a former great Australian on this issue. For the benefit of the Australian Labor Party, particularly the Queenslanders on the other side of the House, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1987 said:In industrial relations issues, as in economic ones, the problems we see in Queensland cannot be solved by State action alone. It is critical for Queensland that the next Federal government creates an environment in which real industrial relations reform can occur.That is exactly what we want to do. We want to create reform; we want to create an environment so that the Queensland economy and the national economy can prosper and individuals and Australian families can prosper as well. The Australian Labor Party needs to get on board with these reforms and join with the manufacturing industries in Australia which want to see these reforms so that they can be more competitive in the international marketplace.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question and I can inform him that the government expects shortly to introduce legislation to establish Australia's Future Fund - a fund which is determined to try to protect and strengthen Australia against the financial costs which we will face over decades to come in relation to the ageing of the population. This is far-sighted legislation - an initiative which very few countries in the world will be able to match - to ensure that to future generations we bequeath an Australian nation which is in far stronger shape to deal with the demographic changes that are going to come over our society and, in fact, other Western societies over the next several decades. Today the government has announced that the Chairman of the Board of Guardians of the Future Fund will be Mr David Murray, who I believe is well known and well respected in Australia's business community. The government will be announcing the additional guardians, whose role it will be to oversee the fund and ensure that the fund is locked away for future generations to finance the ageing of the population. -  - I hear interjections from the opposition about protecting the fund, and nothing could be more important than to protect this fund against would-be robbers. One has already identified himself because I have here a copy of the Northern Star of 11 June 2005. Have a listen to this:Federal Labor's plans for improving the Pacific Highway ... depend on plans to commandeer Treasurer Peter Costello's 'Future Fund'.Labor leader Kim Beazley told the Northern Star he is going to commandeer the Future Fund. The reason we are having a board of guardians - and I will table that excerpt - is to make sure that future generations of Australians can be protected, that their financial future can be secured and that the liabilities of the federal government - which are already about $80 billion and expected to grow to $140 billion by 2020 - are adequately provided for. This is a mechanism that all the states have already put in place and the Commonwealth has lagged on. But if we start to accommodate these things now, if we set this up at arm's length and if we ensure that we have guardians who defend the national interest, then Australia can face the future confidently, as well prepared as any other economy in the world for the changes coming over us to give young people the opportunity for the future that they deserve.</DOC>

We regard them as important. We do not regard the public information campaign as being partisan. It does not involve any criticism of the Australian Labor Party, it offers not a word of criticism of the member for Banks or any of his esteemed colleagues and it is not in any way critical of the trade union movement; it merely explains the benefit of a long-needed, meritorious policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. This government will be protecting things in industrial relations such as the new Australian fair pay and conditions standard, which relates to ordinary times of work, annual leave, sick leave and carers leave. There will also be protections in relation to agreements, because the award system will remain as a default provision and therefore a protection for workers. This protection runs quite contrary to the shameless misinformation that we have had from the Australian Labor Party and the union movement after the past week.Let me outline four matters on which we have had a shameless misinformation campaign from the ALP and the union movement. The first claim is that employers can force existing employees onto AWAs - to quote the member for Perth, 'Take the AWA or take the sack.' This is quite wrong. It will continue to be unlawful for an existing employee to be forced onto an AWA. The second claim is that employees dismissed on the grounds of operational redundancy will have no right to challenge the matter. Again, that is totally wrong. An employee has the right to dispute the employer's operational reasons as part of the unfair dismissal process. On top of that, any claim made in this regard will be determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.The third claim is that workers could be jailed for discussing the terms of their AWA. Once again, that is totally wrong. There are sanctions in the act which apply to officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate divulging confidential information about employees on AWAs. That will be extended to those who are passed information, if it is done so inappropriately, by an officer of the Office of the Employment Advocate. But the reality is that ordinary workers in Australia - and, indeed, employers - are at liberty to discuss their AWA if they wish to.The fourth misleading and wrong claim is that employers could sack their entire work force and then re-employ them the next day on inferior working conditions - something Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, was claiming. Once again, that is absolutely the wrong. Firstly, if anybody were to do that, they would have to pay to an employee anything which had accrued in terms of their redundancy and entitlements. Secondly, if they were seeking to do that and to re-employ the workers, they would have to re-employ them under the existing terms and conditions.So, once again, the facts of the issue stand in marked contrast to the misleading claims that are being made by the ALP and the ACTU. The absurdity of these claims indicates the level of debate we are getting from the ALP and the ACTU. The Leader of the Opposition said the divorce rate in Australia would increase as a result of Work Choices. We have had claims from a Victorian Labor member of parliament that women and children would die as a result of these changes. We have even had claims that life expectancy would fall. How absurd and ridiculous!</DOC>

 - If the matters I outlined in my previous answer did not point to the absurdity of the case being mounted by the Leader of the Opposition, his question just did so. Why is that? The reality is that this government has put in place protections for workers who are looking at an AWA. Part of that protection is that a worker, an employee, can appoint a bargaining agent. That bargaining agent can be an official of the union or anybody that employee wishes to appoint. There may well be circumstances in which a worker would prefer to have their accountant appointed to be their bargaining agent. The reality is that a union official can be appointed as a bargaining agent. Mr Combet can be appointed as a bargaining agent. - Any person who is of sufficient expertise or interest in a matter can be chosen by an individual worker to serve as their bargaining agent. If they want Kim Beazley, they can have him.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Also, if the House will indulge me, may I say how pleased I am to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden here. She is enormously welcome. Let me also add that so are the mayors of Kangaroo Island and Alexandrina council, which are in the electorate of Mayo.The cruise ship Seabourn Spirit was attacked by rocket propelled grenades and automatic weapons - we think about 150 kilometres off the Somali coast - on Saturday, 5 November. That is a bit further off the coast than we had earlier imagined. We do not know the motives of those who attacked this ship, whether they had terrorist motives in order to try to kill people or whether they wanted to rob it or even to try to highjack it. That is a matter that will be investigated and is being investigated.Our consul from the Australian High Commission in Port Louis, in Mauritius, has now visited the ship, which is three kilometres off the Seychelles, and has confirmed that there were 22 Australians onboard the ship - 19 passengers and three crew; nine male and 10 female passengers as well as the crew. Mercifully, all of the 22 Australians are safe. In fact, all of the complement of the ship is safe. Only one of the crew, I believe, was injured. That was the only injury that was sustained. Our consular officer at our high commission in Nairobi will travel to Mombassa, in Kenya, to provide assistance to the Australians who have been stranded in Mombassa as a result of the ship being diverted to the Seychelles.My department's travel advisory for Somalia does advise seafarers there is a risk of piracy occurring in coastal areas and territorial waters off Somalia. More than that, of course, there is a broader risk around the world. That is not to underestimate the risks of piracy - I think they are familiar to many members of the House - but possible terrorist attacks on shipping cannot be completely ruled out.The Australian government are focused on this issue in our own immediate region. We part funded a counterterrorism exercise, called Ready Pacifica, which starts, by coincidence, tomorrow at the Pacific Forum Secretariat in Fiji. It will be the first of its kind involving Pacific countries, all of whom will participate. The exercise will focus on border security, but with particular focus on maritime security, cooperation, coordination and legal frameworks. It is important that we work with Pacific Island countries to test capabilities in responding to emerging terrorist threats and to help identify areas where the capacities of countries in our own immediate region to deal with these problems can be enhanced by the skills and capacity that we have here in this country.</DOC>

 - The question of whether these changes are fair will be determined by an objective analysis of the aggregate provisions of the legislation. If you look at the aggregate provisions of the legislation, you find - for example, in relation to the minimum wage - for the first time a specific injunction that the interests of the unemployed be looked at. As I said last week -  - They interject in the name of fairness. I will again remind those who sit opposite of the famous words of a successful Labour leader, Tony Blair, when he addressed the Trade Union Congress in 1997 in Great Britain. He said, 'Fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' An integral part of the injunctions given to the Fair Pay Commission is to take into account the interests of the unemployed, as well as the requirement for proper minimum wage considerations, the strength of the Australian economy and the other things that are listed in the conditions that are attached to the fair pay condition. When you look at all of those, you see that fairness to the unemployed is integral to the proceedings of the Fair Pay Commission. I think that demonstrates that this legislation, so far from needing to be put aside, properly meets the Australian fair go tradition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. As his question indicates, Australians have benefited from increases in real wages in this country since this government has been in office - not only ordinary working Australians but, indeed, pensioners as well, because pensions are linked to average male weekly earnings and set at 25 per cent of this figure. That is important because this was the first government to link pensions to average weekly earnings. It was something that was never done in the way in which this government has done through legislation -  - If the Leader of the Opposition were correct he would able to produce his legislation. The reality is that this was the government that legislated to make that link, and you know it, sport! - In the face of this, what we have seen is an increase in real wages for Australians and, because of that, we have seen increases in pensions for Australians. Despite this, we have another campaign of misinformation by the Labor Party. I came across a letter that the member for Cowan is distributing to constituents in his electorate, in which he says in part, 'Just a one per cent per annum reduction in wages growth will leave a single pensioner almost $20 per fortnight worse off and a couple $30 worse off.' Apart from the very dubious mathematics -  - involved in that claim -  - it is based on a flawed assumption. This government has been about increasing real wages, unlike the Labor Party, which was about reducing real wages. Mr Speaker, ask yourself: who in this parliament was part of a government that reduced real wages? The Leader of the Opposition. Not only that, he actually claimed credit for it. - This year on 1 April, the Leader of the Opposition said:We achieved 13 years of wage restraint under the Accord. The wage share of GDP came down from 60.1 per cent when we took office down to the lowest it had been since 1968. We - that is, the ALP - left office with the wage share of GDP at 55.3 per cent.That is from 60 per cent down to 55 per cent. - On top of that, we had the former Prime Minister and former Treasurer of the ALP government, Mr Keating -  - The reality is that, under the Labor Party, real wages went up by 1.2 per cent; under this government, they have gone up by 14.9 per cent - 1.2 per cent versus 14.9 per cent. This was reinforced by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when, in an interview in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, he is quoted as saying:When Labor was in office, under the accord with the ACTU, with all power, what did we do? We engineered a fall in real wages ...If the honourable member for Cowan and others on the other side are going to write to their constituents about changes in wages, they ought to adopt what has happened in the last 10 years - that is, unlike when their side were in government and real wages were going down, what has happened under this government is that real wages have gone up.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Representing the largest regional seat in Australia, the member for Kalgoorlie recognises the importance of exports, particularly from his electorate, in terms of employment generation and growth in his electorate. Of course, one in five jobs in Australia is related to exports, but in regional Australia - and this is particularly so in the seat of Kalgoorlie - one in four jobs relies on exports for its maintenance. Australia's export performance and sound economy are obviously benefiting regional and rural Australia. A lot of the growth that is coming out of that part of Western Australia, represented by the member for Kalgoorlie, is underpinning the economic and employment growth taking place in Australia today.A report prepared for the Australian Local Government Association on the state of the regions supports the wellbeing and improvement in circumstances that exist in regional Australia today. It shows that our policies have helped regional Australia share in the nation's ongoing economic prosperity, and a lot of that economic prosperity is being generated by the electorate of Kalgoorlie.The report prepared by National Economics demonstrates on a couple of points that regions which suffered from low population growth over the 1990s are now seeing growth accelerate in their areas. That is good news in rural areas, where attractive lifestyles are available. Secondly, per capita employment has grown across regional Australia, with an above average decline in unemployment in what the report describes as rural lifestyle regions. Thirdly, and most importantly, net disposable household income has increased in most rural areas. These are very important statistics in terms of underpinning the economic strengthening that has taken place in regional Australia. It has certainly been an objective of our government over the last 10 years to put in place policies to reverse the general decline in the position of regional Australia in the overall national economy. This report supports the fact that the policies we have been putting in place are now working.One of the interesting and more important recommendations in the report is the recognition of the clear benefits gained from extending quality broadband coverage into regional and rural Australia, as this will increase the capacity of enterprises to export and employ in regional Australia. It is well known that the government have announced that, as at 1 January 2006, we will invest $1.1 billion over the following four years in rolling out broadband capacity right across Australia into those regional areas, to continue to strengthen the economies and the opportunities in regional Australia and to build on what has been identified in this report as 'the strengthening of regional Australia'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I was rather surprised to read in the Australian on Saturday that the Howard government was concealing especially commissioned advice from the Treasury. It was certainly news to me. When inquiries were made of the Treasury -  - For once he has said something halfway decent in the House, and he is absolutely right: it was so secret that this report had not even been written. That is how secret it was. Not only was it so secret that it had not even been written; it was so secret that it had been neither written nor released, which I have to say was one of those top-secret things. In fact the Treasury - The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - The Treasury put out a press release on Saturday - The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - In fact the Treasury put out a press release on Saturday confirming that it had not been commissioned to provide specific advice, nor had it written a report, nor had the report been concealed. So I regret to inform the honourable member for Lilley that the story was wrong. In fact I pay tribute to him for actually getting a false story up on the front page of the Australian. It rather reminded me of a $600 payment that did not exist. - Mr Speaker, the member for Lilley is a swan -  
A government member - No, he's a rooster. - who metamorphoses into a rooster early in the morning: as the cock crows the swan flies off. - I would be surprised if Mr Smith and Senator Conroy think of the member for Lilley when they mate, Mr Speaker. They would be needing a good deal of pharmaceutical treatment if they did.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I think all members of the House will be aware that there have been violent riots, including arson, looting and widespread damage to property, in the northern Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois and in other parts of Paris, and indeed now into other cities in France, such as Lille, Marseilles, Toulouse, Strasbourg and Nice.Sadly, the rioting has the potential to spread still further, bearing in mind that the riots are now into their 10th day. On Saturday, rioters burnt nearly 1,300 cars and over 300 arrests were made, meaning that a total of some 3,300 vehicles have been torched since the rioting began. Schools, nurseries, shops, post offices and police stations have also been attacked. Police uncovered a gasoline bomb-making factory in a derelict building in the south of Paris. Of course, the Australian government strongly condemn these acts of violence and the needless and wanton destruction of property that has accompanied it. We welcome the statement by the French government expressing its resolve to restore law and order.Given the continuing violence - we do not know how long this will go on for; we hope it does not go for an hour longer - and the spread beyond localised areas of most regions of France, today the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reissued our travel advice for France. The travel advice urges Australians in France to monitor the media closely and to exercise a high degree of caution should they need to travel through areas which are affected in any way by the riots. We would urge any Australians in France, or those who are planning to visit France, to consult the travel advisory.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I point out to him that the GP bulk-billing rate in his area has increased by 13.7 per cent over the last 12 months, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. Today I inform him of more good news from the Howard government. From next year, the government will offer a new rural undergraduate allied health scholarship. This means that students from country areas studying subjects like dentistry, physiotherapy, psychology, occupational therapy, speech pathology and so on will have access to this new scholarship. There will be up to 180 scholarships a year. They will be worth $10,000 a year. Over time, this should certainly help to improve health services in country areas because, if you come from the country, you are more likely to stay in the country and practise in the country. This new scholarship complements the government's existing allied health postgraduate scholarships, and also supplements the government's allied health professional measure, announced as part of the Strengthening Medicare policy.The government have a good record of delivering better health services in country areas, thanks to measures such as the rural incentive payments, the practice nurse incentive payments and the establishment of rural clinical schools. The number of doctors in country areas has increased by 20 per cent since 1996. Measures like this show that, when it comes to health, the Howard government are the best friend that Medicare has ever had, and certainly we are the best friend that rural health services have ever had. - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway. I know that she is particularly proud of the fact that, under the Howard government, unemployment has dropped from 8.8 per cent to 4.7 per cent. It is a wonderful result of the work that we have been doing in employment programs and helping people off welfare and into work. I am proud to announce today that figures released in relation to Work for the Dole showed that, for around 85 per cent of job participants in Work for the Dole, it had increased their desire to find a job and it had increased their self-esteem, and they were satisfied with their involvement in the project. We know that Work for the Dole is a program that works. It is a program that provides people with an opportunity to contribute back to society. It is a program which supports young people working in a team environment and, for all of those reasons, we still cannot understand why the Labor Party continue to hate Work for the Dole.We know that the Labor Party would wind back Work for the Dole, despite the fact that it is an incredibly successful program. It is a program that enjoys tremendous support in the electorate, but the reality is that the Labor Party still cannot bring themselves to support this wonderful program. We know that, since 1997, on 336 occasions the Labor Party have taken the opportunity to talk down Work for the Dole. This is a great opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to show some leadership, to support Work for the Dole and to help young people off the dole and into work.</DOC>

I said to my department quite some time ago that I wanted them to cooperate fully, to pass all documents they could possibly find to the Volcker inquiry and to ensure that our mission in New York and our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra fully cooperated with the Volcker inquiry. The Volcker inquiry has drawn its conclusions, in particular, from our point of view as Australians, in relation to the Australian Wheat Board, and they can be read by honourable members.

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. The member for Ryan knows how important local government is to his constituents and to the communities around Australia. It is appropriate that he asks that question today, as the National General Assembly of Local Government is being held right here in Canberra this week. The Australian government strongly supports local government throughout Australia in many ways with the financial assistance grants, which are distributed to some 703 councils around Australia. That is $1.6 billion each year going directly to councils around Australia. Since we came to office in 1996 there has been a 39 per cent increase for roads and general purpose grants assisting local governments in Australia.In addition, we have introduced the Roads to Recovery funding. In the first round of the Roads to Recovery funding we provided $1.2 billion directly to local councils, and in the new four-year funding round we have provided some $1.35 billion, going directly to councils for local roads to improve roads in local communities. We provide some $45 million for blackspot funding around Australia which assists local government. In addition, we are currently looking at the 18 recommendations of the Hawker report, and we have responded to that. Some of the resolutions we are looking at in relation to the Hawker report are the implementation of the intergovernmental agreement to address the issue of cost shifting. Cost shifting, particularly from the state Labor governments, costs local councils in the vicinity of $500 million to $1 billion a year, and those sitting opposite should encourage the state Labor governments to look at how they can assist local government instead of tearing money out of local councils and local communities.</DOC>

 - I have done a little research since the Leader of the Opposition started asking me questions, and my research tells me that somewhere in the order of 700 to 800 questions have been asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition. I would hazard a guess that you would have to go back to Calwell questioning Menzies to find a situation where a leader of the opposition has had as many opportunities to ask a prime minister questions. I have been handed a note - miraculously a note has materialised. I have been told that 741 questions out of the 2,685 that have been asked of me since I have been the Prime Minister have come from the Leader of the Opposition. As I said the other day, my predecessor deigned to turn up half the number of times he should have. You have to go back to his predecessor to find a prime minister who turned up at every question time, and then they only allowed 45 minutes. I do not think any prime minister has been more available for questioning and debate in this parliament than the current one. I can promise the Leader of the Opposition that that is how it will remain.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I know that the member for La Trobe, given his previous experience, has been very interested in these issues and the way in which they evolve. Sixteen people have been arrested this morning -  - As I was saying a moment ago, 16 people have been arrested this morning in Melbourne and in Sydney in connection with terrorism related activities. As both the New South Wales and Victorian police commissioners have stated, this is an ongoing operation and further charges are being considered. For those reasons I have no intention of commenting in detail on the charges or the further conduct of the proceedings. It would be quite improper of me to do so. - You are absolutely right. I do regret that the events culminated in a shooting this morning. While the use of force by police officers is a matter of last resort, it is obviously always traumatic for the victim, their family, their friends and the police officers involved in the incident. This was an operation led by the Australian Federal Police and ASIO. I would like to also acknowledge the Victoria Police, the New South Wales Police and the New South Wales Crime Commission for their cooperation in disrupting these activities. The people arrested in Sydney and Melbourne are expected to face charges under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act of 1995. As Victorian Police Commissioner, Christine Nixon, stated this morning:We believe that they were planning an operation and we weren't exactly sure when, nor more importantly, what they planned to damage or to do harm to.Obviously, the role of the government is to ensure that appropriate laws are in place to support operational decisions. In this case, last week the parliament agreed to a specific provision to clarify that in a prosecution for a terrorist offence it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act. I would like to extend my appreciation to the parliament for dealing with those urgent amendments, especially to the senators who travelled long distances at short notice to ensure their passage. We should be comforted by the words of the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Ken Moroney, who said this morning:Certainly the Commonwealth legislation, as it passed last week, assisted us.His sentiments were echoed by state leaders in Victoria and New South Wales. Law enforcement and security agencies at the federal and state levels have worked together professionally, and I am sure the House would want to acknowledge their efforts.</DOC>

 - Under the current Workplace Relations Act there are protections for the privacy of individuals who have entered into Australian workplace agreements. Those protections provide that an official of the Office of the Employment Advocate should not disclose inappropriately details of information provided to the Office of the Employment Advocate. That is something which this government believes is entirely appropriate. It is just as appropriate as an official of a court not being at risk when in a position where he or she should disclose private information which is provided to them but which is not in the public domain. That is a sensible provision in the legislation at present. In addition to that -  - I thought the Leader of the Opposition was seeking information and asking a sensible question. -  - You might listen to the answer. If information which is private and which we believe ought to remain private is inappropriately disclosed by an official of the Office of the Employment Advocate to another person, then we think that those provisions would apply as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. Can I say on behalf of the House that it is great to have him back and for him to look so well. The National Australia Bank monthly business survey for October showed that business conditions weakened. Key activity and confidence measures weakened, although they remain at reasonable levels. Capacity utilisation declined, although it remains high by historical standards. Investment spending remained steady, but export performance was the best for some time. Business reported some improvement in job gains in October.Yesterday the ANZ job ads index was released. The ANZ head of economics, Tony Pearson, in commenting on that index said that he thought there would be a further slowing of employment over the next six months, but beyond this the upturn in newspaper advertisements is signalling a resurgence in demand for labour. He said:While it is early days yet, if the trend continues it points to some recovery in employment growth from mid-2006.That is consistent with an economy which is moderating somewhat at the moment. We have had extraordinary jobs growth during last year. As the House is aware, unemployment is at a 30-year low. We are seeing a rebalancing of the economy out of consumer demand towards business investment.I believe this is an opportunity to get on with further reform of the Australian economy. There is no more important microeconomic reform that we could do at the moment than industrial relations reform, which is absolutely critical for lifting productivity and capacity. Also, improvements to the welfare system, which will boost labour supply and encourage greater capacity, are very important for Australia's economic future. Overall, we have a very solid story to tell with solid prospects, but there is no room for complacency. The reform program must go on, and it must go on most particularly in industrial relations.</DOC>

 - This legislation is not extreme legislation. The position in relation to penalty rates has been very clearly set out both in statements that have been made and in the legislation. If somebody is on an award, the matters of penalty rates and leave loadings are covered in the award. If somebody enters into an agreement, unless there is provision in the agreement expressly varying or removing the penalty rates, the default provision is that the penalty rates stipulated in the relevant award obtain. That is the position; it is very clear. It is not as described by the member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I can inform him and the House that agreement has been reached on the fundamental design of a fourth agreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Commonwealth government. This agreement will be reasonable for pharmacists, it will be good for patients and, above all else, it will be fair for taxpayers. Over the life of the agreement, total payments to pharmacists will increase by 28 per cent in real terms and there will be a 6.2 per cent real increase in payments per script to pharmacists, but there will also be $350 million of savings against the forward estimates. There will be a new community service obligation fund, which will ensure that any PBS drug will be delivered to any pharmacy anywhere in Australia generally within 24 hours, and there will be more flexible location rules which will preserve traditional community pharmacy but which will also enable pharmacists to move to areas of high potential unmet demand for PBS drugs.This agreement is the product of more than six months of hard work by senior officials of my department and by officers of the Pharmacy Guild. I want to say that the guild has been a decent and honourable negotiating partner. Of course, it is in the nature of these agreements that there have been compromises all round, but this agreement demonstrates the capacity of the Howard government to engage in constructive partnership with important community organisations to produce agreements which are in the overall best interests of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question of substance in relation to workplace relations. I say to him that the new Work Choices system is the first step towards consolidating six state systems, which currently have over 3,000 pages of legislation, into a single workplace relations system for Australia. The achievement of this will be to the greater benefit of the Australian economy, reducing the needless red tape that has built up over 100 years in this country. This is something which this side of politics believe is important for Australia as we move into this century. Last week the Leader of the Opposition was reported on the Today show as saying:... we oppose every line of this Bill. And we will go to the next election on the basis of dismantling the system they put up ...The Leader of the Opposition also said:... Labor in government is committed to ripping up these laws.The R word rolls up. It reminds me of that other thing that he was going to do - roll back. It is rip up this time. But let us look at what he says he is going to rip up. This is what the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to rip up: he is going to rip up, he is going to roll back, one set of rules for workplaces in Australia. He does not want one set of rules for workplaces in Australia. -  - What the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to rip up, what he is going to get to vote for or against this week, is whether there should be one guaranteed safety net for workers in Australia, whether or not they are covered by an award. That is what he says he is going to rip up. He is also going to rip up a guaranteed four weeks annual leave for workers in Australia. That is what the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to rip up. And it goes on. The Leader of the Opposition says he is going to rip up every single page. That means he is going to rip up a guarantee of a minimum of 52 weeks maternity leave. That is what he is going to rip up. I suppose he is also going to vote against doubling the number of workplace inspectors in Australia. Is he against doubling the number of workplace inspectors in Australia? Or what about protecting small business who are ruined by irresponsible industrial action? That is what the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to vote against, and the list goes on and on and on.All of these sensible measures that are there to protect employers and employees in Australia, the Leader of the Opposition says that he stands against. The reality, of course, is that nobody knows what he stands for and nobody knows what he stands against. In fact, I remind the House that he said for two terms of parliament he was against the GST and he was going to roll it back. Is he still against it today? Not even the union movement believe the Leader of the Opposition, because reported in the West Australian on Monday the Secretary of UnionsWA, Dave Robinson, is reported as 'urging union supporters not to become complacent by relying on the Labor Party to roll back the legislation'. The unionists in Western Australia, who know the Leader of the Opposition well, know we do not know what he is for and we do not know what he is against. The sad feature of a man who has spent 25 years in this place is that most Australians have not got a clue what you stand for.</DOC>

 - I do not without checking - and I am not necessarily suggesting that the member for Wills is misleading the parliament; I am not suggesting that - find myself in a position to confirm the identity of the distribution company. I am aware of Salmat. I do not know whether Salmat has contributed to other political parties. It would be my understanding - and I will check this - that the contract was awarded in the normal fashion. It has not been the practice in the past to disbar companies from doing government work simply by reason of the fact that they have made political donations. I will ask somebody to just do a little bit of research this afternoon as to the donation and political track record of organisations and individuals that have enjoyed government contracts under former governments.I thought the rule was that you awarded these contracts in a manner where there was a proper selection, and the fact that the company may have been a financial supporter of this or that side of politics was totally irrelevant. But apparently the Labor Party no longer believes that, which is a very interesting observation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and can I take the opportunity to thank him and all members on this side of the House for the consultation that they have provided to the government in the formulation of our Welfare to Work package. Earlier today Minister Andrews and I had the pleasure of announcing details of the Howard government's $3.6 billion investment in the Welfare to Work package to help more job seekers and their families get ahead by getting off welfare and into work.The changes to be introduced will see around 450,000 new employment training and rehabilitation places to help people with disabilities, parents, the mature aged and very long-term unemployed off the dole and into work. This also importantly includes an additional 101,000 places in employment and rehabilitation services. In the Job Network, for instance, there will be a new employment preparation service to help parents update or gain new skills to help them get into work. There will be additional places for parents with additional needs in the Personal Support Program and other specialist employment services. For people with disabilities who have a capacity to work, there are more services and there is more financial incentive to help them into part-time and ultimately, we hope, full-time employment.I can confirm today that parents applying for parenting payment single after 1 July 2006 will be able to remain on that payment until their youngest child turns eight. However, they will still have to look for work once the youngest child turns six. Parents currently on the parenting payment single will remain on that payment until their youngest child turns 16. An important point to make - because the Labor Party have been running a scare campaign on this very issue - is that people who were on a disability support pension at the time that this announcement was made, at the May budget, will remain on that pension. These changes we are very proud of because they are in the national interest. - We know that they will bring more Australians the ability to get into a job and to enjoy the financial rewards that a job brings. This government strongly believes, in contrast to the Labor Party, that people of a working age who have a capacity to work are better off off welfare and into work -  - not just better for themselves but better for their families and their children and, ultimately, better for this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, which is obviously very relevant to the sugar industry Australia-wide and particularly the sugar producers in his electorate. The federal government is working hard on a number of fronts to assist the sugar industry and cane growers across Australia in trade opportunities internationally, in the structure of the industry in Australia and in new opportunities to use their product in different ways domestically in Australia. The member would be aware that Australia took part in a joint action with Brazil and Thailand in the WTO, in which we challenged the subsidies that the European Union applied to five million tonnes of its sugar that it was exporting. We argued that case and won. We won on the basis that those subsidies were found to be illegal, and they have to be removed. The member will be pleased to hear that, by 22 May next year, the European Union will have to reduce those subsidies to only 1¼ million tonnes of sugar instead of five million tonnes of sugar. That will mean Australia's sugar producers will be able to compete more effectively and competitively and without that distortion in the international marketplace. That is something we have undertaken under the rules based system of the WTO.I can also confirm that the government have been undertaking additional measures by providing new opportunities for the use of sugar cane and sugar in Australia. That, of course, is through the development of a sustainable and competitive Australian ethanol industry. Unlike those on the other side, who a few years ago stymied the development of an ethanol industry in Australia for political purposes, this government have put in place a number of measures to assist in the development of an ethanol industry which will use sugar as the biomass going into its development. We have introduced a $37 million program to expand the capacity of the biofuels industry, $43 million in ethanol production grants and an effective excise-free status until 2011, all to help generate the development of this new industry in Australia which underpins not just the sugar industry but also other agricultural industries in Australia.We have worked with the fuel distribution industry and it has committed to developing industry action plans to implement the distribution of biofuels throughout Australia. Australia's four car manufacturers have agreed that, as of the beginning of next year, they will fix labels to all new vehicles, authorising usage and guaranteeing the warranty on those vehicles to use E10 fuel, a 10 per cent ethanol blend. So there has been a broad range of contributions by a number of industries in Australia to assist in the development of the ethanol industry.Last week the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Ian Macfarlane, and I launched the availability of an E10 blend through a local BP service station here in Canberra. So all members of parliament can go down to Kingston and fill up with E10 and support the Australian sugar industry. I am delighted to inform the House that since then we have been advised that ethanol blended fuel makes up about 25 per cent of the regular unleaded fuel sales at that particular participating BP store in Kingston. So the member for Hinkler should be comfortable in the knowledge that our government is working on many fronts to support the sugar industry in Australia.</DOC>

 - From work which has been done in the IMF, the OECD and other international organisations, one of the reasons why unemployment rates are lower in Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Australia at present is that by and large those countries have more flexible labour markets than countries on the continent, particularly France and Germany. Those members of the public who have been following recent events in France will know that France has a very high unemployment rate - higher than 10 per cent - as does Germany. One of the reasons why unemployment is so high in France is they have a very highly regulated labour market, including a labour market which has very restrictive unfair dismissal laws. I was on the IMF committee for eight or nine years and I do not think there was a single meeting of the IMF committee that passed without the continental countries being urged to reform their labour markets -  - and to get rid of restrictive unfair dismissal laws in order to boost productivity and to lower unemployment. - As I said on that program yesterday, and was quoted, you can compare countries that have regulated labour markets against those that do not. Those that do, such as France and Germany and others in continental Europe, invariably have higher unemployment. The New Zealand unemployment rate, from memory, is probably lower than Australia's. - Okay, the Leader of the Opposition says it is higher. We will go to the record but I will make a prediction. My recollection is that it is in fact lower, but I will make this prediction: it will certainly not be in double digits as in countries like France and Germany. Why? Because New Zealand - like Australia, like the United States and like Britain, the so-called Anglo societies - has a much less regulated labour market and - </DOC>

 - First I thank the honourable member for his question and remind the House that, as the Prime Minister has said so often, the government's top priority is to protect the safety and welfare of Australians here in Australia and of course we do what we can overseas. The House may be interested to know that Australians are now making 4.8 million trips every year and almost 900,000 Australians live overseas. It is therefore not surprising that the government's travel advisory has become an important tool for communicating with Australian travellers. Today I have announced that the DFAT travel advisory system will be changed to make it clearer and simpler for Australians to use. The changes include the creation of a new five-level advisory system, which grades the government's assessment of the level of risk in individual countries. The system ranges from level 1, which advises travellers to be alert to their own security, to the highest level, which recommends, not surprisingly, that Australians should not travel to a country.Let me make it absolutely clear: it is not the job of the government to tell Australians what to do. We on this side of the House do not aspire to run a nanny state. Decisions about whether, where and when to travel are up to individuals. - Our old friends, the socialists, of course aspire to run the state just like that. That is why you join the Labor Party: so that you can tell other people what to do with their lives. - The changes will help Australians to better understand the relative level of risks in the different countries and therefore to make well-informed decisions about overseas travel. -  - Mr Speaker, I happen to think that the people watching question time are quite interested in the travel advisory system, even if the old Labor Party are not. The Labor Party of yesteryear might have been; the Labor Party of today are just a party, as you can see from their badges, of trade union hacks. There are three simple steps that all travellers can take to make sure they are prepared for unexpected events overseas. The first is to subscribe to the travel advisory service. The second is to register their contact details with the smart travel web site so that consular staff can contact them in an emergency. The third is to take out travel insurance. I do think that it is a very important thing for Australians to do. At the end of the day, it is up to individuals to weigh the risks and to take responsibility for their own decisions and actions. The government will do what it can to help but, in the end, individuals must take responsibility for their own decisions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. Isn't it great to have a member for Bass who actually takes things like aviation security seriously instead of a union inspired, scaremongering campaign, which is all we receive from the other side? They do not understand security. They have never tried to. At the last election they made no significant commitments to security -  - All they do is criticise. There are never any real, constructive contributions made to effectively deal with security. - It is indeed a serious question. I would have thought, therefore, that the members opposite might have listened and wanted to get a few facts about what is actually happening. The reality is that the new Aviation Transport Security Act, which was put in place in March this year, has provided a framework for us to be involved in a very significant investment in new aviation security activity. Since March, 250 Australian airports and airlines have developed detailed security programs and are required to follow appropriate security procedures. There has been a constructive response from airports around Australia to their obligations in that regard - most opposite to the attitude being shown by members opposite now and in their contributions to this issue.The government, in its response to the Wheeler recommendations, has put in place programs which will also add very substantially to the safety of people operating and needing to use our Australian airports. The counter-terrorism measures that have been proposed include new offences for leaving baggage unattended in airport precincts and greater powers for police, particularly in transport hubs and other places of mass gathering. - Since September 11, the Australian government has put in place measures totalling around $500 million to improve aviation security. There is $195 million specifically in response to the Wheeler recommendations and, in addition to that, there was $93 million for the enhanced aviation security package in December 2003. There are significant investments for regional security.I noticed the shadow minister for transport interjecting. He was making some critical comments about the roll-out of wands and security equipment for the first time at regional airports around Australia. This program will be completed ahead of schedule so that, at those airports where the risks are assessed as being lower than at capital city airports, there will be a capacity to deal with heightened threats whenever they arise. This is a government that is serious about security and serious about addressing the needs of our capital city and regional airports. We are getting on with the job. Members opposite merely criticise with union inspired scare campaigns which do not address the issues because they have no commitment to security or to spending the resources necessary to keep our skies safe.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. He, like all of us who are parents, would know that, apart from we who are parents, the most important people in the lives of our children are their teachers. So Australians would have been quite disturbed today when they read on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald a headline which said, 'Teachers told: prove you can read and write'. In fact, the story reports on a national inquiry that I commissioned a year ago into the teaching of reading in Australian schools and how Australian teachers are taught how to teach our children to read. The Sydney Morning Herald today said that this report that I am about to receive is 'scathing about the competence of student teachers, citing evidence that many lack 'the literacy skill required to be effective teachers of reading''. Annah Healy, the coordinator of literacy in primary education at the Queensland University of Technology, in the same article said:Years ago we could give students literacy tests to work out where they stood, but we can't now because of all these equity guidelines. We can't be seen to be discriminating. But we'd love to do it again.The article went on:Dr Healy estimated 20 per cent of her students had serious literacy problems and another 10 per cent 'just got it'.This report follows a growing and substantial body of evidence that there is a serious problem in the training of Australia's teachers. That is not a criticism of teachers, but it is a criticism of the way in which they are being trained. No teacher can teach what he or she has not been taught to do. We know that, at the moment, one in 10 people training to be a teacher at the University of Tasmania is undergoing a remedial reading program. We know that only one in six students at the Australian Defence Force Academy, who need to have very high entry scores to get in, can achieve a 70 per cent proficiency in basic grammar. We know that 56 per cent of those training to be teachers, in a study at the Queensland University of Technology, could not identify a syllable. As Dr Healy said in today's Sydney Morning Herald article, 'How on earth would they cope if they ever had to help a child with language difficulties?'The battle for Australia's international competitiveness is going to be fought, and indeed won or lost, in Australia's schools. We know that about 30 per cent of Australian children are leaving the school system today functionally illiterate. The government are determined to see that there will be reforms in Australian universities, particularly in education faculties. We have established, at a cost of $30 million, a national institute for quality teaching to oversee this process. By the time this government have finished with teacher training, those who go into training to be teachers not only will be tested on literacy and numeracy but will be tested on the way out. Our children need it and our country's future relies on it.</DOC>

He advised the Senate that he and his authority have discharged their statutory responsibilities as required under the legislation. I should also stress that the Australian Wheat Board has continued to deny it had any knowledge that it was paying or entering into an agreement to pay money to the former Iraqi regime and that it followed the processes and protocols laid down by the United Nations. The honourable member will not need reminding that the Prime Minister has announced that there will be an independent inquiry to examine whether there has been any breach of Australian law by those Australian companies referred to in the Volcker report.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I pay tribute to the member for Forde who, in her time in this parliament, has been so strong on advocacy for family policy and opportunities for the next generation. All sides of this place greatly respect and appreciate her efforts. The Australian government are continuing to roll out on our election commitments. This side of politics promise and deliver. That is what we do, and we are in the process of providing additional support to new apprentices. We are providing young people in this country with real choices. Those opposite do not like the word 'choice'. They like to show that they do not trust young people; they prefer to tell them what they have to do, or there will be no government assistance. But on this side we believe that young people can be trusted to pursue the type of career that they want.This has led to the introduction of a number of measures, including the $1,000 Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship - paid in two parts - for first- and second-year apprentices, at a cost of $106 million over four years. Recently, MAS Administrative Services was the organisation selected to manage the delivery of another government initiative: the Tools for Your Trade initiative. More than $120 million has been allocated over four years. It will assist some 34,000 new apprentices each year over the next four years, with an $800 tool kit in trade shortage professions, which will make a real difference. The kits have been available since 1 October.Over 10,744 new apprentices who commenced after 1 July this year are now potentially able to receive that $800 tool kit. For the information of the member for Forde, that includes 259 apprentices in her electorate alone. We are determined to continue to promote the government's policies in assisting employers and new apprentices to get on with the job of creating the next generation of trained people. We are determined to back young Australians.I listened to what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said before. He said, 'Not even the union movement believe what the Labor Party say, because I've gone to the ACTU web site and, as they say, when it comes to new apprenticeships, you now have a lot more choice.' They have actually listed the full range of professions, including the ones that the Labor Party targeted, such as hospitality, tourism, health care, child care and retail. The ACTU are happy to endorse this government's support for the choice that young people make, while those opposite continue to be isolated in the reality that comforts them but no-one else in this nation.</DOC>

I remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is nine years and eight months since this government was elected to office. It is nine years and eight months since the Prime Minister of this country resumed the correct democratic process of being answerable to the parliament every day, unlike my predecessor, whom the Leader of the Opposition served as Leader of the House.

 - I thank the member for Herbert for the question. As the House will be aware, the earthquake that hit Pakistan on 8 October has represented an enormous humanitarian disaster. It has killed about 86,000 people and injured some 70,000, and more than three million people are homeless. The House will be aware of assistance that the government has already announced, which I will return to in a moment. But I can inform the House that recent urgent calls, by the Pakistan government, international relief agencies and the United Nations, have been made to provide further assistance in view of the onset of harsh winter conditions and the worsening humanitarian crisis.In response to these appeals I am pleased to announce that the government has decided to send to Pakistan an Australian Defence Force medical team. This team will provide vital primary health care services in the earthquake zone around Muzaffarabad. It will consist of approximately 140 personnel, including medical specialists, logistic staff and helicopter and support personnel. This follows the dispatch of a reconnaissance mission last week which began planning for this deployment. The Pakistan government has already welcomed our decision. The medical team will leave for Pakistan by the end of the week. It is anticipated that it will be in Pakistan for approximately 90 days. The cost is in the order of $18 million to $20 million. This assistance is on top of the amount of $14.6 million in earthquake related assistance, which the Australian government has already provided.The Australian government has also sent to affected areas blankets, sleeping bags, water purification tablets and medicines, including tetanus vaccines. I know that all Australians will wish the ADF medical team well. It will be providing very important humanitarian on-the-ground assistance to the people who have suffered so much. During the severe winter months it will make a significant contribution to relieving the suffering of the people of Pakistan affected by the earthquake. I wish the mission well. I know it will go with the support and good wishes of all Australians.</DOC>

 - Can I have your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to begin by saying that I support the initiative of the government in relation to the aid to Pakistan. They are clearly in desperate straits, and they deserve the support of all nations of goodwill, particularly those of reasonable wealth and standing like us.But that same support obviously does not extend to the extreme laws that this government is bringing in without proper debate in this place, without real debate and real scrutiny and without any sort of mandate at all. It may be the case that the Prime Minister has talked about these things for 20 years, but he did not talk about them in the last election campaign when these issues, like all great issues of the day, were debated before the Australian people. There is a simple solution to that, and it would be done in any other country: he should be prepared to front the people of this nation and explain what it is that he intends for them.There is another reason why this ought to take place. I was at Canberra Hospital this morning talking to the women - mainly women - who are on the nursing staff and the hospital support staff, doing an absolutely tremendous job. They wanted to know why their hard work in the community was going to be rewarded by the undermining of their shift allowances, the undermining of the penalty rates. 'Does this government,' they said, 'have any understanding of the difficulties that are experienced by balancing work and family in the work force as it now stands?' They wanted an explanation, because they were all, to a woman, emphatic that they had not had it during the course of the last election campaign.What we have had is $50 million worth of saccharine advertising from our political opponents, more than was spent in the entirety of the last federal election, spreading simple deceits about the policy that is coming into place. We have had 1,200 pages worth of this extreme legislation and a parliamentary guillotine killing off the debate, and there are six million misleading pamphlets of spin, most of them sitting in a warehouse now. I am told that those six million pamphlets are not aid for a debate; they are for seminars. I ask you! Let us say we distribute 20 of those pamphlets per seminar. That means you can all look forward, over the course of the next two years, to 300,000 seminars around Australia where these pamphlets will be delivered to you.Can't you just see it in the highways and byways of our country towns? 'The big top's coming to town, Daddy. Take us down to the circus.' They will get down to that circus and there daddy will learn about how he is going to be easily sacked, and mummy will learn about how she will no longer have family-friendly hours as she looks after her children, and the children will learn what a rotten time they will have when they go to negotiate their first lot of pay. - I say to my friend from Paterson: we all learn by example. We absolutely know who the clowns will be at this seminar. We will have the Leader of the House there with a red nose and a funny hat on as he dances around before the public of this country, continuing with them, face to face, the misleading that he does, but we will not see the Prime Minister. He will not get out there and debate this before the Australian people, either on his own or with me. It is something that the democracy of this nation demands. So the government ought to back off this, because the Australian people are sending them a clear-cut message. -  - They do not want accountants to do their bargaining for them. They do not want to compete with China and India on wages. - The nurses I met today, all Australian workers, were making it clear. They wanted a continuation of their rights and conditions, Aussie style. - They want to take our kids to cricket and netball on a Saturday morning. They want to be upskilled, not underpaid. They want a fair go, fair dinkum, fair pay. That is what they want. They want an industrial relations system with a fair umpire to make sure they get it. That is exactly what is demanded by the Australian workers.I will tell you what we are going to do with this bill. We cannot get a debate in this place, but we are going to debate this with the other side of the House all down the next two years. What we will be saying to the Australian people is that, as far as we are concerned, when we get into office we are going to take this bill, and we know exactly where to put it: right in the bin here.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I think we would all agree that the Attorney-General is doing an outstanding job with the new terrorism legislation. This legislation, of course, is essential in order to provide appropriate protections for the Australian people. Whilst there understandably is debate about these issues in our own country, it is worth people understanding that these issues are being addressed in a very robust way in what you might broadly describe as other like-minded countries.In the United Kingdom, for example, the detention of terrorist suspects without charge can be extended to 14 days under the Terrorism Act 2000. It is also worth noting that the admittedly rather controversial but recently introduced Terrorism Bill 2005 seeks to increase that period of detention without charges to up to three months.In the United States, noncitizens may be detained indefinitely if the Attorney-General has reasonable grounds to believe that they are a danger to national security, and detention is subject to renewal every six months. The United States also sought to invoke their witness provisions in relation to suspected terrorists. These provisions allow for the arrest and detention of persons whose testimony is material in criminal proceedings where it is shown it is impractical to secure their presence by subpoena. There is no requirement in the United States that the person be charged with a criminal offence, and release of the material witness may be delayed for a reasonable period until their deposition can be taken.In France the system provides for terrorist suspects to be detained for up to four days and, once a person has been charged, it allows for pre-trial investigative detention for up to three years. The charge of criminal association relating to a terrorist enterprise is also frequently used to justify holding suspects for extended periods of preventative detention.These types of measures have been introduced in other somewhat like-minded countries, countries with great traditions of freedom of speech and expression and with a broad disposition towards freedom. There is no doubt that those countries realise they have to take decisive and strong action against terrorism, and we must do the same thing in this country - and we are doing the same thing in this country. The people of the countries that I have just referred to want their governments and their parliaments to provide appropriate protection, and in this country likewise the Australian people expect this parliament to provide appropriate protection to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I actually wanted to answer that. The answer to that is no. In relation to penalty rates and descriptions of the legislation, let me make two points. In relation to penalty rates the position is that, if an employee is covered by an award, that award provides penalty rates. If an employee is negotiating an agreement, unless the agreement expressly removes or modifies the penalty rates, the penalty rates applying in the relevant award will by default operate.The member for Perth inaccurately described this legislation as 'extreme'. It is not extreme legislation. The great problem that the member for Perth has - and it is very similar to the problem the Leader of the Opposition has - is that we have heard those descriptions before. I have done a little bit of research about what the Leader of the Opposition has said. Bear in mind that what the Leader of the Opposition is now defending is the present industrial relations system, which was legislated in 1996. That is what he is now defending. The Leader of the Opposition is defending the 1996 system. But let me remind the House of what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in 1996. I invite the House to listen, because these words, the words of the Leader of the Opposition, will sound very familiar. This is what he had to say:... the kind of low wage, low productivity industrial wasteland we see in the United States and New Zealand where jobs can be bought at bargain basement rates ... straight down the American road on industrial relations legislation, straight down the American road on wages justice, and that produces -  - The quote continues:... and that produces social dislocation more than anything else.At the end of the day, guns are a symptom of that process. - He went on to say:At the end of the day, guns are a symptom of that process.The then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, had this to say:The social costs of implementing these measures will have a devastating effect on families in Australia ... Thousands upon thousands of Australian workers have sweated blood to achieve conditions -  - The quote continues:... that allow parents to have time with their kids, to have decent holidays, to have income security, to have leave to look after their children and to have weekends and recreation time.The Leader of the Opposition forecast doom and disaster in 1996. Nine and a half years later we have the lowest unemployment in 30 years, unparalleled prosperity, great productivity increases and a situation where we have -  - The Australian people are better off than they were under you.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question, because there has been a very significant response to yesterday's events from various sections of the Australian community. One of the areas that has been obvious has been the community's desire to assist authorities in relation to their investigations. This has been reflected in the number of calls to the national security hotline. After yesterday's police and security operations, the number of calls to the hotline doubled to 240. Normally, about half of the calls to the hotline are from people seeking to provide information to the authorities but, significantly, yesterday close to 80 per cent were to provide information about suspicious activities and this trend is continuing. Importantly, I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that a preliminary assessment suggests that a significant number of calls provided very useful information. Of course, if only one of these calls provides information that prevents a terrorist attack, the hotline will have been justified.But there are also some concerns that operations in which the police and security agencies were engaged have targeted in some way particular parts of our Australian community. I want to make this point very clearly. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, terrorism is everybody's enemy. Yesterday's events were not targeted at the Muslim community; they were targeted at people who were alleged to have been involved in the commission of a criminal act. I want to make it very clear that the Muslim community has made a very important contribution to the development of this nation. We should remember that a large number of Muslims themselves have been victims of terrorist attacks around the world. This government will continue to work with the Muslim community against those who pervert their religion to justify their deadly intentions.Finally, I encourage anyone in the community who has relevant information to bear in mind that the hotline is available. The national security hotline 1800 number is very easy to remember; it is 1800 123400.</DOC>

I remember that we had an unemployment level of around a million. I seem to remember that the current Leader of the Opposition was in charge of employment matters at the time. - I remember a great deal about December 1992. - If the member for Perth wants to debate Labor's past, we will be delighted to accommodate him. - I say more specifically to the member for Perth: I am very familiar with the provisions of that policy, which I took to the Australian people again.

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Today the Westpac Melbourne Institute released its consumer sentiment survey, which showed that, in the month just past, consumer sentiment rose by nine per cent. That was a strong bounce back from the large fall in September. It bounced back to be above the average - the 100 mark - at 107.6 in November. Probably the main reason for the bounce back in consumer sentiment was the belief that petrol prices have at least stabilised. Also, there was good news overnight that the world oil price has dipped just marginally below $US60 a barrel, which I think will be received as good news by Australian consumers.Mr Speaker, bear in mind that, in the September quarter, the all capital average for the petrol price was around 119c; last week it was at 118.4c. If prices remain around these levels, there should be no contribution to the consumer price index for the December quarter from an increase in petrol prices. Of course, we hope that petrol prices decline in the course of the quarter and, indeed, that oil prices stay low. We know they will vary according to climatic conditions, in North America in particular as it comes through the northern winter, but we do hope that oil prices will come back.We also have housing finance figures released today, which show that the total value of housing finance commitments rose by 3.2 per cent in September and owner-occupied commitments increased by 3.7 per cent. The figures today for housing finance also show more welcome good news: first home buyers are continuing to re-enter the housing market. The number of loans to first home buyers has been above the long-term average now for seven consecutive months. The number of first home buyers taking out loans was a little more than 10,000 in September. That is welcome news - first home buyers are returning to the market, house prices are stabilising and prospects for taking a loan are good, because employment is strong and interest rates are still at near historical lows. For all of those first home buyers that are now coming into the market, there is a variable mortgage interest rate closer to seven per cent than 17 per cent, which was the situation back in the late-1980s under the Labor Party. - Dare I raise for the member for Melbourne where the Labor Party had interest rates in the late 1980s. I am sure he will remind me where they were. I think it was not so close to seven per cent but closer to 17 per cent for first home buyers in the late 1980s. Good economic management produces good opportunity for young Australian home buyers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and acknowledge his leadership of the backbench in his chairmanship of the government's employment and workplace relations committee. Australian businesses, particularly small businesses, know that these workplace relations reforms will be good for business and good for their staff. There has been widespread support from business organisations in Australia - the Business Council of Australia, which represents the top 200 companies in this country; the ACCI, which represents a large cross-section of over 350,000 businesses in this country representing four million employees; the National Farmers Federation, which represents the farmers of Australia; and COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. All these business organisations have supported these reforms. Last night on SBS, Tony Steven, the CEO of COSBOA, said:I believe that small businesses will employ more people.There is support from workers themselves. Sandra Xuereb, who was shown on the front page of the Australian newspaper - a single mother with a couple of kids - was lauding her ability to be able to work with flexibility in her business and also to look after her family. She was quoted in the Australian as saying about this flexibility that she can leave in the middle of the day and do what she has to do; it is really good having that option, being a single mother. Here is a worker saying that this flexibility is good; it is not just for businesses. - We have seen from the opposition over the last few weeks an unbelievable amount of hostility towards businesses in Australia. This is a party which has abandoned small businesses and is now vilifying the motives of small business in Australia. If we were to believe what the Leader of the Opposition was saying, then we would believe that every small business owner in Australia is going to run amok with this legislation and sack workers all over Australia. We have an anti small business rhetoric and an anti small business mentality coming from the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party.It is not just me saying this; it is not just the government saying this. This was said in May of this year:The Labor Party has given up the middle-class, middle-ground, sole-employer, self-employed, small-business voter ...Who said that? Was it John Howard? No, it was not John Howard -  - but he agrees. Was it the Treasurer? No, it was not the Treasurer. This was said in May of this year by Paul Keating. This highlights the hostility of the Australian Labor Party towards small business. - This was confirmed by the infamous lines of the Leader of the Opposition himself in 2000 when he said this:We have never pretended to be a small business Party, the Labor Party.He said, 'We have never pretended that.' That is what he said on 6PR radio in Perth back in 2000. There are 28,000 businesses in Kim Beazley's electorate - in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition. Yet he is running around this country, as is the Labor Party, vilifying every small business and every other business in this country. That is the reality of the attack by the Australian Labor Party. -  - What we are seeing here is an unprecedented extreme vilification of business in Australia by the Australian Labor Party, ranging from the small businesses - the milk bar on the corner - of the suburbs of Australia through to the CEOs of the blue-chip companies of this country. They are being vilified day in and day out by the Australian Labor Party. What this proves once again is that the Australian Labor Party is a party of sectional interests. It is about time it actually acted in the national interest.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question is no. The reality is that the greater flexibility provided by this legislation will enhance the way in which the government has already improved the balance between work and family in the Australian community.I am very pleased that the member for Sydney asked me that question. Just before question time I was looking over some notes for a speech that will be delivered in the next few days, talking about the record of this government in dealing with social security issues. I was reminded of a finding by the OECD that said that Australia had the most outstanding record of any developed country in redistributing in favour of low- and middle-income families. Every single investigation of repute that has been done - be it done by NATSEM or other reputable bodies -  - demonstrates that over the last 9½ years, contrary -  - to the nonsense peddled by the Australian Labor Party - and everything they have said in this debate is of a piece - that is the case. What they have said in this debate is a remorseless continuation of the way in which they have misrepresented the social record and the social achievement of this government.I know it sticks in the craw of the Australian Labor Party, but the truth is that over the last 9½ years the rich have not got richer at the expense of the poor getting poorer. The reality is that our policies - our tax policies, our welfare policies - have resulted in the relative position of the low-income families of Australia improving. We have not only been a better friend of the workers of Australia than previous Labor governments have; we have also been a better friend of the low-income earners of Australia. That is what sticks in the craw. Not only have we been a better friend of the workers but we have been a better friend of the low-income earners. The Labor Party finds that very hard to live with because it knows it is true.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question and recognise that he is a former member and minister of a government in Australia that undertook major reforms that improved the productivity and efficiency of the state of New South Wales. He recognises the importance of the reforms that are being proposed by this government to improve competitiveness and productivity in the Australian workplace.In the year ending last June, the 2004-05 financial year, Australia exported $162 billion worth of goods and services out of this country, with an increase in manufactured exports and right across the board - in the services sector, the commodity sector and manufactured goods. It is the highest level of exports in Australia's history. If we want to continue this export success and be competitive against all other comers across the world, we have to continue to increase productivity gains in Australia and improve the way the Australian economy runs. That goes to the heart of some of the reforms that are being proposed by our government now.This has been recognised by a number of international institutions. The IMF have urged the implementation of the government's industrial relations reforms to widen the employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements. The IMF's view is that further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labour demand and facilitate productivity gains - exactly the objective that the government has.Our reforms are also supported by the many businesses across Australia that employ millions of Australians in exporting industries. Just to give some examples: Australian Business Woman of the Year, Diana Williams, who started her health club business in Bendigo in regional Victoria, has her 3,000 staff on AWAs. She said:I think they are pretty happy with the arrangement, especially the maternity leave. Ninety-nine per cent of my staff are female and most are in child-bearing years. Even though the job market is tight, we have a lot of people wanting to work for us.Mr John Thorpe, the President of the Australian Hotels Association's New South Wales division, said:Australian workplace agreements are an excellent award alternative for the hospitality industry as they provide flexibility and fairness to an industry that never closes.He went on to say:The most important features are the ability for our members to provide flexible and permanent employment to employees who would otherwise be hired as casual staff. AWAs provide a win-win solution to addressing penalty rates and award inflexibilities to the satisfaction of employers and staff alike.The last one comes from Catalano Seafoods, who are market leaders in providing fresh seafood produce to export markets. Their human resource manager, Karen McCarthy, states:AWAs have helped increase our retention rates and offer the flexibility to meet our needs while also keeping our employees happy.They are testimonies from good employers who look after their staff, who look after employees on AWAs; as well as from the IMF, urging the implementation of these reforms in the Australian system to further enhance productivity and our competitiveness in the international marketplace.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Can I point out to her, though, that she has been sadly misinformed of the facts that she put into the question in relation to the payment that anyone will receive. - One of the great advantages of what this government is doing by way of reform of workplace relations in Australia is to put in place in legislation in Australia, for the first time at the federal level, a guaranteed minimum wage. The guaranteed minimum wage, the starting point, is the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission this year in its 2005 safety net review. That minimum wage is some $12.75 an hour, a long way from the $3 or $4 that the honourable member was quoting. I am not sure whether the honourable member had done the research herself or the Manager of Opposition Business just passed her the question, but the reality is that the matters that she set out in her question are basically wrong. If one looks at the situation of sole parents, this government unashamedly says to any person who is on welfare that the best form of welfare that we can provide, that we can encourage them to have, is a job. The best form of welfare is a job. - The best form of welfare is a job. The government is unashamed in its commitment to encouraging as many Australians who are capable of working to get a job. If one looks at the situation of a sole parent -  - A sole parent in receipt of the single parenting payment now has a weekly income of $433.13. Under these proposals that sole parent, not when the youngest child turns six but when the youngest child turns eight, will be encouraged to find a minimum of 15 hours work per week. At the minimum rate of $12.75 per hour, combined with the income support and the family tax benefit that that parent will still retain, that parent will have a weekly income of $487.81. So, instead of living on an income of $433.13, that parent will be in receipt of $487.81 - and that is at the minimum wage rate working the minimum of 15 hours.In addition to that, the sole parent will retain the pensioner concession card, will retain their telephone allowance and will retain their pharmaceutical allowance. These are important reforms -  - In effect, the opposition is arguing that Australia should accept that sole parents remain on welfare benefits, on average for 12 years, with the corresponding poverty that flows from that and the corresponding detriment that flows to their children. We have a different view and we are prepared to do something about it - unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who stands for nothing.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. He is a member who has very strongly supported the contribution Australia is making to the developing democracy in Iraq. The fourth rotation of the Australian Army Training Team in Iraq is in Al Muthanna province, in the south. So far they have trained around 900 members of the Iraqi Second Brigade of the 10th Division and have also provided some basic training for another 650 in Tallil. The third rotation of the training team in Iraq was in Taji, which is north of Baghdad. They trained around 1,000 Iraqis in logistics. I understand that was a huge success and that, through two advisers, it is still providing support to the Iraqi Army Services Support Institute.The first and second of the training teams that we sent have completed their tours, during which they trained the Fourth Brigade and Eighth Brigade of the Iraq Third Division. Australians should be proud of the simply outstanding job that the Australian Army, and Australian Defence Force generally, is doing in Iraq to train the Iraqis to take responsibility for security in that country. Our objective on this side of the House is perfectly clear: to see the continuation of the democratic process and, increasingly, the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to take control of security in their own country. When those jobs have been completed, the transformation of Iraq from a brutal and cruel dictatorship to a liberal democracy will be great news not just for the people of Iraq but for the Middle East. Through the Middle East there will be an emerging trend towards democracy, and that emerging trend will contribute to greater peace in that very troubled region.It is a simple point: we are very proud of the role - and it has been in controversial circumstances - that the government has played in helping to make this possible. It has held Australia in good stead around the world. To have adopted the position of the Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition more generally, would have meant simply to have allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in place, which would not have been in the best interests of the Iraqi people, the Middle East or Australia.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I will begin by agreeing with the honourable member that we are concerned about illegal fishing. This is certainly a growing problem, as the honourable member said. I cannot confirm precisely the statistics but it has been a problem for a very long time. It is an increasing problem, I am advised, because of the very high prices Indonesian fishermen are able to get for shark fins. It is the case that some of the owners of the fishing boats - by the way, they are not necessarily Indonesian - including in our territorial waters, are prepared to take risks.The honourable member makes a point about the dimensions and the number of patrol boats you might have to devote to an area so great. You could never provide enough patrol boats to cover every single possible incursion by any imaginable fishing boat. It would simply be impossible to do. It seems to us that by far the best approach is the approach that we are taking now, which is to ensure that the Indonesian government and the Indonesian fishing industry understand - and they are not just Indonesian fishermen - the risks, the dangers and the offences involved.We conducted two operations - Operation Clear Water 1 and 2 - in April and October this year, which focused on protecting our northern waters. Indonesian officers from the fisheries and customs ministries participated in the first of those operations, but they were not available to participate in the second. The government is also using options to securely and safely detain illegal foreign fishermen, including - but not exclusively - Indonesians. Further work is going on with refurbishing the land based facility in Darwin.In August of this year - just two or three months ago - Australian and Indonesian officials held a major bilateral fishing meeting in Jakarta at which they discussed a wide range of issues and agreed upon a work program to expand and deepen fisheries and marine resources cooperation. -  - The opposition interject. They know nothing of these issues and have no interest in them; they have never asked a single question in 9½ years of opposition. It is left to an Independent member of the House of Representatives from Queensland to ask that question. It is a good question and I appreciate the honourable member's interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, and I can assure him that support for health insurance by the coalition parties has been one of the great constants of Australian politics. The private health insurance rebate has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government and, thanks largely to the private health insurance rebate, almost nine million Australians have access to the security and choice that private health insurance brings, including more than one million Australians with incomes of less than $20,000 a year.Today, as a further sign of the government's support for the private health sector, we announced a strengthened mediation role for the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, who will be given the same powers in respect of private hospitals that he currently has in respect of private funds. This government understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system without also having a strong private health sector.The government understands that; I am afraid that understanding is not universal in this parliament. I have been reading a very interesting book recently. It mostly deals with the toxic culture of the Australian Labor Party, but it also deals with private health insurance. I say to members opposite: do not be scared of reading The Latham Diaries. Do not put The Latham Diaries on the index of prohibited books. Do not be frightened of reading it. Members opposite will find on page 129 this entry from 22 February 2000:... Michael Costello - that is to say, the Leader of the Opposition's chief of staff - told me it - the private health insurance rebate - would be one of the first things abolished in our promises ... At different times Beazley has boasted to Caucus that it will go.I would also commend page 408 of The Latham Diaries, the entry from 13 January this year, where Mr Latham said of the second coming of the Leader of the Opposition:He'll be worse than ever, of course: good for nothing, stand for nothing.Of course, the member for Lalor says, 'People should pay attention to the truths in this book.'</DOC>

 - I did not mislead the House yesterday. The member for Griffith's question referred to the so-called kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, not Iraq. Let us just make it very clear. I also referred in my answer to the responses that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had given on this issue. Let us make it very clear. Yesterday you were talking about ALEA. ALEA surfaced as a result of the Volcker inquiry. Today you were asking questions about allegations of inflated prices in 2003. - With regard to the issue raised by the member of the allegations in 2003 - and that is all they were found to be - I do recall a number of public comments being made about those allegations in 2003. 
An honourable member - This is frivolous. - A number of public comments were made with regard to and in response to the allegations that the member for Griffith is referring to in 2003. I am just about to answer the question with regard to my knowledge of those. As I indicated earlier, I recollect being made aware of public comments made by AWB in response to allegations by the US Wheat Associates, commercial competitors of the AWB in this marketplace. A number of press releases were issued during the course of that debate by different people involved in this debate and by the AWB themselves. Comments were made by the government but there was also a comment, a joint press release, made by Senator Kerry O'Brien and Craig Emerson. Kerry O'Brien was then the shadow minister for primary industries; Craig Emerson was the shadow minister for innovation, industry and trade. - I have indicated my knowledge of that, but I am also highlighting the knowledge of others who made public comments at the time with regard to this and about the allegations that were made at the time. In the press release issued by Kerry O'Brien and Craig Emerson, they say:US Wheat Associates must be asked to substantiate its claims. - The point is very clear here. This was a matter that was out in the public arena. The whole country knew about it; it was being discussed publicly. That is how I knew about it - and everybody else, including Senator O'Brien and Craig Emerson. They went on to say in this press release:In the absence of evidence to support the allegations, Australian wheat growers are entitled to dismiss the claims as an attempt to promote the sale of US subsidised wheat in the Iraq market.That was the attitude taken by quite a number of people, including the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. I thought I might not get the opportunity to answer it. It is a very good question. Every year Australia spends $82 billion on welfare. It is a very generous act on the part of Australian taxpayers and it represents nearly 10 per cent of Australia's GDP: thank you, Treasurer. Fraud is a significant part of the framework. It is vitally important that we attack fraud to defend the interests of the Australian taxpayer. Last year, in response to 55,000 tip-offs, 3,500 Australians were prosecuted for welfare fraud. It is unfortunate, but it is very important for the protection of the taxpayer that we undertake those prosecutions. Cracking down on welfare fraud saves Australian taxpayers $4,000 every minute.In the last 12 weeks, as a result of our campaign called Support the System that Supports You, 27,000 Australians have updated their incomes or changed the information held by Centrelink, and we have had a further 9,000 tip-offs. This is a very important part of our program of trying to ensure that those people who are entitled to welfare receive the welfare and that those who are not entitled to welfare are either prosecuted for fraud or have their circumstances changed to make sure that they only receive the money they are entitled to.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. The government has worked hard to ensure that there are strong legislative frameworks in place to combat terrorism with tough laws that target terrorist activity. We know that terrorism does not respect our borders and our jurisdictions, so we need to be able to reach around the world. The government has acted to address this with measures to allow important evidence to be brought to a court using videolink technology. The new videolink provisions will apply to the prosecution of terrorism and related offences and to proceeds of crime proceedings relating to terrorist offences. Provided the defendant's right to a fair trial is not infringed, evidence can be adduced by videolink.The new measures strike a balance between facilitating the admission of videolink evidence for both prosecution and the defence and ensuring that fundamental safeguards are maintained. The court can require that an independent observer be present at the point where the witness is giving evidence by videolink. This is a safeguard that will ensure that the court is aware of circumstances under which the evidence is being taken.I am also pleased to be able to advise the House that the public response to the national security hotline is continuing. I am advised that the hotline has received more than 600 calls a week. More than 470, or close to 80 per cent, of these calls have provided valuable information which could be useful in counter-terrorism investigations. It is quite clear from the comments of the Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, that information from the hotline is a valuable resource for investigators, and obviously we thank the Australian community for their assistance.Members should also be aware that, as planned several months ago, the latest round of advertising for the national security hotline will begin this Sunday. The government is getting on with the job of combating terrorism at a variety of levels, from increased funding to our operational agencies, to terrorism offences and the tools to prosecute the offenders.</DOC>

 - The government's commitment to industrial relations reform is well known - very well known indeed. It has been very well known for a very long period of time. It remains the fact that this House has now passed the legislation and it will be up to those in another place to decide whether or not they give it the same measure of support.I believe that these measures will strengthen the Australian economy. They will create more jobs. They will lead to higher wages. They will not bring the end of the world. The sky will not fall in. People will not be murdered at picket lines. Brother will not be turned against brother. Friend will not be turned against friend. In 12 months time, the people of Australia will wonder what all your hullabaloo was really about.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Paterson and particularly acknowledge the role he played in helping his constituents who were so grievously affected by the second Bali bombing. It is nice for him to ask a question in front of the students of the Dungog Primary School who are here today, a school strongly supported by this side of the House.Reports overnight indicate that Jemaah Islamiah's master bomb maker and one of South-East Asia's most wanted terrorists, Azahari bin Husin, has been killed in the course of a police raid on a house in Batu in East Java. The Indonesian police were raiding the house following information that Azahari was present, but I would issue a word of caution that we cannot be 100 per cent sure that Azahari was one of the three people who have been found dead in that house, apparently as a result of suicide bombings on their part during the assault on the house. DNA tests will be done to endeavour to establish whether it was indeed him.If this was Azahari, then, whilst of course we do not wish people to be killed, it nevertheless has to be said that his no longer being capable of participating in terrorist activities will be a very good thing. His deadly bomb-making skills have been implicated in both of the Bali bombings, on 12 October 2002 and 1 October 2005. I remind the House that those two bombings killed 92 Australians. Azahari was implicated in the Marriott bombing of 2003, when 11 innocent people were murdered, and the bombing of our embassy in Jakarta on 9 September last year, when 10 innocent Indonesians were killed. There is no doubt that Azahari and Noordin Top, who is still on the loose, are the two most wanted terrorists in South-East Asia. If one of them is no longer active - to put it that way; if he has been killed - then the fact that he can no longer kill other people is a very good thing.Just in case there is some controversy about this in Australia, let me say that this demonstrates the determination of the Indonesian government to crack down on terrorism in, frankly, a pretty difficult environment. The Indonesian police have been extremely effective in countering terrorism. They have worked very hard at it, and often they have worked very courageously - let us not forget that. Apparently in the assault on this house one Indonesian policeman was shot in the leg. So they have been courageous but they have also been determined.I did not say anything about it at the time, but the House may have noted last week that the Indonesian government decided not to extend remission to Abu Bakar Bashir. I think we should all be careful what we say about that, but it was a decision by the Indonesian government that simply demonstrates the point that they are taking the issue of terrorism very seriously and they are fighting it with a good deal of efficacy.In conclusion, let me make one final point in answer to the honourable member's question. The Australian government condemns in the strongest of terms the vicious and cowardly attacks on hotels in Amman, Jordan, which we believe have killed at least 67 people. More could have been killed; those numbers could grow. Over 300 people have been wounded. From Australia's point of view, mercifully no Australian has been reported injured or killed at this stage. We are still looking and checking as best we can in Amman. We know of one Australian who was staying in one of those hotels but we also know that he is perfectly well, healthy and fit. This was a cowardly and vile act of terrorism, and our hearts go out to the families of the victims and to the government of Jordan at this difficult time.</DOC>

 - The World Bank! Before I reply to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, could I also have indulgence to add to something in the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to Abu Bakar Bashir. I would like to place on record my appreciation and, I think, the appreciation of all members of the House for the very patient and effective diplomacy that the minister has brought to that particular issue.My response to the Leader of the Opposition is to say that one of the reasons the Australian people should believe us is that over the last 9½ years the claims that we have made about the efficacy and effectiveness of our policies have been dramatically proved. They have been very successful.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. The labour force survey for the month of October showed that the unemployment rate increased slightly from 5.1 per cent to 5.2 per cent. This is a consequence of employment falling by 19,800 persons in the month of October. This comes off the back of exceptionally strong jobs growth over the last 12 months. Over the last 12 months nearly 230,000 new jobs have been created, with 45 per cent of them full time. In fact, up to August 2005 employment had risen by a record of around 402,000 persons.What we see in today's figures, I believe, is evidence of a moderating economy - employment is generally a lagging indicator. As we saw economic growth moderating through the earlier part of 2000, as I said, with a downturn in the construction sector of the economy, now we see employment outcomes moderating, although, as I informed the House earlier this week, the ANZ job advertisements point to some slowing in the months ahead but a pick-up sometime afterwards. Nevertheless, an unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent is still an unemployment rate of around a 30-year low. We have not been in a position to sustain unemployment below six per cent since monthly statistics started back in 1978.I would take from these results the fact that probably we have reached the cyclical low in terms of unemployment; after sustained growth, unemployment is at the cyclical low. We need structural reform in the Australian economy if we want to be able to take unemployment lower. Nothing could be more important than industrial relations reform. Of course, the Chicken Littles of the Australian Labor Party will tell you that the sky will fall in if we reform the labour market, just as they told us that the sky would fall in if we introduced the GST and just as they told us that the sky would fall in if we balanced the budget. The Chicken Littles of the opposition -  - or, in the case of the members for Perth and Lilley, the Roosters Little of the opposition - will tell you that, if you reform the Australian economy, the sky will fall in. But it was the reform of the Australian economy - with the monetary targets targeting inflation, the budget being balanced, $90 billion of Labor Party debt being paid off, the GST being introduced, capital gains tax being halved, income tax being reduced and indirect taxes being abolished - that got Australia to where it is now. It is the reform of today that will take this economy where we want it to be tomorrow. There should be no let-up in economic reform. It is the reform of today that will build the opportunity of tomorrow.</DOC>

I will never apologise for what this government did in relation to reform of the waterfront. If the member for Perth imagines that raising reform of the waterfront is some kind of killer blow, he is wrong. Those reforms of the waterfront resulted in a massive lift. For example, container movement went from 17 to 28 movements as a result of those reforms. For decades, the exporters of Australia had been begging a government to summon the courage to fix the waterfront - and Peter Reith had the courage to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question, because the bill that passed the House of Representatives today represents nine years of listening by this government to the employers and the employees of Australia about what is needed to update our century-old industrial relations system. The Work Choices bill stands in marked contrast to the blanket opposition for opposition's sake that we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him. Even before he had seen the bill, the Leader of the Opposition was promising to rip it up - even before he had seen it. This is just opposition for opposition's sake. What this confirms is that, basically, the Leader of the Opposition stands for nothing; he stands for nothing when it comes to these issues. All that the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about is opposing things for opposition's sake. There is a track record of this. - The Leader of the Opposition has a track record when it comes to opposition for opposition's sake. This is the man who opposed the Workplace Relations Act in 1996. This is the man who opposed, on some 41 separate occasions, attempts to reform the unfair dismissal laws. This is the man who opposed the new taxation system. This is the man who opposed the balancing of the budget. This is the man who opposed the privatisation of Telstra. Of course, he admits to this. Back in 2000, in an interview on 5AN Radio in Adelaide, he was quizzed about his negativity. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said:So you actually have a role to be carping _but carping, yeah, there is a role for this unfortunately.That is all we hear from the Leader of the Opposition. I looked up the dictionary to see if there were some synonyms for 'carping', and there are - complaining, moaning, nitpicking, fault finding and rousing. That is all we hear from the Leader of the Opposition - complaining, nitpicking, fault finding and carping all the time. -  -  - The member for Brand, in nine years, eight months and eight days, has done nothing but carp, carp, carp.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that I did not see the program. I was travelling between Canberra and Brisbane at the time the program was on to attend a longstanding commitment to a very reputable and very esteemed Queensland charity and also to make the acquaintance of a few hundred friends outside the gathering.Seriously, I will investigate the matter now that the member for Fowler has raised it. If there is anything I can provide to her by way of insights into what occurred, I will do so. Can I make the observation that you would imagine from the way the question has been phrased that, under the workplace relations system that the opposition espouses, there are never any disputes, there are never any differences, there is never any severance of employment and there are never any arguments between employers and employees. That is not the reality that the Australian community recalls and it certainly is a reminder of the vacuity of the attacks that are being made on this policy by the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. Many of the workers in the manufacturing industries in Adelaide in the electorate of Kingston take a great deal of interest in what we are doing as a government to improve the circumstances, productivity and competitiveness - and, therefore, the job security - of the workers in manufacturing industries. I said yesterday that Australia's exports last year reached a high of $162 billion. As a contribution to that, our manufactured exports grew by 6.5 per cent to reach $35 billion - a very good effort by Australia's manufacturing industries. The strongest contributors to that growth of 6.5 per cent were the metals and machineries exports out of Australia. If we are to continue this manufacturing exports success story, we have to build on the productivity gains that have already been put into place over the last decade. - What the government is proposing with its workplace relations reforms are very fair and reasonable workplace relations reforms that are supported by many industry groups and many individual businesses, large and small, in the manufacturing sector. The Australian Industry Group said:The Australian Industry Group believes that the changes are necessary to align the workplace relations system with the circumstances of modern industry and that they will boost productivity as a key part of the wider economic reform agenda.That is from the Australian Industry Group, representing a wide range of manufacturing exporting industries. International food and coffee manufacturing company and exporter Cerebos introduced AWAs into their workplace in 2004. Their human resources manager said:It was a collaborative rather than an adversarial process and helped employees and managers to view their work in less rigid institutionalised ways. The flexible nature of the agreements has created a family friendly work environment which is of ongoing benefit to both Cerebos and the employees.Thirdly, beverage manufacturer Juicy Isle introduced AWAs in 2000, as they were concerned about the number of different awards and unions that covered the workplace. They were also searching for an arrangement that allowed for extended shifts in their processing section. - Their AWAs provide for extended shifts where processing employees work an 11.5 hour day, four days a week. The weekly rostered days off are highly prized by employees, who have indicated that they strongly prefer to work hard for four days a week and have a day off in lieu. That business says:The main benefits of the AWAs are improved staff morale; reduced turnover, especially in the processing section; and more flexibility when negotiating with clients.Those examples point to the ability of the workplace under a flexible system to give better circumstances and conditions to the work force that suit their lifestyles and that are also beneficial to the productivity and the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. That is what this government is seeking to achieve with these fair and reasonable workplace reforms.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. That sort of question and that sort of allegation is of a piece with the sort of dishonest campaign that the Australian Labor Party has waged. It is not quite as bad as some of the other allegations that are being made - the allegation made in the Victorian parliament that women and children would be murdered on picket lines, the allegations made -  - I was asked whether the impact of these changes would be as alleged by the member for Sydney and I said no. Then I went on to liken the allegation she made with all the other absurd allegations that have been made. I return to what was said in the Victorian parliament. I know the Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed about the claim made by Mr Bob Smith MLC in the Victorian parliament that people on picket lines will be murdered. He said:Women and children were killed, and that is the road this Prime Minister wants to take us down. It is a disgrace.I think the person who uttered those words is a disgrace. But of course -  -  - Bob Smith? Yes, he is a prominent member of the Labor Party in Victoria. - I will simply make two points before concluding: the premise on which the member for Sydney's question was based is completely wrong; therefore her scare tactics in relation to child-care places are also wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I can indicate to her that the Work Choices bill will give all employees a guaranteed minimum of 10 days per year for personal and carers leave, which includes sick leave. This is important because this is the first time in federal legislation that employees have been guaranteed this minimum standard. The ALP and the ACTU have been running another inaccurate scare campaign arguing that, under the bill, employees must provide a separate medical certificate for every day that they take off on sick leave. That is absolutely wrong. The bill does not compel employers to demand a medical certificate in every instance; it merely allows them to do so if they require it.This morning the member for Perth claimed that the new provision 'seeks to change the current community approach and the current community standard'. He is absolutely wrong. There is nothing new about this provision. Let me take the House to why that is the case. Firstly, schedule 1A of the Workplace Relations Act, which in turn reflects the model carers leave clause - which was agreed between employer groups and the ACTU as part of the family provisions case - provides in respect of sick leave:An employee's entitlement to sick leave is conditional on the employee promptly notifying the employer of:any illness or injury ...If required by the employer, an employee who takes sick leave must establish by producing a medical certificate or making a statutory declaration that he or she was unable to work because of injury or personal illness.That is the provision in the current legislation. When it was put to Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, this morning on Radio National that the government points out that it is already the case in some areas and in some awards, he replied by saying, 'Well, it's not.' Can I take the House to a couple of award provisions in relation to this. Firstly, I go to the metals award. Clause 7.2.4(d) of the metals award, a current industrial instrument, says:The employee must, if required by the employer, establish by production of a medical certificate or statutory declaration, that the employee was unable to work because of injury or personal illness.There it is in black and white in the metals award. Let us go to another award, the transport workers award. Clause 39.3.2(c) reads:An employee shall prove by providing a medical certificate or other evidence to the satisfaction of the employer that the employee was unable on account of such illness or injury to attend for duty on the day or days for which sick leave is claimed.So the person who is absolutely wrong and misleading about this, once again, is Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU.In addition to that, there is actually a new provision in the Work Choices legislation which adds a further protection for employees. It provides that the section in relation to the production of a medical certificate does not apply to an employee who cannot comply with it because of circumstances beyond the employee's control. That is actually a new protection in the bill for employees, which does not exist at the present time in the Workplace Relations Act and does not exist in these awards. - The ACTU and the ALP have been caught out lying about these provisions. Why should there be such a provision in this legislation? There is a reason provided in the actions of workers on the construction of the Mandurah rail line, in the member for Perth's home state. We had 400 CFMEU members walk off the job on one day, all claiming that they had been subject to the flu that day. They all claimed that it was the flu that had brought them all off the job on the one day. Kevin Reynolds, the Secretary of the CFMEU, called this a 'legitimate industrial tactic'. Note what the Labor Premier of Western Australia, Dr Geoff Gallop, had to say about this. He said:... as a government we simply will not support blue flu as a tactic. We believe it is wrong and undermines the very point of having sick leave in our industrial relations system.Are the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party going to stand up for what Geoff Gallop knows is right, and had the courage to say was right, or is the Leader of the Opposition going to continue -  -  - In conclusion, I simply ask this question: is the Leader of the Opposition going to support what Premier Gallop in Western Australia knows is the right thing or is he going to continue to simply parrot the lines of the ACTU?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government, pursuant to its election commitment to develop a mandatory horticultural code of conduct, is in the process of doing exactly that. The code is being developed according to a clear process which conforms with the government's guidelines for prescribing mandatory industry codes under the Trade Practices Act 1974. I am consulting with all interested parties on an almost daily basis, taking account of many points of view. Before very much longer, the government will be announcing the mandatory horticultural code of conduct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He will be aware that all of our major ports are currently undertaking security assessments and are required to have security plans in place. The Gladstone port, which is one of our most important bulk-shipping ports, is a part of that process. The Office of Transport Security assesses these plans to make sure that there is an appropriate regime in place to protect Australian interests and to make sure that the operations of our ports are appropriately safe. Vessels coming to Australia are also subject to a security examination to ensure that those coming here and their crews are suitable to enter our ports.The Commonwealth has accepted responsibility for counterterrorism and prevention, particularly covering also now our offshore areas. Later this month we will begin the roll-out of the maritime security identification cards. Around 130,000 of these cards will be issued over the next 15 months, and we expect the scheme to be fully in place by the end of next year. That obviously also involves the port of Gladstone.We are recognised internationally for our leadership in maritime security and we are working with the international community to develop a scheme for satellite tracking of all security-regulated ships. In this environment it surprises me to have heard comments from the honourable member for Batman and the Leader of the Opposition about 'gaping holes in Australia's maritime security'. Unfortunately for them, the real agenda of the Labor Party in discussing maritime security was revealed by the shadow minister, Kerry O'Brien, when he spoke to the Maritime Union of Australia a couple of days ago. He really let the cat out of the bag as to why Labor are talking about security in our maritime industries. He saw it as an opportunity to wind back reforms in the maritime industry. He said to them that this was a real opportunity for the Australian shipping industry. They are trying to scare people into believing that somehow or other we should have more union representatives in each ship and more involvement with the Maritime Union. He praised them for their role in writing the Labor Party's maritime policy. He sees this as a way of introducing and winding back the reforms on the ports, the reforms in shipping, and the number of crew on ships. - The Labor Party is very sensitive about this issue and their determination to wind back reforms of the shipping industry, which would make the transport and trade of Australia less efficient and therefore less competitive. The reality - alluded to again earlier today - is that the significant reforms of our waterfront have made a big difference for Australia. Our capacity to effectively export our commodities in the most efficient way is under threat by Labor Party deals with the Maritime Union to wind back industry reform. Everybody ought to see it for what it really is.</DOC>

 - I am aware of a lot of commentary on this legislation. Let me say that the basic premise of this legislation is to provide greater flexibility in the workplace thereby leading to higher productivity, a stronger economy, higher real wages and more jobs. That is the essence. It is not about creating family unfriendly workplaces, it is not about separating families, it is not about setting brother against brother, it is not about preventing parents from spending Christmas Day with their children and it is not about people being murdered on picket lines; it is in fact about securing the economic future of the Australian nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and I appreciate his interest in the health policies of the Howard government. I can assure the member that the Howard government does not just talk about Medicare; we make the investments needed to make a good system even better. - I can assure the member for Wentworth that since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget and federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. This year the Howard government will spend $44 billion on health portfolio programs. - That is 44 billion reasons why the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. But we do not just spend public money on better health programs; we have attracted -  - The point I am making is that the Howard government has not just spent public money on health programs; the Howard government has attracted more private money into the health system through signature policies like the private health insurance rebate. -

With regard to the issue of transport, I would stress that the Chairman of the Wheat Export Authority, Mr Besley, advised the Senate estimates committee that there was no indication of inland transportation costs in the Australian Wheat Board documents which it examined. Under its monitoring and reporting framework, the WEA examines the sea freight associated with wheat exports and the domestic Australian freight costs associated with moving wheat from farm to port.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her interest and her question. She will be both interested and pleased to know that next week the defence minister, Senator Hill, and I will be hosting the 20th annual Australia-US Ministerial Consultations on the US alliance with the US Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Bob Zoellick. This meeting will be held in our home town of Adelaide. I think it will be a great event for Adelaide to have a meeting of such enormous international importance held in that great city. We very much look forward to the senior US delegation visiting Australia.The cooperation between Australia and the United States is simply enormous, and honourable members will, in particular, in these days when we are focused on the issue of terrorism, be interested to know that cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism is central to our efforts in this part of the world - not just beyond this part of the world but in this part of the world - to deal with the problem of terrorism. The American efforts in South-East Asia in the field of counter-terrorism are vitally important to the success of any struggle against terrorism.There is no doubt that, under this government, the alliance with the United States has never been stronger and, if I may say so, we have always been unapologetic about that. The government have always made the point - contrary to our political opponents - that we are able to have the strongest relationship Australia has ever had with the United States -  - while at the same time we build relations with our East Asian neighbours to a closer and more integrated degree than has ever been the case before. I think that is a great tribute to the Prime Minister and to the government for its efforts. The honourable member for Mackellar, by the way, asked me whether there are any alternatives. I think we all know that during the last election the Labor Party was led by Mark Latham -  -  - Those opposite did not think he was so boring when they were telling the Australian people to vote for him, though. All those opposite were elected on Mark Latham's coat-tails - let us not forget that! Their hero, their leader, the 'man of magic', as they were trying to tell us last year, was a man who had made it perfectly clear in his diaries - dare we mention them again - that the Labor Party -  - It was set up in 1986 -  - AUSMIN is the successor arrangement to the Australian-New Zealand-US ministerial talks. New Zealand of course resigned from the US alliance just, by the way, as Mark Latham wanted to. Mark Latham said that the alliance was 'the last manifestation of the white Australia policy' - and he was the Leader of the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Who cares what he thinks?' But last year he was telling us that Mark Latham should be the Prime Minister of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition rejoined the shadow cabinet as his shadow minister for defence, so great was his faith in Mark Latham. Last year the Leader of the Opposition told us he wanted Mark Latham to be Prime Minister; this year he says, 'Who cares what he thinks?' - It reminds me of a cartoon in the Australian that some of you may have seen. It was on the day of the Melbourne Cup. The cartoon featured the Leader of the Opposition going to a bookie, who was the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition was saying to the bookie, 'Five bob each way on everything.' That sums up the Leader of the Opposition. If ever there was any doubt, by the way, that the Labor Party was at the very best ambivalent about the alliance, you have only to look at the ANU Australian candidate survey, where the truth was told. Only 40 per cent - less than half - of Labor candidates at the last election said that the alliance was important for Australia's security. -  - I am perfectly in order.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no - absolutely no. But let me amplify why I say no. I amplify in two respects. This inquiry responds precisely to the request that was made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As the member for Griffith knows, I do not have the same unqualified faith in the United Nations that the member for Griffith has, because I have seen too many gaps in the capacity of the United Nations to respond to disastrous situations - I think of Rwanda, I think of Kosovo and I think of the speedy responses that have been given. A statement attributable to the spokesman for the Secretary-General of the United Nations says:He notes that a vast network of kickbacks and surcharges has been exposed, involving companies registered in a wide range of member states, and certified by them as competent to conduct business under the Programme.The statement then reports this:He hopes that national authorities - that, I assume, means the government of the Commonwealth of Australia - will take steps to prevent the recurrence of such practices in the future, and that they will take action -  The member for Denison then left the chamber. 
 - The statement then reports the following statement by the Secretary-General:He hopes that national authorities will take steps to prevent the recurrence of such practices in the future, and that they will take action, where appropriate, against companies falling within their jurisdiction.That is exactly what the government is doing. We are, to the letter, responding to the request made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I point out to the member for Griffith, who endeavours to smear the behaviour of ministers in this government, that, despite all the investigations made by Volcker and despite the fact that Volcker could make an adverse finding which related to the Indian foreign minister, which puts paid to the notion that in some way Volcker could not make comment about political parties or foreign ministers, there was not a zephyr of criticism offered of the government. That is the reason why the terms of reference are entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and for his great interest in aged care issues. Certain myths still abound in aged care, peddled mostly by the Labor Party. One is that most older people will go into residential aged care. In fact, because of the choices and services that are available, only 10 per cent of people over the age of 70 enter residential aged care at any time.While the government has increased the number of residential aged care places, we have also introduced a range of choices and options in services so that older people can remain at home. For example, we have increased low-level care through the community aged care packages and the high-level care in our EACH program, introduced dementia specific packages and dramatically increased the amount of respite that is available. This level of choice was not available under the Labor Party when it was in government.We now have another program of care, the Transition Care Program. This is to assist older people, after a hospital stay, to return home rather than go into residential aged care. The first 600 of these places have now been allocated. The member for Wakefield will be pleased to know that 90 of these places are now operational in South Australia and 10 more are operational in the ACT. By 2006-07, we expect there to be 2,000 of these transition care places. That will mean that each year 13,000 older Australians will be assisted with between eight and 12 weeks of post-hospital care so that there is an opportunity for them to return home and not enter residential aged care - or not prematurely enter residential aged care.Let me compare and contrast this government's support for aged care with that of the Labor Party. They neglected aged care when they were in government. They have abandoned it in opposition. I ask whether the Leader of the Opposition realises that it is well over 3,500 days since Labor had an aged care policy.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and for his interest and concern. I know a lot of the members of the House - if not all, for that matter - are very concerned about the fact that an Australian citizen, Van Nguyen, faces execution on Friday morning, having been convicted of a very serious drug offence. In this House, members overwhelmingly oppose capital punishment, and this government and the previous Australian government have always campaigned for clemency for Australians who have been sentenced to death.The government began making representations in support of Mr Nguyen when we argued that the charges against him should be reduced to a non-capital charge. This was before the trial began in November 2003. Going back over the files, I note that the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, raised the issue at a ministerial level with the Singapore government on 16 December 2002, four days after Mr Nguyen was arrested. Our High Commissioner in Singapore also made representations on these grounds to the Singapore Attorney-General in June 2003. When Daryl Williams was the Attorney-General, he did the same in August 2003, and I wrote to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore, Professor Jayakumar, in November 2003, making the argument for reducing the charges to a non-capital charge. If members of the House are interested, I will table the letter that I sent to Professor Jayakumar back in November 2003, so that people understand the length of the period for which we have been making representations and the different arguments that have been made during that period of time.Until clemency was formally rejected recently, the government deliberately pursued a purposeful and targeted approach with the Singapore government. We tended to keep the issue away from the media spotlight. That was a strategy that we developed with Van Nguyen's lawyers. As the House knows, strong representations have been made regarding this case to our counterparts in Singapore at the most senior levels on numerous occasions. I will not delay the House by reading them all out, but, again, I will table a list of some of the representations that have been made over recent times. These are over and above those that I have spoken about already.The fact is that an enormous number of representations have been made. Those who have been following the media recently will be aware that during CHOGM the Prime Minister again took time to raise the issue with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore. During those discussions with Prime Minister Lee, the Singapore Prime Minister again made it clear, of course - not to our surprise, and sadly - that Singapore intended to go ahead with the execution.I can only say in conclusion that I know members are saddened that the death penalty now confronts Van Nguyen. I think honourable members are aware of the enormous amount of effort that has been made by not just the government but other members of the House, both government and opposition. I know the member for Pearce and the member for Fowler, for example, made representations as leaders of a parliamentary delegation recently. They made them at amongst the highest of levels. You, Mr Speaker, have made representations, as have many others. So an enormous effort has been made. I have said all along - because I think it pays to be honest with people and to be frank about it - that, since the letter came from my Singapore counterpart, George Yeo, saying that the appeal for clemency had been rejected, I have been very pessimistic that there is anything more we can do. I have not wanted to hold out false hope.We continue to do what we can. We continue to work our way through all of the issues. But there is no doubt from the representations we have made to the Singapore government that, right from the very beginning, they have been absolutely determined to stick with their policy of capital punishment. As they have often said to us, bearing in mind that they execute their own people, to grant clemency to a foreigner would be impossible for them to explain to the families of Singaporeans who have been executed. That is their argument. They believe capital punishment acts as a powerful deterrent to drug trafficking, as well as other serious crimes. We do not all agree with that argument, but we have done everything we can in terms of diplomatic representations. In particular, over the weekend the Prime Minister has made a very real last effort with Prime Minister Lee.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question and for his concern. The government has examined very carefully the legal options that have been put forward, including those by Don Rothwell and Chris Ward, to whom the honourable member referred. Obviously I have also been in close contact with Lex Lasry and his team, and I have examined - and had examined, which is probably more to the point - the suggestions that they have brought forward.The problem is that every suggestion that has been put forward - with one exception, which I will come to - has required Singapore's agreement to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice for a case to be taken to the court. I had a letter yesterday from Don Rothwell, the professor of international law at Sydney university, and of course I have had some contact with him over the last week on this matter. His letter was really just to the effect that he would like us to ask Singapore to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in this matter, which is a reasonable proposition.I can tell the honourable member and the House more generally that the Prime Minister raised this very same point with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Malta. Prime Minister Lee made it clear that Singapore would not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and that had been the impression that we had had all along. That is, of course, not a surprising response from Prime Minister Lee, bearing in mind that Singapore have made it very clear they want to pursue the execution of Van Nguyen for heroin trafficking. We regret that the Singapore government have taken that view.The only other alternative which has been put to me, which was put to me by Chris Ward and Don Rothwell last week, related to article 36, from recollection, of the 1961 UN narcotics convention. We referred this proposition to the government's lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department and my department. They had a meeting with both Ward and Rothwell the following day, and they were very strongly of the view that no credible case could be brought to the International Court of Justice on the basis of the 1961 narcotics convention.Not prepared to give up on that, I then referred this case to Professor James Crawford, whom honourable members may know of. Those who have studied international law will certainly know of Professor James Crawford. He has represented Australia in the International Court of Justice and is a professor of international law at the University of Cambridge. Chris Ward suggested that we refer this case to Professor Crawford. Unfortunately, the advice we received from him was that there was no basis whatsoever for taking Singapore to the International Court of Justice on the basis of that convention.All of this is disappointing. I suppose that these same issues were examined back in 1993 and in the 1980s when Australians were executed by Malaysia. The sad thing is that at this stage we can find no aspect of international law which would enable us to take Singapore to the International Court of Justice without Singapore's consent, without them being prepared to allow the International Court of Justice to arbitrate and make a decision.Singapore have on one occasion accepted the court's jurisdiction, in relation to a territorial dispute with Malaysia, and I know the honourable member for Griffith has referred to this in public statements and press releases. But they have certainly made it clear that they will not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in relation to capital punishment and specifically in relation to Van Nguyen's case. - I make the point in response to that interjection that the Prime Minister did try, only yesterday.</DOC>

The member for Maranoa recognises only too well the significance of an ambitious outcome as far as the Doha Round of multilateral negotiations is concerned. Given that this round was launched in 2001, we are in the final stages of trying to conclude an outcome that will assist Australian farmers, manufacturers, service providers and exporters.The Prime Minister has just concluded the CHOGM in Malta. Prior to that, he was at a meeting of APEC leaders in Korea. At both those meetings he argued and led the case for a very strong call for those countries, those wealthy nations across the world, who are still currently holding out against an ambitious outcome in the Doha Round, to come to the party and to increase their proposals and their offers to do more, particularly as far as agricultural market access is concerned.It is important to note that the statements from CHOGM and the statements from APEC cannot be taken lightly. I am sure the rest of the world will take notice of what these two major groupings have had to say. Together, those two groups represent 4.4 billion people out of the world's population - more than two-thirds of the world's population - well over half of the world's total trade and about 65 per cent of global GDP. Those countries are calling on countries like those in the European Union and like Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Norway to increase their offers in terms of market access for, particularly, the agricultural producers from the developing countries of the world.Negotiations will continue in Hong Kong next month, where Australia and our allies, including the Cairns Group, will keep the pressure on those who are not ambitious enough to finalise the round in 2006. We now consider that this round is closer to fundamental reform in this area than the WTO has ever been before. But it is still balanced on a knife's edge. It could go either way. It is important that the strength of the voices of those 4.4 billion people are heard in the councils of the WTO, because we believe significant reform in agriculture will deliver the biggest dividend for the developing world. Without new trade flows in agriculture, we will lose the opportunity to lift millions of people out of poverty, not to mention the benefits that will accrue to Australia's farmers and manufacturing industries.I am pleased that the Prime Minister has been able to play such a crucial role in developing this and in convincing his colleagues at CHOGM and also in the APEC leaders meeting to make very positive statements and to call on those nations, particularly those member states in the European Union, to be more forthcoming and engaged in seeking a decent outcome that will lift millions of people across the world out of poverty as a result of trade liberalisation.</DOC>

 - Can I clarify a couple of points made by the Leader of the Opposition. First, our workplace reforms are not extreme; they are fair and reasonable. Second, he referred to proposed amendments as 'token'. The government is still working through those and having discussions with those that have expressed concerns, in terms of addressing some of these issues. Third, it is not true to say that all workers will not be paid penalty rates on public holidays. Workers, even today, that are under certified agreements or awards have that structured in that area. Workers today who have negotiated AWAs have already made their own arrangements in the rates of pay they will have. So to make the allegation that people will be forced to work for peanuts is just ludicrous. Certainly it falls into the same category as many of the other ludicrous allegations that the Labor Party have made in this whole debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. Like me, I am sure that he will believe that a company like James Hardie, which is responsible for manufacturing a dangerous product and which has a liability to users of that product, should observe its liabilities to victims and their families. The attempt to restructure assets to put them away from the reach of potential claimants ought to be thoroughly condemned. I think those directors of James Hardie, if they had knowledge that they were doing it for that reason, would think again. It should not have been tried, it should not have been done and it should not succeed.Settlement of these claims has been proceeding between the company and victims groups in the state of New South Wales. The Commonwealth has not been a party to those negotiations, but there has been a suggestion that as part of the settlement directors of James Hardie will be given civil immunity by the New South Wales government. The Commonwealth will not support any civil immunity for directors of James Hardie given by the New South Wales government or otherwise.I call on the federal Labor Party to endorse the Commonwealth government's position. The Commonwealth government has set aside $7½ million to fund an investigation and litigation of issues arising from the Jackson report. If an immunity is given to the directors of James Hardie, that will frustrate that investigation. As the Deputy Chairman of ASIC said to a Senate estimates committee in the week of 30 May, extinguishing civil penalty for James Hardie directors 'may have the effect of neutralising the entire investigation and the outcome'. So we call on the New South Wales government not to give any immunity whatsoever to the directors of James Hardie and we indicate to the New South Wales government that the Commonwealth will not be assisting.In addition to that, I would make clear that James Hardie, as responsible to the victims of asbestosis, will be required to comply with Australian tax law. If it makes a payment that is tax deductible, that will be deductible under Australian tax law. If it makes a payment that is depreciable, that will be depreciable under Australian tax law. If it wants to take advantage of black hole expenditures, it can take advantage of black hole expenditures. James Hardie can structure its payments to take advantage of the tax law.The suggestion however that this parliament should pass a new tax law so that the taxpayer picks up some of the obligations of the directors and the shareholders of James Hardie will not be agreed to by the Commonwealth parliament. Passing a special law so that shareholders' obligations are picked up by the Australian taxpayer is the equivalent of asking that the taxpayer pay a sum - which would be a much more honest way of doing it - to pick up the obligation of James Hardie's shareholders. It is not the taxpayers' obligation to pick up the obligation of the James Hardie shareholders or their directors. The James Hardie directors ought to accept responsibility for the victims, for the poor people who have been injured by their product, and the shareholders ought to be bearing the cost of that rather than putting it off onto the Australian taxpayer.</DOC>

 - I have no problem with Mr Gerard as a member of the Reserve Bank board. I think he brings a great understanding of the Australian manufacturing industry to the board. But, seeing as this question today was totally anticipated, let me answer the question in some detail. Any person who is considered for an appointment to any Commonwealth government body is required to sign a declaration of interest which states that they have no private interests, including those of a taxation nature, that would conflict with their responsibilities or cause embarrassment to the government. That I think was the declaration of interest which was signed by all appointees under the Labor government, and indeed was signed by Mr Gerard.In addition to that, Mr Gerard forwarded to the government a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation dated 3 March 2003, which reads as follows - and I will table this:As requested, I am writing to confirm my previous advice that there are no current disputes with the Tax Office in respect of your personal affairs.So not only did the taxpayer sign that declaration and warrant, but indeed the Commissioner of Taxation. Tax matters are matters between taxpayers and the commissioner. I have read today's Financial Review.  -  - I thought the honourable members opposite would be interested in the facts.  -  
 - When the Leader of the Opposition ceases interjecting, I will go on with the facts. - I thought the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in the facts. The facts are these. It is quite common for people to have disputes with the Australian Taxation Office. Every taxpayer is entitled to take those matters to court if they so wish. I would be very surprised if there were not numbers of directors from numbers of companies who have served on the Reserve Bank board whose companies have not had disputes with the Australian Taxation Office.I know there's an issue - that is, the Treasurer said - with the Tax Office but I don't have a problem with you on the board.We asked if such a statement was made. Did he say that? - Because I know the members of the opposition will be interested: I would be very surprised if there were not other companies who have directors on the board of the Reserve Bank whose companies have not been in dispute with the Australian Taxation Office at one time or another. They are entitled to contest their rights in court. Any company is entitled to do that. As I read the Australian Financial Review - and I cannot vouch for the accuracy of that - the allegation that is made in relation to Gerard Industries is that it settled all of its affairs with the Australian Taxation Office in their entirety, including primary tax, interest - Opposition members - Ha, ha!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and recognise the great job he does representing those two great provincial cities of Bundaberg and Gladstone in Queensland. There is, of course, a great food bowl of exports coming out of that part of Australia - and manufactured exports as well. - Just listen and you will hear about some. I happened to be in the electorate of Hinkler only the week before last and whilst I was there we visited a company called AusChilli, which has been exporting for about the last seven years. AusChilli is a company that manufactures processed food products. It produces 30 pureed food products and exports them to 14 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Manufacturing companies like AusChilli have been helped particularly by the government's strong economic management over the last nine or so years in creating an environment and a solid platform for them to compete in the international marketplace, as well as by a number of programs through which the government provides assistance in the marketing of their products overseas.The government recognise that we cannot just stop here. We have to continue to help improve the economic environment in Australia and we are doing that through our workplace reforms program that we are putting forward at the moment. That is the next step. A single national workplace relations system will maintain our strong economy and provide the support Australian exporters and their employees deserve. The new legislation continues to protect workers. All agreements will have to comply with the Australian fair pay and conditions standard, which will include the 38-hour week, annual leave, personal and carers leave and parental leave. The new system will protect award conditions such as public holidays and penalty rates where new agreements are negotiated. These award conditions can only be removed if an employee specifically agrees to change them in an agreement.Coming back to AusChilli in the member for Hinkler's electorate, AusChilli now has 35 full-time employees in their factory, all employed on AWAs. I will leave the last word on this issue to the owner and the founder of the business, David Depoli, who said last week:Australia needs to adopt new ways of doing business at home and overseas. New industrial relations laws will give companies more flexibility to meet customers' requirements by employers and employees working together for a win-win situation. Sustainable success is by team effort.We will continue to work with and listen to the job creators in Australia while the Labor Party continue to work for the job destroyers in Australia.</DOC>

 - I have already answered this question. What I said to Mr Gerard was that he would have to give an undertaking as to his tax affairs. Mr Gerard said that he was able to give that undertaking and in fact did give that undertaking. - Mr Gerard not only said that he would be giving the undertaking - he did one better than that: he sent a letter from the tax commissioner, which I have just tabled in the parliament, saying that the tax commissioner had no dispute with him. From that point of view, the government had both an undertaking from the taxpayer and a statement from the commissioner which indicated that there was no dispute in relation to his tax affairs and the matter went to cabinet in the ordinary way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Sensis Business Index for November 2005 was released today indicating that business confidence amongst small and medium enterprises remains broadly unchanged after a strong result in the previous quarter. Small to medium sized enterprises are upbeat about their trading conditions over the next year, and their overall perception of the current state of the economy improved. On nearly all of the indicators, except for capital expenditure, expectations were stronger. Sales growth and employment growth, in particular, showed solid improvement.The Sensis business survey did ask questions about industrial relations. It found that a majority of businesses believed that the changes would have no impact. But, of those that did believe that the changes would have an impact, it was two to one in favour of the industrial relations changes which are proposed by this government. So in relation to small business there was a two to one support for the government's industrial relations changes; although, as I said earlier, many businesses anticipated no change. If you have over a million small businesses in Australia, the fact that by a majority of two to one they believe industrial relations changes will help their business actually gives a very substantial impact in relation to employment, profitability and trading conditions. - The Australian Labor Party, I know, have never pretended to be a small business party or to support small business, but they may pay heed to the fact that one million small businesses in Australia, two to one, believe that industrial relations changes are necessary in this country. They may have the fortitude to stand behind those changes, because they will be good for Australia. The Australian Labor Party ought to get behind reform and do what is right for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - Of course, the member for Lilley tries to make an insinuation which is false in the first part of his question. I have said precisely what the nature of my discussion with Mr Gerard was. I expect that Mr Gerard himself, knowing his tax affairs, will most probably make a statement about what the Australian Financial Review says, but can I indicate that, from the government's point of view, both the taxpayer and the commissioner - and the commissioner is a person of a certain weight in this - said that there was no dispute. I also indicate that the Australian Financial Review says that all matters have been settled, and not only primary tax but interest and penalties have been paid. Also, in my experience, where a case is settled, it is usually settled without admissions, and no admissions necessarily follow from that settlement. Having mentioned all of those matters, can I say why I believe that Mr Gerard is eminently suitable to be a member of the Reserve Bank board. As Chairman and Managing Director of Gerard Industries Pty Ltd, his company has employed 3,300 people. - And these of course are questions that go to whether or not Mr Gerard should be a member of the Reserve Bank board. - Oh, they don't? 
An opposition member - No, they don't. - Okay, so we now have three questions which are irrelevant to whether or not someone should be on the board, Mr Speaker. We have just had an admission that he is not interested in whether or not Mr Gerard is fit for the board. We now know that the opposition - you may not have intended to say it - supports Mr Gerard being on the board. If that is the case, what is the point of the questions? We all agree - there is bipartisan agreement - that he is a fit and proper person to be on the board. It is quite bipartisan: both sides of the parliament agree now, by admission from the Leader of the Opposition, that he is a fit and proper person to be on the board. - And why? Let me tell you: because his company employed 3,300 people in Australia -  - I repeat again: there is bipartisan agreement that Mr Gerard is a fit and proper person to be on the Reserve Bank Board, as the Leader of the Opposition said. He is a major employer, a major manufacturer, South Australian of the Year -  - He is South Australian of the Year, the sponsor of the Clipsal 500 in South Australia and an officer in the general division of the Order of Australia, with the Commissioner of Taxation saying that his affairs were not in dispute with the tax office. I would have thought that that is the reason why there is bipartisan agreement in this parliament that he is fit and proper to be on the Reserve Bank Board.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. Last Thursday I was able to present the 2005 Work and Family Awards in Sydney. The winner of the Small Business Employer of the Year award was Austral Tree and Stump Services of Adelaide, which I understand operate in the electorate of the honourable member for Makin. I congratulate Austral on their work practices, which enabled them to win this award.The employees of Austral Tree and Stump Services are covered by Australian workplace agreements which contain a number of family-friendly provisions. These provisions include flexible start and finish times, flexible working days, paid time off during school holidays for employees with children, employee-nominated hours of work and employees banking additional hours worked for paid or unpaid leave.All of these flexible arrangements and conditions are things which would not have been possible under an award. Indeed, one of the employees of Austral at the awards ceremony last Thursday night told of how he was able to work on a fortnightly basis, working five days one week and two days the next. These family-friendly provisions enabled him to have custody of his children at a time when he was separated from his wife. He went on to say that, because of the flexibility offered by this Australian workplace agreement, he was able to reconcile with his wife. In part of his speech at the awards, he said this about a family-friendly workplace in action:My story is testimony to the benefits of having a workplace agreement. The freedom to negotiate flexible hours has given me the opportunity to build a closer relationship with my kids.That is the testimony of a man who is working under a family-friendly Australian workplace agreement. - This not only shows what can be achieved by employers and employees working together under individual Australian workplace agreements but puts the lie to the claim of the Leader of the Opposition that somehow these changes will lead to an increase in separation and divorce in Australia. Here is a case where a man and a woman have been able to reconcile and get back together because of the flexibility offered in an Australian workplace agreement.On Sunday on The Insiders program we saw the Leader of the Opposition interviewed. He was asked, amongst other things, if there were any elements of these new laws which he would retain, and he said, 'None at all.' That means that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip up and roll back this sort of arrangement, which has enabled this family to function in the way they want to. That is what he wants to do. We will continue to prosecute the case for AWAs and family-friendly provisions that work for real people, as this instance indicates.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of any such thing. The Australian Financial Review purports to report on a tax investigation which would never be given to a Treasurer or any other member of parliament and which, as I understand it, would be confidential to the commissioner and the taxpayer. To ask whether I would be aware of a tax investigation into an individual's affairs is basically to ask whether I would breach the secrecy act and demand documents or investigations with regard to particular taxpayers. I would no more demand them in relation to Mr Gerard than I would demand them in relation to the member for Lilley.Imagine if tax investigations or taxpayers' affairs were given to politicians, Mr Speaker! Can you imagine the proper political outcry that there would be? I am very surprised that the question has actually been asked. Even if the report were true, to suggest that a politician would get their hands on the tax investigation into a taxpayer when there are secrecy provisions in relation to the Australian Taxation Office is a very dangerous precedent and certainly one which this side of politics would not endorse.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I think all members of the House would agree that he is a great representative of his electorate and of the Defence Force personnel in his electorate. Since the House last met, Senator Hill, the defence minister, and I met with our American counterparts - the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Bob Zoellick - for the 20th annual AUSMIN consultations. I am proud to say, and some honourable members will agree with me, that these were held in Adelaide. These were the first AUSMIN consultations ever held in Adelaide but, Prime Minister, not necessarily the last. - This was an important opportunity for Australia and the United States to not just share our perspectives but ensure we work together on key issues. - Thanks, Mr Speaker. A genius there! The talks covered security issues of common concern, including Iraq and Afghanistan. - They obviously do not want to hear about the Australia-US alliance, and I think we know why. Practical steps at this meeting were agreed on, very importantly, intensifying and coordinating our efforts on counter-terrorism in this part of the world, in South-East Asia; on continuing to work closely on the proliferation security initiative; on increasing our information sharing of military and counter-terrorism operations; and on strengthening our defence relationship, including through a program of US strategic bomber training in Australia and the development of a joint combined training centre. These talks simply highlighted the very great strength of the alliance and the importance of it, not just for Australia's security but for the broader security of the western Pacific region. The fact is that the alliance has never been stronger than it is today.The honourable member asked whether there are any alternatives. Indeed there are. There is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian National University-led Australian candidates study I think provides a very clear insight into the views of the Labor Party on the US alliance. It conducted a confidential survey of 533 candidates that stood at last year's election and aggregated the results by party affiliation. - I was asked whether there are any alternative positions, and there are. There is the position of the Australian Labor Party. -  - I have noticed you try to close down this debate every time it comes up, which is very revealing. Only 40 per cent of Labor candidates at the last election said they thought the alliance was very important. - So remember that 60 per cent of Labor candidates at the last election did not think the alliance with the United States was very important. Thirty-one per cent said they had little or no trust in the United States coming to the defence of Australia, and 22 per cent said the US was very likely or fairly likely to be a threat to Australia. So nearly a quarter of Labor candidates at the last election thought that America was a threat to Australia. - At the last election the current Leader of the Opposition was the shadow minister for defence. He and the member for Griffith, we know, knew that the then Leader of the Opposition opposed -  - Yes, Mr Speaker. You will be pleased to hear that the conclusion of this question is that the alliance with the United States is never going to be secure under the Labor Party, which does not support it.</DOC>

 - I have already answered that question by saying that tax investigations are not given to members of the government. I read in the Financial Review that it purports to have such an investigation, but it certainly is not an investigation which has been given to the government and certainly not one which has been given to me. In fact, I may read out an answer on a very similar question:The secrecy provisions of Australian income tax law prevent the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers from disclosing the income tax affairs of an individual taxpayer without the express authority to do so.The answer goes on:I am therefore unable to answer this part of the honourable member's question.That was an answer given by PJ Keating on 5 April 1989 to a question about the tax affairs of Sir Peter Abeles, a Labor appointee to the Reserve Bank board. I table that answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and also for his untiring efforts for the resource sector in Australia, which continues to go from strength to strength. The figures speak for themselves. In 2004-05, resource exports were worth $67.4 billion. In 2005-06, exports are expected to grow to a massive $87 billion. As well as that, there are some 241 major resource projects currently under way in Australia, of which a record 84 are well advanced. These projects are worth some $29 billion combined. - These outstanding results in the resources sector are no accident. They come through the resources sector building its competitive advantage through an impressive mix of investment, innovation and, of course, industrial relations improvements. - In fact, as at 30 June 2005, some 33,000 Australian workplace agreements were operating in the mining sector. That is, about 60 per cent of all mining employees are now covered by federal agreements - and, by anyone's measurement, that is a very impressive result.Could I quote some people who are involved very closely in the resources sector in Australia. Firstly, Tim Shanahan, Chief Executive of the Western Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says that 'Australian workplace agreements have sustained the dramatic increases in productivity across the Western Australian resources sector' - I think you would be interested in that, Leader of the Opposition. The BHP Billiton Iron Ore president, Graeme Hunt, says that direct employee-employer relationships have produced high pay, more flexible employment practices, higher productivity, performance linked pay and fewer industrial relations disputes. Mr Hunt says:The track record is very clear. We really can't afford to step backwards ...This government is committed to taking the industry forward with modern IR reforms, which deliver greater flexibility, productivity and jobs. Obviously those who sit opposite do not believe me, so let me quote what Rio Tinto's Charlie Lenegan said of the system. He said that it will 'deliver on substantial areas where we can improve our business'.All this good news is a far cry from the doom and gloom that have been projected perhaps by the member for Hunter. The reality is that Labor's proposal to roll back IR is a backwards step and a clear threat to the resources industry and the future competitiveness of Australia's industry.</DOC>

 - I have already answered this question on two occasions. Could I indicate that, as is always the case in relation to Commonwealth government appointments, a statement is sought from a taxpayer. Unusually, in this case, the taxpayer also provided a letter from the commissioner. The taxpayer and the commissioner seem to have no dispute between them. I do not believe that it is the role of an MP to call for tax returns, and no Treasurer has done it.I have already indicated that this was the procedure adopted by the Australian Labor Party and by Mr PJ Keating and that these declarations were the practice of the Australian Labor Party. The secrecy provisions of the tax act have been in place for a long time. The answer that was given to Mr PJ Keating in relation to tax affairs was precisely the same. I would say to the member for Lilley that I would move his suspension and censure quickly because he is running out of steam.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question and his interest in workplace relations, both in Western Australia and generally throughout this nation. Since 1996, Australia has enjoyed the lowest levels of industrial disputation since records were first kept - and that goes back to 1913.The member for O'Connor asked me about workplace relations in the state of Western Australia. We see there a clear indication of what happens when a weak Labor government rolls back industrial relations changes. Since the Gallop government came to power in Western Australia in 2001, we see that Western Australia is the strike capital of Australia. Working days lost due to industrial disputes in Western Australia have more than doubled since the Gallop government came to office. In 2001 the rate of disputes was 32 working days lost per 1,000 employees. In 2004 that had risen to 76.9 working days lost per 1,000 employees. In the building and construction industry in Western Australia, the record is far worse.We have also seen the return of 'no ticket, no start' on Western Australian building sites. We have seen major projects plagued by industrial action, such as the Perth-Mandurah railway project, so much so that the new Australian Building and Construction Commissioner has intervened in those proceedings because the Gallop government in Western Australia simply will not take action in aid of this major infrastructure project. It is no wonder, because we have reports that the union heavies, such as Kevin Reynolds from the CFMEU, have been threatening the preselection of Labor Party candidates and MPs if they do not support a roll-back of the system in Western Australia.Look what employees have done in Western Australia since the Gallop government came to office. Over 120,000 employees in Western Australia have fled the state industrial system to move on to the federal industrial system and take up and make use of Australian workplace agreements - more than any other state in Australia. In contrast, in the first two years following the Gallop government's Labour Relations Reform Act, only 547 state enterprise bargaining agreements were registered with the Industrial Relations Commission in that state. Over 120,000 employees fled the state industrial relations system in Western Australia to come into the federal industrial relations system.Here is an example of the actual numbers involved. In the Leader of the Opposition's electorate of Brand, there are more than 13,000 Australian workplace agreements. In the member for Perth's electorate, there are over 7,000 people with Australian workplace agreements. Twenty thousand employees in those two electorates alone in Western Australia see the advantages and the flexibility offered by Australian workplace agreements. Of course, the great benefit of that is that they get paid more. If you look at the average payment for workers on Australian workplace agreements, they are $444 per week better off than people on awards and $103 per week better off on average than those who are on collective agreements.The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to rip up something like a $5,000 per year wage differential in the advantage of those employees in his electorate of Brand in Western Australia. This is not a rip-up; it is a rip-off, if it were ever to be enacted.</DOC>

 - Again, of course, he misrepresents in his question what I have told the House. I refer back to the Hansard of what I told Mr Gerard. I told Mr Gerard what I tell everybody who is being considered for a Commonwealth appointment - that they will be required to sign a declaration, which everybody signs, which was signed under the Australian Labor Party. Mr Gerard not only signed that but forwarded to me a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, which confirmed that the Commissioner of Taxation also had no problems. If the taxpayer gave the undertaking and the commissioner gave the undertaking, to me he got from both sides of the equation a very strong position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and his interest in this vitally important issue. Avian influenza, or bird flu, poses a significant risk to Australia, as my colleague the minister for health has made clear. Earlier today, the minister for health and I visited Exercise Eleusis, which is imitating a genuine outbreak of avian influenza and allows for real-time reactions and responses. It is being headquartered at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry but involves some 1,000 people across many jurisdictions, including all of the states and territories, egg and chicken meat industry organisations, veterinary and animal health bodies and medical authorities.The exercise takes as its concept the transportation of chickens from the Mornington Peninsula, in Victoria, across to a farm at Mount Gambier where a death rate is detected but, in the meantime, the chickens are further transported back to St Arnaud in Victoria for processing, and simultaneously some of the chickens are going north to Camden. You have three states where the outbreak has occurred, so immediately the isolation and culling takes place, as does the separation of the districts from possible contamination outwards. Also, health authorities, hospitals and GPs are getting involved. You can see that it is a vital exercise involving people who would be called on to deal with a real outbreak of bird flu, should that ever occur. The point of Exercise Eleusis is to show us how well we are able to cope with a threatened pandemic and, importantly, how we can improve both our preparedness and our response.I stress, as the minister for health has, that humans are generally not affected by avian influenza. People do not become infected with avian influenza from eating cooked chicken meat or eggs. I also wish to emphasise that the exercise is not taking place because of some imminent risk but because the government wishes to maintain the highest standards of preparedness. It is attracting international attention, even with some international participation.I wish to thank the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Ageing and all those involved in the exercise, for the diligence and responsibility with which they discharge their responsibilities. They are working in the interests of all Australians.</DOC>

 - I certainly can understand why the member for Dobell is interested in this topic. I can inform him that the GP bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Dobell is up 13.7 percentage points since December 2003. In New South Wales the GP bulk-billing rate is now 81.2 per cent. Bulk-billing, I hasten to add, is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly for pensioners and children. To this end the policies of the Howard government have meant that in the September quarter the national GP bulk-billing rate hit 74.9 per cent. For children under 16 the GP bulk-billing rate has hit an all-time high of 82.1 per cent.Since 2003 the bulk-billing rate in New South Wales has gone up by 5.5 percentage points; in Western Australia it has gone up by 7.4 percentage points; in Victoria it has gone up by 8.9 percentage points; in Queensland it has gone up by 10.7 percentage points; in South Australia it has gone up by 12.8 percentage points; and in the great state of Tasmania the GP bulk-billing rate has increased by a massive 19.4 percentage points. All of this helps to demonstrate that the Howard government truly is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.Meanwhile, while we are getting on with the job of government, what is the Leader of the Opposition doing but suffering from roid rage with his speech on the weekend, calling people 'animated raccoons' - which reminds me of the comments of the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, who said:People think Beazley is a big angel, but behind the scenes he is in the gutter. He and his allies reflect the worst instincts of the Labor movement: all gossip and muck.That is the man who the member for Lalor still thinks always tells the truth.</DOC>

 - I will make a couple of observations as part of the answer I give. The first is that, by his own admission, the opposition leader is not disputing the suitability of Mr Gerard to be on the board of the Reserve Bank. This is not an exercise about the integrity of Robert Gerard; this is an attempt by the Australian Labor Party to discredit my friend and colleague the Treasurer. - The second observation I would make is that it is often the case that people have differences of opinion with the Australian tax office. Taxpayers have a right to have a difference of opinion with the Australian tax office - there is nothing particularly revolutionary about that. But at least Mr Gerard appears to have filed his tax return, which is more than can be said about some other people who are of lesser memory in the context of a debate like this. I remind the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - In your dreams! You are having a bad day. You gave yesterday away. Now what are we - at three o'clock and not a question on IR! I do not understand it. The relevant point about the dispute between Mr Gerard and the Australian Taxation Office is that, by hand of the letter from the commissioner, all the outstanding matters were resolved. So what is the fuss all about?</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I note the concern on this side of the House about the situation in Zimbabwe. I particularly was impressed with the speech made yesterday by the member for Cook in debate on his private member's motion.The elections for a newly created Senate in Zimbabwe were an act of cynical political patronage for President Mugabe's cronies. The real needs of the people of Zimbabwe are being completely ignored. Overall figures have yet to be released, but preliminary results suggest that there was an extremely low turnout in these elections - somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent. One observer said that it was the lowest turnout since 1980. There were reports that some of the polling stations were completely deserted. This simply demonstrates the almost total collapse of democratic processes in Zimbabwe and the irrelevance of the process. It will not shock anyone to hear that President Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, won, we believe, 42 out of the 50 seats that were contested. Just in case honourable members were wondering, President Mugabe is going to appoint another six people himself. That will take his numbers up to 48.This farce has been played out at the expense of the ordinary people of Zimbabwe, a country with 75 per cent unemployment, an inflation rate of over 300 per cent and acute shortages of necessities of all descriptions caused by appalling economic management. The national airline of Zimbabwe ran out of fuel last week.Australia will continue to be at the forefront of international efforts to persuade not just President Mugabe but his government and the people of Zimbabwe to change course. There are our sanctions regime, our humanitarian assistance work and our work with like-minded countries in trying to get Zimbabwe's leadership before the International Criminal Court on a reference from the Security Council and expelled from the IMF. That work will continue.Finally, let me say that, hard as we may try, ultimately the people in the international community who we urge to place still more pressure on President Mugabe are those in the regional countries, the countries that neighbour Zimbabwe. As the Prime Minister says, they are the countries in southern Africa that have to maximise the pressure on that regime.</DOC>

 - It has taken us until the 10th question from the opposition, but finally we have a question which reveals the true nature of the objections that the Labor Party has to Mr Gerard. The true nature of the objections was framed in that question - that Mr Gerard is unfit for public office because he has made donations to the Liberal Party. That is the real objection that Labor has to Mr Gerard. It took 10 questions to get here, but that was disclosed by the nature of that question.Can I say - and I suppose I do not speak for both sides of the House - that we do not think that supporting the Liberal Party is a disqualification from office in Australia. We do not think that. We do not think that supporting the Liberal Party is a disqualification from holding ministerial office, prime ministerial office, Treasury office or other offices in Australia. There might have been some attempt by the Labor Party to dress it up - that somehow they were against anybody who had supported a political party being on the Reserve Bank board. Mr Speaker, let me remind you of some of the appointments to the Reserve Bank board made by Labor governments. First of all, Labor appointed ACTU president Bob Hawke to the Reserve Bank board. Notoriously independent when it came to political matters, Mr Bob Hawke! When he retired, we had Nolan. I forget his name, but I am pretty sure that Nolan was an ACTU -  - Peter Nolan was a trade union official of some kind or another. Then there was a Fitzgibbon. I might be wrong about it, but I would not be surprised if that was also a Labor appointee. He served right up until we got another notorious independent on the Reserve Bank board, one William Kelty, the ACTU secretary, who served on the Reserve Bank board. And just in case you thought that the Labor Party only appointed unionists, we had Sir Peter Abeles, who served on the Reserve Bank board. I could go on and on. Janet Holmes a Court served on the Reserve Bank board.So for all the bluster, for all the pretence, for all the questions that say if you have been a supporter of one side of politics it disqualifies you from the Reserve Bank board, let me make it clear that the Labor Party, in government, practised as an art form the appointment of Labor apparatchiks, in the case of Kelty and Hawke, to the Reserve Bank board.Let me finish off by saying why Mr Robert Gerard is suitable to go on the Reserve Bank board. He is a major manufacturer, and his companies have employed 3,300 people in Australia. He is an officer in the Order of Australia, he is South Australian of the Year and his companies were sponsors of the Clipsal 500. South Australian Premier Rann was proudly standing with Mr Gerard when his companies were sponsoring the South Australia Clipsal 500. Premier Rann apparently did not have any great objections to Rob Gerard when it came to him endorsing the grand prix. He did not have a problem at all, and he stood there proudly. He did not have a problem taking the sponsorship. It is only when Mr Gerard goes on the Reserve Bank board that he suddenly becomes unfit for public office.Let us nail these allegations. Let us nail them before the member for Lilley gets up and moves his censure motion, which he has been dying to do for the last 10 questions and which he should have done much earlier, when he had at least a bit of momentum. The real objection is that a successful manufacturer in Australia has, over the years, been engaged in politics. That is not a disqualification for office in Australia. His tax affairs were cleared by the Commissioner of Taxation, and he brings an important perspective from one of the smaller states and, in particular, from manufacturing industry to the Reserve Bank board. I now invite the member for Lilley to stand up and move his censure motion.</DOC>

 - As I made clear yesterday, what I said to Mr Gerard - and I will repeat it - is that, in order for his appointment to go forward to the cabinet, he would have to give an assurance about his tax affairs in a standard form, which he said he was able to do and which in fact he did. In addition to that, he forwarded to the government a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, which I tabled yesterday, which said that the Tasxation Office had no current disputes with Mr Gerard. I indicated to them that, given the fact that he had given an undertaking - and, indeed, the commissioner had given an undertaking - it could go to the cabinet. It went to the cabinet; it was approved by the cabinet. Mr Gerard has been on the board for 2½ years. In those 2½ years, he has discharged his duty as a director of the board very well. Can I say that I thoroughly endorse what the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday when he said that he was not putting any questions as to his fitness for office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and recognise the enormous contribution that the electorate that she represents makes to Australia's export effort. The member for Riverina would be aware that, in 2004-05, there was a record level of exports out of Australia of $162.3 billion. Some of the products that are produced in the electorate of Riverina made a significant contribution to that figure. Beef exports rose by 24 per cent to $4.8 billion. Lamb exports - and we all remember the dispute we had over lamb exports and tariffs a few years ago - grew by nearly nine per cent last year and now stand at $1.19 billion, which is an enormous amount of growth in recent years, and of course coming from the member's electorate. Dairy exports rose by 9.4 per cent to top $2.36 billion.All this has taken place in a global economic environment that from time to time has been challenging, with an exchange rate that has been higher than it has been in some recent years and in the face of one of the worst droughts that Australia has had in recent years. It is very important that we recognise the great effort and great job that Australia's farmers and exporters do in making a contribution to that export figure.This means increased income for regional Australia and jobs in regional Australia. The member for Riverina knows only too well the importance of flexibility in the labour market, particularly with some of the agricultural and horticultural industries in her electorate of Riverina. The member for Riverina, along with the National Farmers Federation, would recognise the importance of the government's workplace relations reform package that we have before the parliament. The NFF have said that the government's workplace relations reforms are critical for continued economic growth in Australia. The NFF have also said that the flow-on effects from the introduction of the Work Choices package will be a crucial component for our industry to continue to remain competitive.Interestingly, at the Senate inquiry into the Work Choices bill, the NFF stated that Work Choices is the right choice for Australia. The NFF's views are supported by their state based affiliates, including Agforce in Queensland. Agforce believe that the Work Choices reforms will provide an opportunity for wages and conditions to reward individual effort and initiative - that is, to benefit employees, not employers. Agforce went on to say, 'If excessive industrial relations regulations are removed, the flexibility and competitiveness of farming businesses will be increased.' That is something they want to see happen, and they want to see this legislation pass through the parliament.I will leave the last word on this to Peter Corish, the President of the National Farmers Federation. He said, 'It is imperative that the bill is passed before Christmas so that we can get on with the job of educating farmers about the changes and implementing the reforms we have sought for decades.' This government is delivering those opportunities. As I said yesterday, the coalition will continue to work with, and listen to, the job creators in this nation. We know that the Labor Party is tied hand and foot to the job destroyers in this country.</DOC>

 - Without asking all the members of my office, which I am quite happy to do, I cannot vouch for them. But, as I have already told the honourable member, the obligation to give an undertaking as to tax affairs is always that of the appointee. In this case, as in every other case, the appointee was told that he would have to give an undertaking as to his tax affairs. Not only did he do that but he produced a letter from the commissioner as to his tax affairs.As I said yesterday, I do not believe that there are any matters in dispute between Mr Gerard and the Commissioner of Taxation. Indeed, I believe that all outstanding matters are settled. I do not believe that it is wrong for a person to contest a tax audit. There would be thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of Australians who do that. Every Australian has the right, if they do not believe they are being assessed for the proper amount of tax, to contest that in court. The fact that they do that is not wrong; it is not illegal. It is a right that every Australian has. If an Australian goes to a court or contests a tax audit, that is not a blemish on their character. They have every right to do so, whether it be Mr Gerard, members of parliament or other companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform him today that Standard and Poor's have just issued a press release which has reaffirmed Australia's top credit rating - a AAA credit rating. Standard and Poor's say that Australia's AAA rating has been affirmed on solid finances and a robust economy:Public sector finances remain extremely strong in Australia, and the Commonwealth has very low levels of debt and strong commitment to ongoing fiscal discipline.It was not always the case that the Commonwealth had extremely strong finances. We can remember back to 1996. The then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, had the federal budget in deficit by $10 billion. The then finance minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, had racked up Commonwealth debt of $96 billion. Let me also make the point that, back in 1996, Australia did not have a AAA credit rating. In 1996 Australia had been downgraded twice because of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. We were downgraded for the first time in 1986 and for a second time in 1989. It was only after the election of the coalition government that we were upgraded in 1999, and our final upgrade to a AAA rating was in 2003. So it was Labor that ran Australia's credit rating down and it was the coalition that ran it up again.The consequence of that, of course, is lower interest rates, because if Australia were not AAA rated there would be a premium not only on government borrowing but on private companies through the interest rates they pay. I think all Australians would probably welcome the fact that Australia has a AAA credit rating. I have only known of one member of parliament who has complained about the upgrading of Australia's credit rating, and it was the member for Lilley, who complained on 17 February 2003 about Standard and Poor's upgrading Australia to a AAA rating. - His claim at the time was that the credit rating upgrade came 'at the expense of Australian families'. The member for Lilley complained about Australia's credit upgrade. The credit upgrade, notwithstanding the complaints of the member for Lilley, came about because of good economic policy - coalition policy - that is giving all Australians lower interest rates.</DOC>

 - That is absolutely false and I repudiate it in its entirety. The reason the commissioner wrote a letter saying that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard is that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. That is the reason he wrote the letter. The Commissioner of Taxation made it clear that he had no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, he still has no dispute with Mr Gerard. To my knowledge, Mr Gerard did what any taxpayer is entitled to do. You are entitled in Australia to contest a tax audit and, what is more, it was settled to the complete satisfaction of the parties.Robert Gerard has broken no law. Robert Gerard has done what every Australian is entitled to do. Robert Gerard has no outstanding matters with the tax office. Robert Gerard has served on the Reserve Bank board for 2½ years without any complaint. The Australian Labor Party has never made a complaint about his fitness to be a member of that board and nor, to my knowledge, has anybody else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and, in response, say to him that the system of enterprise bargaining in Australia has led to more jobs, higher wages and greater productivity in this country. This is a system which is underpinned by the corporations power in the Constitution. Indeed, in the Work Choices package before the parliament the corporations power will be used to further that system, rather than have the old system that we had in the past based on a system of industrial disputes.The corporations power was first used not by the coalition but by the Labor Party under the leadership of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Indeed, in is second reading speech in 1993 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, said this:The operation of enterprise flexibility agreements will be supported by the use of the corporations power. This removes the requirement for an interstate dispute and makes the arrangements more accessibleThis was not a new idea for the Labor Party. Indeed, as far back as October 1972, in an address to the Metal Trades Industry Association, the then Prime Minister - the then Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam - had also advocated the use of the corporations power for industrial relations in Australia. In the past, Mr Whitlam, Mr Keating and Mr Brereton were all in favour of the use of the corporations power because this enabled the creation of a system based on cooperation rather than a system based on the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which at its core had this bizarre proposition that, to resolve an industrial arrangement, you first had to create an interstate dispute in order to have an arbitration commissioner move in and then resolve that dispute. So the corporations power was strongly advocated by the Labor Party and its leadership in the past. What is the position of the Labor Party today? This was revealed on the Insiders program last Sunday when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed.This is what he said when he was asked about this matter:The theory under which it's imposed, that is, using the corporations power to do industrial relations legislation, that's all wrong. I mean, basically, industrial relations legislation should be done under the conciliation and arbitration power as the founders of this nation determined it should be. So, all of it is wrong. The whole theory of it is wrong. That's why you've got to junk the lot.So we had the Leader of the Opposition say use of the corporations power is all wrong. He went on to say:I mean, basically, industrial relations legislation should be done under the conciliation and arbitration power as the founders of this nation determined it should be.And this is what he finished up by saying:So, all of it is wrong. The whole theory of it is wrong. - So what we have here, whether he intended it or not, is a clear indication that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip up the use of the corporations power, which was advocated by Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating and put in place by Laurie Brereton as industrial relations minister. What that means is this: the consequence of that is not just undoing the reforms that this government has put in place; it is undoing the reforms which the Leader of the Opposition voted for when he was a member of the Keating cabinet. That is what he is doing: he is saying I am going to rip up the reforms which I was partly responsible for in 1993 to bring about a more collective approach in Australia. He wants a system which is based on awards and conflict rather than a system based on cooperation. The consequence of this is not just a rip-up of legislation; it is a rip-off of ordinary Australian workers, because under both collective and individual agreements they earn more. That is what we will be telling the Australian people day in and day out.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his interest in economic policy. The OECD overnight released a very positive economic assessment of Australia's economic outlook. The OECD expects Australia's GDP to grow 2.6 per cent in 2005 and its growth to accelerate to 3.2 per cent in 2006 and 3.6 per cent in 2007. It expects business investment to be underpinned by high company profitability and healthy corporate balance sheets. The ongoing investment boom is expected to make it possible to take advantage of buoyant export markets. In line with that, the OECD expects that the current account deficit will narrow during 2007, forecasting 5.2 per cent. The OECD expects inflation to be affected by higher energy prices - which is also the position of the government - and predicts that underlying inflation will peak at around three per cent in 2006 before easing. So this is a very positive assessment of the Australian economy and, in particular, of the strong Commonwealth government finances underpinned by surplus budgets and low Commonwealth debt.One of the recommendations the OECD makes about how Australia could improve its economy is that there should be 'rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reform'. The OECD is a group of developed economies in the world. There is regular peer assessment. The United States, France, Germany and Japan are all members of it. What does the OECD call for in Australia? Rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reform. So that is what the developed world believes would help Australia. That is what the developed world has called for in Australia. We have the OECD calling for it and we have the IMF calling for it. Practically every economic commentator says industrial relations reform improves flexibility. And who have we got opposing reform in Australia? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, 'Mr Anti-reform' himself, who has stood opposed to every reform that has got Australia to where it is and stands against every reform as to where it wants to go in the future.</DOC>

 - He was certainly appointed in 2003. 
An opposition member - When? - It is on the public record - you can look up the book. I have a statement issued by his solicitors yesterday - which, I note, disputes a lot of what was reported in the Financial Review - which says that settlement was achieved but not as reported in the Australian Financial Review. - It was achieved in late 2003, I believe. I cannot give you the precise date. I do not believe that Mr Gerard would be the only director of a company which would have outstanding matters with the tax office. Without going into the detail, I would be very surprised if there were not other bank directors who have also been associated with public companies or other companies that have contested audits, as they are entitled to do. I repeat, as I have said to the House on many occasions, that every Australian has the right to contest a tax assessment. Every Australian has the right to go to court in respect of a tax assessment. It is no crime to contest a tax assessment. Particularly when the matter is settled without any findings of fact -  - or settled without any findings against the person, there is no adverse implication on that person at all. The fact that a person has settled their affairs with the Australian Taxation Office indicates that the two have come to an agreement. As I said earlier, Mr Gerard has been a valued member of the Reserve Bank board for 2½ years and no-one has suggested that he has not discharged his duties properly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I appreciate the interest she has in this issue. Planning by the Iraqis is going ahead now for general elections to be held on 15 December to elect a new national assembly and indeed to elect a new government in Iraq under the constitution that was approved in October. Our expectation - we obviously do not know for sure - is that the turn-out for that election will be at least as great as the turn-out for the referendum, which was 10 million people. The government has contributed $12 million to the United Nations to support both this election and the referendum in addition to the $5 million we provided to support the first election on 30 January. Australians are also assisting the process, including through the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections.The deputy head of the Australian Electoral Commission - who will no doubt be known to some members - Paul Dacey, is the deputy chairman of the International Mission for the Iraqi Elections. We have supported out-of-country voting in Australia for the 30 January elections, and we will do so again for the elections in December. I am sure the Speaker of the Knesset would agree with that analysis, and how welcome he is here today - he is a very good man. Let me make this point: the advent of democracy in Iraq for the first time is an extraordinary and great thing. On this side of the House we are very proud of the role that we, members of the Australian Defence Force and many officials have played in helping to make that possible. - Our policy on this issue has always been crystal clear. The honourable member for Gilmore asked whether there are any alternatives. The people in my office are probably the only people in Australia who keep tabs on the opposition's policies on Iraq. The House may be interested to know that the opposition has now had 31 different policies on Iraq. The latest one is apparently back to where Mark Latham was - that is, all the troops out. Just as democracy arrives in Iraq and the international community is getting behind the Iraqis and dealing as best as we all can with the insurgents, the opposition - </DOC>

 - As a Queenslander the honourable member for Hinkler will be pleased to learn that, at long last, the Queensland government has signed the AusLink agreement. It has taken a long time but, finally, Queensland has signed up to an agreement that will deliver $2,688 million to Queensland, until 2008-09. This includes $1.864 million under the AusLink investment program and over $1.5 billion for construction. This funding from the Commonwealth government represents an 81 per cent increase in construction funding for roads in Queensland over the five-year period of the agreement. The funding represents a significant advance and a real opportunity to address some of the really important projects in Queensland. The Prime Minister has already announced $550 million in funding under AusLink for the Ipswich Motorway. The member for Groom, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, announced $10 million in funding for the next stage of development in the project in the Toowoomba Range. There is significant funding for the upgrade of the Bruce Highway and for a range of other important projects in the state.Last week I also announced funding for some important rail upgrade projects. The member for Moreton, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, will be particularly interested in the announcement of $25 million in funding for the Acacia Ridge level crossing upgrade. It is a high priority project for the minister. - Yes. He indicated in his election platform that this would be a project he would be pressing for, and now he has delivered. AusLink has enabled these sorts of projects to be delivered. In all, there is $12.7 billion nationally for getting on with the job of upgrading the roads and upgrading the rail systems. Last week the Leader of the Opposition presented what he called the 'blueprint speech' at AusRAIL '05, with regard to the Labor Party's proposals for road and rail upgrading. There were three essential elements. Firstly, he is going to have a national infrastructure audit. AusLink has already done that. We had a public process which identified deficiencies and what we needed to fix them. Secondly, he is going to establish a national infrastructure priority list. AusLink has done that too. We have five years of projects already identified on a 20-year planning scale. Thirdly, he is going to set up a Commonwealth statutory authority to oversight all of this. So instead of action and road building we are going to get another bureaucracy to redo all that AusLink is already doing. We are getting on with the job. Labor will only ever talk and never deliver.</DOC>

 - I would be surprised if that were case because I would be very surprised if the Australian banks are not being subject to audits. I think you ought to recognise the fact that the Australian Taxation Office conducts audits on all major companies in Australia. For most of them I would believe that the Australian banks would have been under tax audit for quite some time. In addition to that, the Australian Taxation Office does audits on all so-called high-wealth individuals, so I think there would hardly be a high-wealth individual in Australia who has not been subject to a tax audit. Most of these tax audits go on for very long periods of time. Without going into the matter, I would be very surprised indeed if the Australian banks had not been subject to tax audits.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Like the rest of the government, he understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system in this country without a strong complementary private health sector too. Support for the private health system has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government, particularly the private health insurance rebate. It is a rebate worth $1,000 a year to the average Australian family with private cover - a rebate which means that nearly nine million Australians now have access to the choice and security that private cover brings, including nearly one million people with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. In the September quarter, nearly 60,000 people took out private insurance, and from tomorrow the government is taking further steps to guarantee that portability of private cover is a reality.I have been asked about alternative policies. So I turn to Labor's forbidden book: the diaries written by the person whom they wanted to be Prime Minister just 12 months ago. -  - That is right, the forbidden book. I read on page 129 that the Leader of the Opposition's former chief of staff says: 'The private health insurance rebate would be one of the first things abolished in any Beazley government.' I read on page 129 that 'the member for Jagajaga despises the rebate and wants to poleaxe it.' Then on page 347, I read that Medicare Gold was 'my plan' - that is to say, Mark Latham's plan - 'for killing the private health insurance rebate'. - 'It required a lot of work, all handled by Gillard' - the would-be assassin of the private health insurance rebate, now interjecting furiously, who said on the Friday when this book first hit the public pages, 'People should not ignore the truths in this book.' The truth that I most liked in this book was on page 112. There Mr Latham says of the Leader of the Opposition: 'A big bellowing cow in parliament will never fool the public' - and haven't we seen plenty of that today!</DOC>

I am also informed by the Attorney-General that it was not referred to any minister and, if I am right - because I assumed you would be asking this question - because there was no letter, there was never a letter referred to the Attorney-General. So that ends that one. Because no matter was ever referred to the Attorney, there was nothing the Attorney could ever raise with me, nor did he.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his interest in the young people of his electorate and the young people of Australia and their financial future. At the last federal election the Howard government announced that we would be establishing the Financial Literacy Foundation - which we subsequently have done and funded to the tune of $5 million a year - to raise awareness amongst the Australian population, young and old, of the significance that financial literacy can make in their lives by providing them with the information and advice they need to be able to make appropriate decisions. I want to commend the Commonwealth Bank on some groundbreaking research that it did which pointed to just how beneficial this work can be. A key finding of the CBA stated:An improvement in financial literacy has the potential to boost Australia's economy by $6,000 million a year with the creation of more than 16,000 new jobs.You can appreciate that these are significant things for the average Australian. The CBA also identified the particular target groups which have the lowest level of financial literacy in Australia. Unfortunately, one of the highest groups represented were young males, aged 16 to 20. The Australian Financial Literacy Foundation and the Master Builders Association here in the ACT have teamed up together to provide the first opportunity for young apprentices in the building field - predominantly young men - to gain, as of March next year, direct financial literacy advice and assistance so they will understand budgeting and how to conduct their own finances. It is quite likely that many of these young men, and some young women, will find themselves in business in four or five years time, adding to the wealth of this nation.It is a well-known fact that apprenticeships were at a 30-year low when the Howard government was elected in 1996, due to the neglect of apprenticeships by those who sit opposite - the Labor Party. It is also a fact that these same apprentices today are more likely to be in full-time employment throughout their life than even those with a tertiary education. It is absolutely essential that they gain the financial literacy skills that they need, so they can make the right decisions in their personal lives and in their business lives. This is what the Financial Literacy Foundation was established to do. It is the start of what is going to be fantastic work, raising the financial literacy standards of all Australians to the benefit of both the individuals and their families and the wider Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. She knows when there is good news pending and there is good news. We want Australians to have the opportunity to get a job. That is what the coalition believes in. The Intergenerational report, released by the Treasurer, properly forecasts that Australia is running out of workers. In fact, over the next 15 years, work force participation is expected to drop by close to four per cent. The coalition recognised that this issue had to be addressed. So we have two approaches. The first one is structural reform, workplace relations reform, which the coalition is absolutely committed to.The second reform is Welfare to Work. It is about providing up to 2.6 million Australians of working age, who may not be working, with the opportunity to get a job. When I first became Minister for Human Services, we approached the Centrelink call centres and asked them for the first time to start ringing people on benefits and ask them, on a voluntary basis, if they were prepared to work - to make a commitment to serve the country by getting a job for a few hours. This was on a voluntary basis. We rang nearly 300,000 people over the last 12 months. One hundred thousand indicated that they were prepared to work, to be referred to the Job Network, and 45,000 have gone into jobs. Forty-five thousand people work on a voluntary basis because we rang them up and asked them if they were prepared to work. It is an even better chart - and we all have to have charts. It is an even better chart, a good chart, a bit like the Qantas symbol - indicating the number of new jobs on a voluntary basis of people who are prepared to work. -  - The Labor Party have a bit of a problem with people getting jobs - we know that. I was flicking through old press releases and I came across one by the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan. It is not that long ago that he said:The coalition is not serious about assisting jobseekers move from welfare to work.How wrong he is: 45,000 people in the last 12 months going into work on a voluntary basis simply because we asked them to do it. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and acknowledge his deep interest in aged care issues in his electorate. Over the past decade, an increasing number of older Australians have sought the delivery of aged care services at home. The Australian government have responded. We have led a quiet revolution in the way aged care services are delivered in this country. We are providing far more choice. We are moving away from the one size fits all mentality that was the hallmark of Labor aged care policy back in the good old days - when Labor had an aged care policy.We are increasing the types of services that are available and we are increasing the availability of those services, and the sheer volume of change speaks for itself. When we came to office there were only 4,000 community aged care packages; today there are 34,000. That means that 34,000 people can receive hostel level care but at home. The Howard government introduced the Extended Aged Care at Home package. There are now 2,700 of these packages. That means people can receive nursing home level care but at home. And we have now introduced another model of care, dementia specific Extended Aged Care at Home, so people living with dementia can stay at home rather than enter a nursing home. This choice is in addition to the increase in residential aged care places that we have introduced to meet the challenges of the ageing of our population.Since coming to office, over 95,000 new aged care places have been allocated and subsidised by the Australian government, and we are well on the way to meeting our target of 200,000 operational aged care places by 30 June 2006. As at June this year, there were a record number - 193,753 - of operational aged care places in Australia. This demand for greater choice seems to have passed Labor by. They do not understand the importance of community care. They do not have an aged care policy to meet this issue. They neglected aged care in government; they have abandoned it in opposition. Meanwhile, this government is getting on with the job of providing world-class care with choice to meet the needs of individual Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Members may be aware that the 42nd annual Australian Export Awards, where the nation recognises the most successful exporters in Australia over the previous 12 months, are on in Sydney tonight. These 12 months have seen a record level of exports reached, with $163.2 billion worth of exports going out of Australia. The award finalists tonight have actually exported $17 billion worth of that total amount. - Some of those finalists are manufacturers. I knew that would excite the front bench on the other side. Some of those finalists are miners, some are agricultural exporters and some are services exporters - obviously. It is interesting to note also that 40 per cent of the entrants in tonight's awards finals are based in regional Australia. This is a demonstration of the important contribution that is made to the export effort by regional Australia and areas like the electorate of Mallee, which the member represents. Of course, our government has been clearly focused on ensuring that there is the best possible economic environment and foundation in Australia from which these businesses can compete in the global marketplace. That is why they have been successful - through their own initiative and the assistance and support of the government.But we want to do more. We want to improve that environment more with the workplace relations reforms that we have proposed. It is interesting to note the comments of some of the most successful Australian exporters with regard to what the government is proposing here. John Casella is the managing director of a great wine company that manufactures Yellow Tail wine near Griffith in the electorate of Riverina. The opposition will be interested to note that 26 million cases of Yellow Tail wine have now been sold into the export market across the world. In dollar terms, the brand is the No. 1 foreign brand in the United States. John Casella said: 'We support the industrial relations reforms because they will provide us with increased flexibility in the workplace, which helps maintain and continue our export initiatives.' That underpins all the jobs that he provides in his business and those businesses that supply him.Another finalist tonight is Hastings Food Processing. They are the ninth largest exporter of value added products out of Australia - a manufacturing industry. They happen to be located in one of those great electorates on the mid North Coast of New South Wales. They are one of tonight's finalists. They have only been going for a while and have increased the employment levels dramatically in that area. They said: 'The government's workplace reforms will help Hastings Food Processing remain internationally competitive and enable us to continue to generate jobs in the Hastings region. We want what is best for our staff and the proposed reforms will assist us to make the most of our employees' individual circumstances.' There is the testimonial of two great Australian exporters supporting the government's reform package that is before the Senate at the moment. The coalition government will continue to work with and support the job creators in this nation. The Labor Party is still hooked onto the job destroyers.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is manifestly no. This legislation is not extreme. The changes relating to unfair dismissal will result in the generation of tens of thousands of more jobs in small business. That is the reason why the government has made this change. That is the reason why the government intends to alter the job-destroying, unfair dismissal provisions that were first put into this law 12 years ago as a result of a secret deal made during the 1993 election campaign between the then Keating government and the ACTU. They are not some sacrosanct right that has existed since Magna Carta. - They have acted as a barrier against job creation. That is why we are changing them. - As a result of these changes there will be tens of thousands of more job opportunities particularly for young Australians, and I am very proud of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question, and I can inform him that the ABS released the balance of payments publication for September 2005 today. The release showed that the current account deficit widened $1.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the September quarter, mainly reflecting an increase in the net income deficit of $1.4 billion, which reflects largely the fact that highly profitable foreign-owned enterprises in Australia remitted earnings back to head offices. The trade deficit was largely unchanged, increasing by $70 million. For the quarter the terms of trade rose by 1.8 per cent to be 12.4 per cent higher through the year, and the terms of trade are now at their highest level since the March quarter of 1974. The ABS is revising the national accounts data so it did not publish percentages, but Treasury estimates are that net foreign debt is around 51 per cent of GDP.In addition to that, private new capital expenditure data was released today, showing that capital expenditure rose 2.9 per cent over the quarter and is 23 per cent higher over the year. Investment in buildings and structures rose 10.1 per cent. Although investment in plant and machinery fell slightly, it is 18.9 per cent higher through the year. So what we see going on here is an incredible business investment surge in Australia. A very big part of that business investment surge will be in the mining industry, and as the terms of trade move in Australia's favour and as mining companies particularly become more profitable you will get a net income deficit as earnings are remitted back offshore. But the good thing about the increase in investment is that this is setting Australia up for future growth opportunities. We have probably not seen a business investment surge of this dimension in this country for a very long period of time, and it is increasing the capacity of the Australian economy. It is also reweighting growth - which was very strong in consumption and in housing activity over the late 1990s to the early part of the 2000s - back into the business sector and increasing Australia's capacity. So as the economy rebalances we find new sources of growth. If we manage to come through the housing cycle with the plateauing of prices and the cooling that we have now seen, with investment picking up Australia can continue to grow - one of the longest continuous growth periods in Australian history. If with further reform we can continue that cycle going, there will be more jobs and more opportunities for Australians to enjoy the fruits of that economic growth.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and for his interest and join with you, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the Lieutenant Governor of California here, because I know that he has an interest in gas and energy and that it is a big issue for California. The final round of negotiations with East Timor over the oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea were completed yesterday evening in Darwin. This was the eighth meeting of our delegations since this phase of the talks began in April 2004. The honourable member for Fadden and other members will be pleased to hear that these negotiations were successful. Officials have now initialled an agreement and exchanged letters on the basis of an agreed text, and I think all members on this side of the House will be very pleased to hear that. The East Timorese Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, and the foreign minister, Jose Ramos Horta, have agreed there will be an official signing ceremony - we hope in the presence of both prime ministers - by mid-January next year.For obvious reasons, I think members will accept that I do not intend to go into the details of the agreement until it has been formally signed - on the day it is formally signed we will release all the details - but, importantly, this is a good deal for both Australia and East Timor. It safeguards Australia's sovereign interests and it will provide investors with the certainty needed for large-scale resource projects to go ahead. The arrangements under the 2002 Timor Sea Treaty, which we negotiated, will remain in place. That means East Timor will continue to get its 90 per cent share of the revenues from the production of the joint development area. At current oil prices, revenues from that area alone could deliver around $US14.5 billion to East Timor over the next 20 years, averaging around $US2 million per day.In conclusion, I am very pleased to say that East Timor has set up a petroleum fund to ensure the prudent management of its petroleum wealth. I know that many members are concerned about the economic plight of East Timor, so they will be pleased to hear that the balance of that fund has already reached $300 million. The fund builds on international best practice for transparency and accountability and it should ensure the sustainable management of East Timor's resources wealth well into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am a little surprised that he would ask the question, given the widespread knowledge, endorsement and acceptance by industry and rural communities of our 2020 Vision strategy for forestry plantations, which is set to treble the volume of plantation timber over the next 20 years to meet the burgeoning needs of the Indian and Chinese markets. By 2010, China will have a need for 137 million cubic metres of timber. By that time, Australia hopefully will be producing some 37 million cubic metres, of which 10 million cubic metres will be available for export. By the year 2020, India will be the third largest economy after China and America. So India and China are two great opportunities, but we cannot just jump on the bandwagon. We have to tailor our market by way of research and development, promotion and marketing to meet their needs and carve out export opportunities. The government and the forestry industry have been in a long-term partnership. We have a strategy and a vision which we are backing with resources. 
 -  - I am asked by the opposition: what is it? Firstly, they should know about the 2020 Vision, particularly the opposition spokesman who only yesterday addressed the National Association of Forest Industries 20th anniversary conference and committed the opposition to a reversal of its previous environment and timber policies - but more about that another day. In answer to the member for New England and opposition interjections, I am happy to supply a copy of the 2020 Vision strategy to anybody who requests it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. The government's economic policies have now delivered an extraordinary period of economic growth in Australia, with 1.7 million new jobs being created since 1996. In addition to that, real household wealth has doubled since March 1996 and the standard variable home loan rate, at around 7.3 per cent, is a far cry from what it was under the Australian Labor Party, when home mortgage interest rates peaked at 17 per cent per annum. In addition to that, the government introduced a First Home Owners Scheme $7,000 grant to help first home buyers, which has now assisted around 760,000 Australians. I repeat: 760,000 Australians have been able to access that first home buyers grant.I regret to inform the House that all of this could well be under attack from the Australian Labor Party. Apparently, Senator Carr, who is a shadow minister of some form or description in the Labor Party, is today announcing a new housing agenda calling for a redesign of the First Home Owners Scheme. The plan is to deny such a scheme to people who build large houses in the outer suburbs in electorates such as Greenway, Macarthur or La Trobe - the so-called 'McMansions'. The plan apparently calls for educating families that big houses in the suburbs are bad for the environment. There are a lot of Australians who like having a home in the suburbs. There are a lot of Australians who choose to live in homes in the suburbs because they like having land and backyards, children and room for them to grow - they actually choose it. As I recall, the immediate predecessor of the current Leader of the Opposition believed this ought to be a heartland for the Australian Labor Party.These people are not only voting with their bankbooks when they go and live in the suburbs; they have been voting in electoral ballots for the party that supports the suburbs and housing in Australia, which are the Liberal and National parties. Fiona Allon, a fellow at the University of Western Sydney, warned against this plan yesterday. She said:Families in bigger outer suburban houses could find a re-education campaign patronising.Can't you see Senator Carr and the Labor Party calling people in from the suburbs for a re-education campaign as to why they should not be living in the suburbs and shouldn't be living in these houses -  - and probably giving them a re-education campaign on how they should be voting and telling them they should be living in terrace houses in inner suburbs and voting for the Australian Labor Party? No doubt that is what the Labor Party has in mind. I think it is pretty clear that the Liberal and National parties represent the aspirational people of the suburbs of Australia. They are entitled to choose their housing and they are entitled to their first home grant, and this is the party that will look after those people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I can indicate to him that, this week, the OECD reaffirmed its support for further workplace relations reform, urging 'rapid implementation of the planned industrial relations reforms'. Yesterday, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry released a position paper entitled 'The economic case for workplace relations reform', in which they said: 'We cannot afford to be tied down by a workplace relations system that is not responsive to economic circumstances, limits the potential benefits of agreement making, encourages industrial disputes, restricts the employment of many Australians without work and ties too many working Australians to minimum award wages.'These endorsements in the last day and the last week are in addition to those we have previously seen from the IMF, the Reserve Bank and the Productivity Commission. Indeed, earlier this year Access Economics in its report 'Locking in or losing prosperity' predicted that the economy would grow by four per cent per annum rather than by 2.4 per cent if further economic reforms, including industrial relations reform, were implemented and that the GDP per person would be 31 per cent higher. In June this year the Governor of the Reserve Bank argued this: 'I think industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth, and the reform that's been undertaken to date, although it has disappointed a lot of people, has I think had a quite profound effect. It's meant that the economy can run faster without generating inflationary influences, to the extent that used to be the case. So I think there's undoubtedly value in industrial relations reform.'So we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the International Monetary Fund, a leading economic research organisation such as Access Economics, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia arguing the case for further economic reform and, in particular, further reform of the workplace relations system in Australia. The reality is that the only organisation which is out of step with this argument is the Australian Labor Party. We had the Leader of the Opposition saying in April this year: 'Howard' - this is the Prime Minister - 'now talks about industrial relations. Really that's puerile; the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry.' We do not support that proposition because, as the OECD, the IMF, Access Economics, the Productivity Commission and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia have all argued, as the Productivity Commission said in a recent report, 'These reforms could mean an increase in the wealth of ordinary Australian households of up to $22,000.' That is something worth pursuing.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Tangney, and can I say how pleased I am with his question. I also take the opportunity of acknowledging in the public gallery today the 12 members of the Australian Defence Force 1st Military Police Battalion, who provided close personal protection to a number of members of a parliamentary delegation that visited Iraq in October. Their leader is Captain Kurt Black-Sinclair, and we are delighted to see them all here today. 
Honourable members - Hear, hear! - Many countries are supporting Iraq as it marches towards democracy - Australia, the United States, Great Britain, Italy, NATO more generally, South Korea, Japan and even Fiji and Mongolia. Middle East countries are increasingly coming on board. Jordan is providing support for its International Police Training Centre, which the Australian Federal Police contribute to. Indeed, democratic processes are gradually at work throughout the Middle East.President Bush made a speech early this morning our time setting out the United States and their allies' strategy for victory in Iraq over the insurgents and the terrorists. I commend that speech to honourable members. We want to see victory in Iraq, and we are confident that it will happen. Firstly, the President has identified very clearly who the enemy in Iraq is, and it is very clear who the enemy isn't. The enemy is not the vast majority of the Iraqi people who want democracy and freedom just as most other people around the world desperately want it. Secondly, what the President shows is what the world can offer to Iraq: democracy, improving capabilities and the effectiveness of security forces, rebuilding infrastructure and helping to reform the economy. President Bush also demonstrated American resolve when he said, 'As the Iraqi security forces stand up, coalition forces can stand down, but pulling our troops out before they have achieved their purpose is not a plan for victory.' President Bush also said, 'America will not run in the face of car bombers and assassins.' They are words that on this side of the House we can very much endorse.Are there other alternatives? There are of course our old friends in the Labor Party who have offered an alternative - an alternative of cut and run, which is still the policy that they stick to. -  - The fact is - as the interjections, particularly from left-wing members of the Labor Party make only too clear - we know from the ANU's Candidate Study, which outlines the responses of 530 candidates who stood in last year's election, that only 40 per cent of Labor candidates said that the alliance was very important to our security. Within the Labor Party there are substantial elements which harbour a visceral anti-Americanism and, on this side of the House, there is an unequivocal view that we support freedom and democracy in Iraq and we oppose the insurgents and the terrorists who are ruthlessly killing the Iraqi people. We are unequivocal in our support -  -  - and we do not support, like the Labor Party and its lefties who are interjecting now, a policy of cut and run.</DOC>

 - The second part of the question is absolutely false. The declaration that Mr Gerard was asked to provide to the government was the same declaration that every other member of the Reserve Bank board is asked to give to the government. What is more, it is the same declaration that every other member of the Reserve Bank board who was appointed by the Labor Party was asked to provide. And, as far as I know, it is the same declaration that every High Court judge, every Federal Court judge, every ACCC commissioner, every APRA appointee -  - and every Commonwealth appointee is required to provide. Nothing different was done in relation to Mr Gerard than was done in relation to every other Commonwealth appointee, and the suggestion that somehow a form was tailored for him - which is a standard form and which has been used on thousands of occasions - should be completely and utterly repudiated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and his support for the government's Work Choices legislation. The Work Choices bill maintains and strengthens the prohibitions against discrimination and dismissal of employees on the grounds of whether or not they are a member of a union. In fact, it also remains unlawful for employers to victimise employees who are not union members. That is clearly set out in the legislation. I was asked about some alternative views and I came across a firm that does not seem to support the engagement and employment of union members. Indeed, in its original prospectus, when it was floated, it boasted: 'None of our employees is represented by a labour union.' Its annual return for 1999 boasted: 'We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees is represented by a Labor union.'Indeed I understand the practice of this firm is that it only employs people on individual contracts. The 2000 annual report of this firm is interesting because it says, in part:We had approximately 690 employees as of December 31, 2000. However, in January 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in staff reductions of 172 employees.They are boasting of having slashed the work force between 31 December 2000 and the beginning of January 2001. The very interesting thing is that this 2000 annual report goes on to state:Our future success depends, in part, on the continued service of our key management personnel, particularly Evan Thornley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Ellery, our President. Mr. Thornley and Ms. Ellery are husband and wife.These are the people who boast about not employing union members that the Leader of the Opposition appointed to his Knowledge Nation task force back in the year 2000. This is what the Federal Secretary of the ALP, Mr Tim Gartrell, said about Mr Thornley:He is a great supporter of the Labor Party.He said:The Labor Party has an obligation to weed out any existing duds and replace them with the next generation of leadership, the thinkers, the reformers, the persuaders.He says that Mr Thornley is:... an energetic highly intelligent guy who understands industry policy and economics and can argue his case at any forum. They are the sort of people that we need.I wonder what the member for Scullin thinks about that. This bloke will not employ a unionist in his business. So here we have the modern face of the Labor Party in Australia. One of its up-and-coming stars will not deal with unions, will not employ union members, engages in a mass sacking of staff and prefers individual contracts. This is a man who is practising the very thing that the Labor Party says is exploitative. I assure members of the Labor Party and the other members of the House that we, at least on this side of politics, will stand up for the Australian worker.</DOC>

 - Mr Gerard has put out a statement about that allegation in the Australian Financial Review today and I would refer all members to that statement in which he makes it clear that no income has been derived. - What is more, if any income is derived in a controlled foreign corporation, it is taxable in Australia. I would refer members opposite, if they are interested in the facts, to Mr Gerard's statement. No doubt the member for Lilley has read it because he referred to it earlier, but the facts will not stop the member for Lilley trying to engage, under parliamentary privilege, in smearing people. That is a matter for Mr Gerard to answer. He has already made a statement in relation to that and that statement is on the public record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question and for his interest in these matters. I think all members would be very concerned about high-profile economic targets in Australia. The fact is that the lessons learned from September 11 in the United States and the more recent attacks in Bali and London only reinforce the very proper view that terrorists deliberately pursue high-profile targets, such as buildings in densely populated areas, with the intent of causing maximum destruction and reduction of economic activity, as well as taking the lives of innocent men, women and children.Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that a similar attack could not occur here in Australia. ASIO's most recent annual report warned that attacks in Australia are feasible and could well occur without warning. There are a number of ways in which you can address that issue. The first is to bunker down, turn everything off and turn your cities into fortresses, but that is neither practicable nor desirable. The cost would be prohibitive and it would, of course, destroy much of the amenity that we take for granted here in Australia. Nevertheless, we do need to take every reasonable step available to protect ourselves and that is why we are working very closely with the private sector on national security issues. This close cooperation was demonstrated last week at a summit held in Sydney with Australia's property industries to look at the unique role that they have and to help them in their role of protecting Australians from potential terrorism involving their iconic buildings.Together we share a responsibility to maintain the safety and security of all Australians, and that includes protecting people in their workplaces, in shopping centres, sporting venues, iconic buildings, places of entertainment and, more generally, places of mass gathering. I want to express my thanks to the members of the Property Council for their enthusiastic participation. I want to thank Steven Lowy particularly for hosting the summit and for continuing the excellent dialogue that already exists through other mechanisms in dealing with these issues. It was important to bring all of the industry together to talk about these issues. They saw it as being a very valuable opportunity, as did I. The exercise reinforced in my mind the genuine partnership that exists between government and the business community in protecting the Australian community and our critical infrastructure in particular.</DOC>

 - Again, the allegations that have been put against Mr Gerard have been fully answered by him in his statement, and I refer members to the statement. Can I say in relation to the OECD that this government has sought tax and information-sharing treaties with all countries around the world, including non-OECD countries. As a consequence of those treaties, the Australian taxation authorities do have the access to the material that they need to enforce two sets of regimes. The first is the controlled foreign corporations regime, and the second is the foreign investment fund regime - both of which mean that income which is derived by Australians in relation to -  - the Australian jurisdiction is taxable under that legislation. Information in relation to that is available under tax treaties where Australia has been very active in seeking such assistance.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Canning and indeed other Western Australian members will be pleased that, at long last, Western Australia has agreed to join the AusLink agreement. It has been a long battle, and there has been a malicious and vicious campaign of at least $200,000 mounted by the Western Australian government against the members for Canning, Forrest and Tangney, against this agreement, but finally the Western Australian government has come to the table and money can start to flow to Western Australia. The member for Canning and his colleagues can feel very proud that they stood firm and, as a result, there will be $170 million worth of Commonwealth money to enable the Peel deviation and Kwinana Freeway extension project to proceed.Because they were firm, this project will now be constructed as a seamless project to commence in 2006, to be sufficiently complete to allow the opening of the Peel deviation and freeway extension in 2009. This is a good deal for Western Australia. It represents a 90 per cent increase in construction funding from the Commonwealth over the previous five years - a 90 per cent increase - and that means $472 million for construction and $632 million overall for AusLink in Western Australia. - Quite a bit for rail; quite a bit, in fact -  - I am happy to report that in fact close to $40 million has been provided for rail projects in Western Australia. The member for Kalgoorlie and the member for O'Connor -  The member for Swan then left the chamber. 
 - He misses the good news that $40 million is being provided especially for projects in Western Australia for rail, including: the provision of 76 kilometres of concrete sleepers on the track between Kalgoorlie and Perth; a significant upgrading of the rail loop between Kewdale and Kalgoorlie; in addition to that, $11.5 million, which the member for Hasluck will be interested in, with the Roe Highway Great Eastern upgrade; and also of course the improvements to the Daddow Road level crossing in Kewdale. These are issues that will make a big difference to rail transport in Western Australia.Western Australia has also agreed that talks should be initiated on the future management of the interstate track between Kalgoorlie and Perth. If those talks are successful, along with similar discussions in Queensland, for the first time Australia will have a seamless rail traffic regime from Perth to Brisbane, putting to an end the infamous state border rail barriers that have been a cross for our nation's transport system for so many years. We are making good progress. Congratulations to the Western Australian members on standing firm and therefore ensuring that we have got a good deal for Western Australia that will deliver significant benefits for rail and road transport in that large state.</DOC>

 - I am aware of reports today concerning the granting of a temporary protection visa to Mr al-Tekriti, who, it is alleged, was a member of Saddam Hussein's special security service. I am concerned about these reports and I have made some inquiries of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs concerning the background of the case and any further options which may be available and, when I have further advice, I will be very happy to inform the House.Thus far, these inquiries have revealed that Mr al-Tekriti is an Iraqi citizen who arrived unlawfully by boat on 6 December 1999. He was initially denied a visa by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in September 2000 on the basis of admissions Mr al-Tekriti made to Immigration officials about his membership of Saddam Hussein's special security service. Those admissions, I am told, were subsequently denied by Mr al-Tekriti. That decision by the department of immigration to deny Mr al-Tekriti a visa was overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is the relevant body for reviewing decisions made by DIMIA as to whether an individual should be excluded from protection because of suspected crimes against humanity. Based on Mr al-Tekriti's evidence to the tribunal, that tribunal found in the following terms:The applicant - Mr al-Tekriti - at no point in time has held a position within the Iraqi regime which was involved directly or indirectly in any crimes which could in any way be said to be against humanity or non-political, or of any acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.The government lodged an appeal against this decision, but later withdrew that appeal following advice received from senior counsel that an appeal of this decision was unlikely to succeed as a question of law. This is an important point. The basis for Mr al-Tekriti's grant of a visa was a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal - not the department of immigration - that he could not be denied a protection visa on the grounds the department had sought to refuse him - that is, because, in their view, he was a member of that special security service. The AAT's finding to the contrary was that at no time did he hold a position within the Iraqi regime which was involved directly or indirectly in any crimes which could in any way be said to be against humanity.That decision of the AAT has influenced and underwritten subsequent decisions, including the decision to grant him a temporary protection visa on 21 June 2005. As I have indicated, I am seeking some further information and advice from the minister as to whether any options are appropriately available. But let me conclude by saying that, with respect to the critical decision to overturn the department's refusal of the visa - in other words, the department did not want to give him a visa - Mr al-Tekriti, in exercising his rights, went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned that decision by the department. I would say to any gathering critics of the government on this issue that they cannot have it both ways: they cannot demand a transparent process when it suits them but, when it does not, criticise that transparent process on political grounds.</DOC>

 - No, I am not saying that. I have said repeatedly in this parliament that I told Mr Gerard that his tax affairs would have to be in order if he was to be considered, that he would have to declare that, that he did declare that, that he declared that his tax affairs were in order, that the government was not apprised of any of the material that was published in the Australian Financial Review, that the matters that were in the Australian Financial Review were not brought to the government's attention until they were published in the Australian Financial Review, that the government had no knowledge of those matters from any source at all and that Mr Gerard gave an undertaking as to his affairs - the same undertaking which every Reserve Bank board member is asked to give, which every Reserve Bank board member has given. It is the same undertaking which the Commissioner of Taxation himself gives before he is actually appointed as Commissioner of Taxation. It is an undertaking given by the person themselves who is the person who knows what the state of their tax affairs is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. In answering the question, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a family that has made an enormous contribution to Australian agriculture and more recently to the Australian beef industry. I refer to some former constituents of the member for Mallee, Peter and Angela Menegazzo, who were tragically killed in a plane crash last Friday outside of Condobolin. Peter Menegazzo and his family have made a remarkable contribution to agriculture in Australia, particularly in the produce and beef cattle industries. He was the nation's biggest potato producer and the third largest beef cattle producer in Australia, operating in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. I am sure that everybody in this place expresses their condolences to the family of Peter and Angela. They will be sadly missed. The hard work and success of the Menegazzo family and other rural businesses, and the gutsy way Peter Menegazzo made investments throughout Australia in the rural industries that he engaged in, have been vital to the improved employment opportunities in rural Australia, and it is an absolute tragedy that their lives were cut short.But the member for Mallee asked primarily about the Australian beef industry and its contribution to exports. Of course, our beef industry is one of the great success stories of our rural exporting industries, where the beef industry in 2004-05 increased its exports by 24 per cent to a record value of $4.9 billion - almost $5 billion worth of beef products exported out of Australia - with a record one million tonnes exported. Of course, in that year, we set a record in the Japanese market by dominating that market, where almost 90 per cent of all the imported beef in Japan in that year came from Australia. Of course, while we have been in office since 1996, we have continued with our objective of creating and sustaining an economic environment that is conducive to developing and growing these businesses and in particular their competitiveness internationally. We will continue to work with these industries to enhance their opportunities and to ensure that they remain competitive and that they remain productive in the common circumstance.It is ironic: today is the 20th anniversary of the day when in Darwin in the Northern Territory Justice Morling reconvened the Federal Court in the hearing of the Mudginberri damages case in the beef industry. It was the beginning of a process that ultimately led to the endgame which was to see the full bench of the Federal Court two weeks later find that the Commonwealth has an absolute obligation to supply export inspection services to meat export works which comply with the law. Mr Speaker, you might ask why the Commonwealth would not want to supply export meat inspection services to help exporting industries. That was the case at the time, and that is exactly what the Hawke-Keating government in 1995 had done to prevent a small abattoir from entering into flexible working arrangements and agreeing to end the unit tally system, one of the meat industry's most appalling work to rule award conditions.Following the passage of the Work Choices legislation last Friday, that circumstance is a thing of the past. Under Work Choices, employers will immediately gain access to common-law remedies in the courts to deal with unlawful industrial action, and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have to determine an application to stop unprotected industrial action within 48 hours. All parties to an industrial dispute are now required to meet acceptable standards of behaviour and must not be able to avoid the rule of law. With this legislation passing at the end of last week, we have ensured Australia will have fair, practical and sensible laws supporting Australian workplaces in the interests of employers and employees. As we have continued to say, this continues our government's commitment to improve productivity, create more jobs and increase living standards for all Australian families. We have demonstrated that our government is committed to working with the job creators in Australia to create a better economic environment and a better workplace for employees and employers, whilst we continue to see the focus of the Labor Party just to work with the job destroyers in the community.</DOC>

 - The tax commissioner did no such thing. As to matters in the South Australian Supreme Court, as I understand the situation, there were matters on the file which were never put to court and, as such, are in fact not on the public record. I would not want to take my chances on the legal question, but that is in fact what I am advised. Seeing as the tax commissioner did not give any advice to the government, nor did Mr Gerard give any advice to the government, now the opposition says, 'Oh, well, of course, you should have been down at the registries checking through all of the court cases, because everybody knew all about this particular incident.' Let me say: if everybody knew, why wasn't it until last week that the Australian Financial Review reported it? If everybody knew, why didn't the opposition raise it three years ago?Mr Rob Gerard has been on the Reserve Bank for three years. Far from everybody knowing over the last three years, it is claimed that nobody knew over the last three years. That is the evidence. I can rest assured that, if somebody had known, the opposition would have raised it a long time before now.</DOC>

 - Can I say that, with continued growth in the Australian economy, unemployment is now at or around its lowest level since 1976 at 5.2 per cent. Since this government was elected, 1.7 million new jobs have been created in Australia. However, there are still 750,000 children living in jobless households. If we want to do something for the children who are living in jobless households, we ought to be focusing on allowing parents who are in jobless households to get into the work force and encouraging them to move from welfare to work. The best kind of help for someone on welfare is to arrange for them to get the opportunity of a job. This is what this government believes in: job opportunities for Australians. That is why this government is reforming the welfare to work system, to give people the opportunity to move from welfare into work.I am asked a question about family tax benefits. Can I say that per child under 13 years the family tax benefit is $4,200 a year; for a child aged 13 to 15 years it is $5,150 per year. A family with one child between 13 and 15 and two under that age would be receiving in family tax benefits around $17,000 per annum to help with the raising of those children. In addition to that, a single-income family would be entitled to family tax benefit B, which is part of that $17,000, and a low-income family, approximately another $13,000 as parenting payment. That is $17,000 in family tax benefit A and B and, in addition to that, around $13,000 of parenting payment. Let me make this point: that $17,000 of family tax benefit is for the benefit of the children. It is targeted for the benefit of the children: to pay for their education, for their clothing - for the things that they need. We believe that it is families and parents that can look after those children the best. There will be occasions when those in receipt of family tax benefit, for one reason or another, are not able to properly expend it or look after their children. In those circumstances there ought to be an option for a grandparent or other significant other in the family to receive those payments to look after those children.Noel Pearson, who has been campaigning very strongly on this issue for a very long period of time, has advocated that in Aboriginal communities there be a new opportunity for a responsible adult to receive income on behalf of children. Just recently he said on PM:And if there's an irresponsible adult who's receiving income on behalf of children or on behalf of a disabled person, if that person is irresponsible and is using their income to drink or to gamble, I say the income should be taken off that person's responsibility and placed into the hands of a more responsible family member or a responsible community agency.Noel Pearson is probably one of the most serious Indigenous thinkers in Australia today. That is a recommendation that he is making. I believe there is enormous sense in that recommendation, because family tax benefits are for the benefit of children. Overwhelmingly, when they are paid to parents that is for the benefit of children, but in those cases where the parent, for one reason or another, is not looking after the child it stands to reason that in order to help the child there should be alternatives.</DOC>

After going through the formalities, since we were looking for somebody who is a manufacturer, preferably from outside Sydney or Melbourne, I think I would have said to him, 'What about Mr Rob Gerard?' And I have never seen such an enthusiastic response in all my life. Having had such an enthusiastic response, the next thing we did was to go into cabinet. We said to the cabinet, 'What about Mr Rob Gerard?'I do not want to gild the lily but all of the South Australian cabinet ministers started swinging from the rafters saying, 'What a wonderful idea it is to have a South Australian on the Reserve Bank board!'

 - I thank another great South Australian, the honourable member for Barker, for his question. When he sees these IR changes he will be swinging from the rafters too - you wait! The Australian government's industrial relations changes have been warmly welcomed by business. On 2 December, after the passing of those changes, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry put out a statement saying that the passage of the reform legislation is a historic step forward for Australia. I think on this side of the parliament we would agree with that.Australian Business Limited had this to say:This is a significant day for Australia. A national workplace relations system has long been seen as central to reforming Australia's workplace relations.The Business Council of Australia welcomed the planned changes, with Mr Hugh Morgan saying:We believe workplace reform is a key element in maintaining the economic ...The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia is also a supporter of the government's reforms. Sensis Business Index found support amongst small business - two to one in favour of the government's reform. The National Farmers Federation also urged passage of the workplace reforms. So with all of that business support - every business organisation, to a man or woman - coming out in favour of those IR changes, I must say I was very, very surprised to hear someone on TV on Sunday suggesting that there is not strong support in the business community for the government's IR. He went on to say:Many in the business community are at best ambivalent about these reforms ...If ambivalence is six organisations, to a man, supporting this, I would hate to see what opposition began to look like. All of the business organisations in Australia know that this has to be done. All of those people who believe we need to lift productivity in the Australian community support it. It is only the Labor Party and the member for Lilley - who was out gilding the lily on Sunday - who claim there is not strong support in the business community for these proposals. If Labor wants to rebuild its credibility in the business community, Labor ought to be supporting these IR reforms and getting on with lifting productivity in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and for his interest. He will be interested to know that I asked our ambassador accredited to North Korea, Alan Thomas, who is also the resident ambassador in Beijing, to visit Pyongyang, which he did between 29 November and 3 December. This was the first senior official visit from Australia since I myself visited North Korea in August of last year. While he was there the ambassador met with not only ministers and senior officials but non-government organisation representatives as well. The ambassador essentially had two tasks while he was in Pyongyang. The first was to reaffirm to the North Koreans Australia's view that the six-party talks should not only progress but lead to North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons program and the second to say that we are deeply concerned about a decision made by the North Korean leadership to eject from North Korea by 31 December humanitarian aid workers and to deny the provision of any humanitarian aid to the people of North Korea.On the six-party talks, the North Koreans remained of the opinion that they wanted to keep their nuclear weapons for the time being - and obviously Australia would urge them to commit to abandoning those programs. Also, the North Koreans have made it clear that they have an objection to various financial sanctions that are being put in place to stop illicit trade of one kind or another. Secondly, in terms of the humanitarian aid workers, the North Koreans have made it clear that they wish to see an end to all humanitarian aid by 31 December. NGOs that the ambassador spoke to were very pessimistic about the consequences of this decision. They believe it could have a devastating impact on the people of North Korea, who, despite a reasonably good harvest recently, certainly do not have enough food to provide for the whole of the country, and there is no indication in North Korea that significant economic reform is under way.I want to make it clear that Australia is one of those countries that provide humanitarian assistance to North Korea. We urge North Korea to change its policy, to allow humanitarian assistance to continue to be provided to the people of that country, who are undergoing enormous hardship as a result of the policies pursued by the leadership in North Korea. I hope that the ambassador's representations while he is there will have had some impact on the thinking of the leadership of North Korea in terms of abandoning its nuclear program through negotiations in the six-party talks process. I also hope that it will reverse its decision to stop all humanitarian assistance on 31 December.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question as I am always delighted to get a question in this place about industrial relations. I inform the House that at about 6 pm last Friday the Senate passed the government's Work Choices bill. That decision came after some 22 hours of debate here in the House - more than any other bill since 1996 other than the stem cell legislation - and some 32 hours in the Senate, which is the equivalent of some three whole weeks of Senate legislative business.This package of legislation represents the government's reform agenda since 1996. Indeed, since the 1996 Workplace Relations Act the government has put forward some 58 bills relating to further workplace relations reform. The government has argued for further reform over the last nine years and, indeed, in the last three elections. So nobody in Australia could be in doubt about the government's intention to further reform workplace relations for the good of Australia.That, of course, stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party. Most Australians are still unaware of what the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party stand for. For example, last week the Australian Labor Party voted against a simpler system of workplace relations. They voted against a single national system of workplace relations. They even voted against improved protections for outworkers in Australia. - In updating the House on this legislation, the reality is that last Friday in the Senate the Australian Labor Party was prepared to vote against improved and increased protections for some of the most vulnerable workers in Australia, namely the outworkers. That is an indication of the total lack of policy development undertaken by the Australian Labor Party over the last 10 years and the fact that nobody in Australia knows what this Leader of the Opposition or the opposition stand for.</DOC>

I can inform him that, since the government announced its Tough on Drugs strategy in November 1997, it has committed some $1 billion to drug education, drug rehabilitation and, most importantly, drug law enforcement. The results show that the war on drugs is not doomed to be lost, especially if policy is based on a clear understanding that there is no safe way to use illicit drugs.Since 1999, heroin deaths have declined by some 300 per cent. The number of Australians who report that they have used illicit drugs has dropped from 22 per cent to 15 per cent since 1998. Since 1998, the number of people who regularly use heroin has dropped by 12,000. The number of people who regularly use marijuana has dropped by 180,000, which is just as well because there is increasing evidence of the clear links between marijuana use and subsequent serious mental illness. A 2002 British Medical Journal article found that heavy cannabis use increased the risk of schizophrenia sixfold. In 2001 an American Journal of Psychiatry article found that cannabis use increased the risk of depression fourfold. Last year a Sydney university paper found that regular cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in suicidal behaviour and psychotic illnesses.I can inform the House that this year the government has spent some $13 million on a campaign against the use of illicit drugs. I would ask the states to be careful lest any moves towards further decriminalisation of marijuana should send precisely the wrong message about something which has the potential to be a very dangerous drug indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government place the greatest priority and importance on policing our northern waters. To date in 2005, 233 illegal fishing vessels have been seized and the government have invested $180 million to deter illegal fishing in our northern waters. At the same time, we have used a multi-agency approach - the latest example, in October, being Operation Clearwater II, which involved Customs, Coastwatch, AFMA, the Federal Police and state bodies.The message has been very strong to illegal fishers that they risk severe penalties, including prosecution and the loss of their catch, their fishing equipment and even their vessel. It is a very strong message that we are taking to a number of the Indonesian fishing villages from whence these vessels originate. I would caution the honourable member against using figures of 10,000 or 11,000 sightings of vessels because there are often multiple sightings; there are a number of vessels transiting in Australian waters. That is in no way to diminish the seriousness of the problem or the commitment in energy and resources the government is bringing to solve it.The member asked me about GBRMPA. My view is that it is largely a scientific organisation. Its data, unless there is some exceptional reason, should be available. Transparency and accountability are required for GBRMPA, as they are for any other government business agency, so I will make inquiries. If there is no reason that that information is not available, it should be.Turning now to the allegation of the United States overfishing, Senator Ian Macdonald is an outstanding fisheries minister. He is responsible for a $220 million structural adjustment package that has been universally welcomed by the fishing industry far and wide. It has as its centrepiece $150 million for a one-off, capped buy-out focused on reducing excess fishing capacity in those Commonwealth managed fisheries. The member raises a point about internationally managed fisheries that are excluded from the package, so his criticisms of Senator Macdonald are utterly ill conceived with regard to the structural adjustment package and unfair overall.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck very much for the question and say how much I appreciate the interest of the member in serious issues. The Iraqis will be going to the polls, as many members on this side know, on 15 December to elect a new national assembly. There are 307 political entities registered for the election, contesting 275 seats. Given that it is a regionally based election, there are 230 seats which are divided amongst 18 governorates in proportion to the numbers registered in each province. So the results are likely to be different - for a number of reasons - from the results of the election which was held back on 30 January, which was a whole-of-nation election.Honourable members on this side of the House will be pleased to hear that 15½ million Iraqis have registered to vote in these elections. Australia, as I mentioned last week, is providing support for that democratic process, including for out-of-country voting for Iraqis who reside here in Australia. That includes providing an electoral adviser. It is expected that the 11,000 people in Australia who are eligible to vote in Iraq will vote, so the voting here in Australia is not insignificant. There will be new polling centres in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane in addition to the ones in Sydney and Melbourne which were previously provided. It is another illustration of the very strong commitment the government has to democracy in Iraq and to ensuring that that country is able to achieve, in the long term, a peaceful, democratic and free future. Likewise, we have taken the same view with Afghanistan.Are there any alternatives? The alternative to the policy that we are pursuing in relation to Iraq is the 31st policy that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. In an interview with Mike Carlton, the interviewer of choice for the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition said that the government should withdraw our troops from Iraq - very much a reflection of what his predecessor said. The point is the Labor Party believes that we should have troops in Afghanistan in order to support the evolving democracy in that country - and I agree with that, of course - but the Labor Party does not believe we should keep troops in Iraq to support the emerging democracy and to get the terrorists in that country. If anyone can work out the logic of that -  - If the Labor Party had its way, Saddam would be still in power - he would still be there - so I am not sure who his mate is. I conclude with this point: if anyone on this side of the House can work out the logic of supporting democracy and fighting terrorism in Afghanistan but wanting to cut and run in Iraq, I would like to know what it is. But I will tell you what, Mr Speaker: it has got quite a lot to do with the fact that, in the candidates surveyed by the ANU, 40 per cent of Labor Party people - and only 40 per cent - thought the American alliance was important.</DOC>

 - As has been made perfectly clear, this government always has and always will expect the department to make lawful decisions based on due process. As the Prime Minister has already pointed out, that is exactly what happened in the case of Mr al-Tekriti. The member for Watson cannot have it both ways. He cannot have the department taking people out of Australia where the prosecution clearly gives them a legal onus to do so -  - and at the same time want Australia to put people out when there is no legal right to do so. As we have shown, the department is making legal decisions based on due process, and that is the way it will remain.</DOC>

 - As has been made perfectly plain, there is a very distinct lawful process under which Mr al-Tekriti and others have been dealt with. It is very obvious that once the AAT made a decision that Mr al-Tekriti had to be dealt with under due process, that was done. The member for Watson needs to look at it and realise that we are dealing with a migration process that was done totally lawfully and with total due process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. Members may be aware that this morning the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the figures for October, which indicated that on a seasonally adjusted basis Australia's exports rose by two per cent and imports rose by one per cent. The one per cent rise in imports was substantially in capital goods - in other words, business investing for the future. This is a great result, and in the month of October Australia's exports reached a level of $15 billion for the month. That is the second highest level on record for any month, particularly the month of October.Driving growth in October was an increase in non-rural and other goods, including manufactured exports, which rose by $330 million to $9.9 billion. Rural goods exports also rose in October - by $20 million to a monthly output figure of $2 billion. The strong export growth led to the trade deficit contracting in October to $1.3 billion. Exports are now on track to reach a record value in the calendar year 2005, with exports for the 10 months to October having risen 13.9 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year.The economic prosperity Australians have enjoyed over the last 9½ years has been underpinned by a number of things, but particularly the export growth that has taken place in Australia, the value that those exports bring into Australia and the jobs that they sustain in the Australian economy. The Australian government has worked to encourage and support this unprecedented export success in a whole range of ways. Our economic management in Australia has provided a strong foundation for these businesses and exporters. Our preparedness to pursue reforms that improve their competitiveness and productivity has helped improve their circumstances in competing with the rest of the world.At the same time, we need to continue to work hard to open up markets across the world and remove unnecessary barriers to trade across the world. That is exactly what we are doing in our very dogged pursuit of a better set of circumstances in the multilateral system. Next week we will be taking a delegation to Hong Kong to the next ministerial meeting of the WTO - the Doha Round of global trade negotiations - where we are seeking improvements in agricultural market access, non-agricultural market access and improved circumstances for services.I met last weekend in Geneva with a small group of key players attempting to break the deadlock and push the agricultural negotiations further forward in preparation for the meeting in Hong Kong next week. The discussions have been tough but we have maintained a great deal of focus on ensuring that the major agricultural subsidisers deliver more in this round in terms of market access. That will in turn lead to greater market access for industrial goods and greater market access for services exporters. Our government's trade policy is about job creation. Supporting Australia's exporters is about job creation, and Australia's exporters have played their part in increasing the number of jobs available in the Australian economy in recent years. We will continue to work with the job creators in our economy to ensure that they are efficient and competitive and that they have the best opportunities in the markets of the world.</DOC>

 - I answer the member's question in this way: the allegations with regard to Alia surfaced as a result of the Volcker inquiry - and he is well aware of that. Concerns have been raised on a number of occasions. They were immediately referred to the organisation running the program, and that was the United Nations. There were concerns raised by commercial competitors and they were referred to the UN, and the UN continued the operation of the oil for food program. The member would also be aware that the question of Jordanian transport operations was raised earlier in the program - not Alia. Alia arose - and he is well aware of this - as a result of the Volcker inquiry. The government has announced that there will be a commission of inquiry and that is about to begin, in accordance with -  - In conclusion, the government has announced and established a commission of inquiry with significant powers as far as this issue is concerned, and that is about to begin. We should leave it to that commission of inquiry to seek out the information and the evidence in accordance with the suggestions that have been made -  - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. I can inform him that tomorrow the government will be introducing legislation to establish one of the most far-sighted vehicles to set Australia up for future opportunities that has ever been put together - the Future Fund, which is designed to fund Australia to meet the costs of the ageing of the population. When this government was elected in 1996, Commonwealth net debt was $96 billion. By 30 June in this financial year we are forecasting that, after 10 years of coalition government, we will have reduced Commonwealth net debt by $90 billion - a $90 billion payback of Labor's $96 billion of debt. This gives Australia the opportunity to now build an asset position which will be used to fund future liabilities and, in particular, unfunded superannuation liabilities. The Commonwealth's unfunded superannuation liabilities at the moment are $90 billion. They are expected to grow by 2020 to $140 billion. With the establishment of the Future Fund, an investment which the Commonwealth can now engage in, we now have the opportunity to make financial provision for future generations. It is the plan of the Australian government to fund those liabilities by 2020. We will be beginning with seed capital into the Future Fund, which will be appropriated under the bill to be introduced tomorrow, of $18 billion; $18 billion will be put into the Future Fund to put that fund together for unfunded superannuation liabilities.It is important that we lock this fund away from future governments. The first politician out of the blocks promising to raid the Future Fund for his unfunded, expensive promises was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who was recently reported in the Northern Star as saying that he intended to improve the Pacific Highway on the Northern Rivers and 'plans to commandeer Treasurer Peter Costello's Future Fund'. He is like a bear with his paws in honey - already caught raiding the honey pot. For him, the Future Fund is just money for honey. This bear that has his paws in the honey pot is already dreaming of spending money which he never had the wit to set aside and which is being used to set Australia up for future generations. This government has relieved future generations of Labor debt, and we will build opportunities for them with the Australian Future Fund.</DOC>

Just when you thought he was running out of relevance in this parliament, the sound effects man comes to the fore! As I told the House yesterday, this matter was discussed fully in the cabinet. There was full and unanimous endorsement in the cabinet. Nobody in the cabinet raised with me or with the Prime Minister, to my knowledge, or with anybody else any reservation in relation to those tax matters. As I said yesterday, the first knowledge of them came when they were reported in the AFR.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know - this is one thing I do know - that the member for Bowman is a serious member of this parliament and is making a great contribution. The inaugural East Asia Summit, in which Australia will participate as a founding member, is going to take place next week on 14 December in Kuala Lumpur, and the Prime Minister will be attending. This is an important development in the evolution of the architecture of the East Asia and Asia-Pacific region. This summit will bring together the leaders of 16 regional countries - the ASEAN countries as well as China, Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand. These countries collectively represent 49 per cent of the world's population and 21 per cent of global trade, so this is not an unimportant meeting.Later this week I will be going to Kuala Lumpur and meeting on 10 December with my foreign ministerial colleagues to make preparations for the summit. I would expect that the leaders summit will address a wide range of transnational issues of importance to the region: counter-terrorism, economic integration, energy security, governance, avian flu and so on. But this, of course, is the first summit, so it is only the very beginning of a process which will evolve over the years. At this stage we do not know how it is going to evolve, but we can say this: the East Asia summit along with the ASEAN Regional Forum, APEC, ASEAN, ASEAN plus 3 and so on will all in their own different ways make a contribution to the emergence of an East Asia community. The fact that Australia is there at the beginning of the emergence of an East Asia community, however that develops and whatever its character may be, is an important development for Australia.I think it is fair to say that the East Asia summit comes at a time when Australia's ties with East Asia have never been stronger or more diverse. We have excellent political cooperation to help deal with problems such as terrorism and transnational crime. The volume of our trade with the region continues to grow. Our exports to the East Asia Summit countries over the past six years have grown by 48 per cent. Negotiations are under way to develop an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade area, and we have free trade agreements under negotiation with Malaysia and China.Finally, and I know the Minister for Education, Science and Training appreciates this very much, it is worth noting that if you exclude students from New Zealand - we do not have accurate figures for New Zealand - there are some 205,000 students from East Asia Summit countries studying in Australia. It was once said by the Labor Party that this government would not be able to deal with Asia. I do not think any government in the history of Australian federation has so successfully dealt with Asia as this government. Much as it may pain the Leader of the Opposition, who maintains a pretence to know something about foreign and security policy, the public know that on those issues he is weak.</DOC>

We are proud of you and we support you. 
Honourable members - Hear, hear! - In relation to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, it would obviously have been the case that, as leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, I would have had discussions about Mr Walker's replacement, he having indicated in his statement today that he said in 2002 that he was going to stand down. Mr Walker also went on in that statement to say that Mr Gerard was approached and Mr Gerard declined without giving any specific reason. I can certainly repeat what I said to a spokesman last night, that I have no recollection of Mr Gerard declining on account of matters relating to tax.You asked me whether I had any discussions with the Treasurer. I have actually no specific recollection of a discussion with the Treasurer about this matter, although it is entirely possible. In the nature of things, he being the deputy leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party, we would have talked about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and for her interest in the Australian economy. That is what gives Australians their future in the labour market and it is what determines whether or not they can afford their housing, to educate their children and to pay their mortgages. I welcome her interest in the Australian economy and its prospects, which is not matched by the opposition.Today we had housing finance figures released showing that the total value of housing finance commitments rose 2.5 per cent in the month of October. This was driven by increases in the value of both owner-occupied and investor-financed housing. Despite a slight fall in October, the number of first home buyers entering the housing market remains at a high level, with around 10,200 loans to new home buyers over the month. So the number of loans to first home buyers has now been above the long-run average for eight consecutive months, and that is a good thing. We are seeing now first home buyers, many of whom will be in the electorate of Makin, returning to the market because we have seen a stabilisation of prices without increases in mortgage interest rates.My colleague the Minister for Trade has already spoken to the House about today's international trade figures and the welcome increase in exports as opposed to a more moderate increase in imports. The consequence of that is that the trade deficit for the month of October narrowed, and the good news is that last week ABARE released its September crop report which upgraded the winter crop production forecast to 37.8 million tonnes. This is 20 per cent higher than in 2004-05. So we are seeing crops being upgraded, we are seeing very strong export opportunities coming in the mining industry and, although it has taken some time, I believe investment in mining infrastructure is now starting to come on-stream in a way which will boost mineral exports.Tomorrow the national accounts will be released, which will give us the first snapshot of growth in this financial year - the September quarter of 2005. On the back of the national accounts, the government will then prepare its midyear review, which will update its forecasts, and hopefully that will be released before Christmas. That is certainly the aim. If there are no surprises in the national accounts, that will allow for an update of all of our forecasts and fiscal position.</DOC>

 - The import behind this allegation collapsed today when Mr Walker put out his statement, which the Prime Minister has already read out. Mr Walker said that when he went to Mr Gerard he declined to be considered for the post and gave no specific reason. So how Mr Walker could pass on to me a reason which was not in fact given to him is a bit beyond me. But no doubt the inventive minds of the opposition will work on that one as well. As for Mr Walker himself, yes, I believe that Mr Walker is a very fine man. Mr Walker has done a lot for this country. He is the chairman of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, appointed by a state Labor government which apparently has full confidence in him. He has managed numerous Olympic bids for Australians. If you ever wanted an accolade in life, what could be a higher one than to be the chairman of the Fairfax newspaper company, which Mr Walker also is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. As he knows, this week the Senate is debating the Welfare to Work bills which show that this government is prepared to address the challenges which face Australia. At a time when we have labour force shortages in this country, we also have around 19 per cent of the working age population in receipt of income support and a growing dependence on both the disability support pension and the parenting payment single by people who are able and, indeed, willing to work. In fact, there are now more Australians in receipt of the disability support pension than there are in receipt of the Newstart allowance, which is the unemployment benefit. The sad reality is that there are still some 700,000 children in households in Australia where nobody has a job. It is because of these issues that the government is addressing the Welfare to Work measures in order to assist people to obtain the best possible form of welfare - namely, a job - but also to provide continuing support for those who are unable to do so.This legislation is a test for the Labor Party as to where it stands in relation to welfare in Australia. I note that the Australian Labor Party still has not got a welfare to work policy. Indeed, a search of its web site and policy announcements reveals that there is absolutely nothing in relation to welfare to work from the Australian Labor Party. The closest we came was at the last election where the Labor Party called for a policy summit. I note the words written in the diary of that well-known diarist - Mr Latham, that is - on the day that this was released. He said:Is this the low point in our five wasted years? A Crean-Swan press release today announcing that our election policy on poverty is to convene a summit ...There is one document from the Australian Labor Party that even comes close to something on this subject. It is Kim Beazley's plan for disability services. Tellingly, it says this:Labor will develop a National Plan for Disability Policy. This will be a ten-year framework ...This document was released in 2001, some four years ago. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'How absurd!' Indeed, how absurd it is. Four years ago, the Australian Labor Party said it has not got a policy; it has not got any funding for this policy. Its policy is a policy to develop a policy and that policy is going to be developed over a 10-year period. Worse than that, four years into that 10-year period it still does not have a policy.The reality is that this government is getting on with making changes to address the challenges facing Australia. Part of that change is to recognise the reality of part-time employment in Australia. When the social security system was established in this country during the Second World War, there was full-time work or unemployment. Today there are many hundreds of thousands of people who are engaged in part-time work, and we believe that it is appropriate to encourage people who are capable of working part time to work part time. That of course stands in marked contrast to the attitude of the Australian Labor Party. We all recall the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on Meet the Press on 18 April last year. She was asked by Mr Bongiorno:But, Jenny Macklin, isn't it a fact that a casual job is better than no job?To which Ms Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, replied:Well, I don't think that's the case ...In other words, we have an Australian Labor Party still stuck in the 1940s so far as policy is concerned. There is no work to develop policies in this country. We have opportunism from the Australian Labor Party, but as we come towards the end of another year there could be no greater contrast between a government which is getting on and meeting the challenges of Australia and an opposition which is totally bereft of policy led by a man who is simply lazy when it comes to policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. I can confirm that Charles Sturt University, in which he might have the greatest interest, will receive an additional $73 million as a result of the government's reforms to higher education. I can also confirm that the regional universities will specifically be receiving an additional $143 million to support their regional activities. I can also confirm to the House that, of the 39 publicly funded universities, publicly available accounts can only be obtained in 13 of those cases, and in four of those cases those accounts are incomplete. Of the nine student accounts that we are able to get hold of because they are in the public arena - student unions are currently treated by universities as independent business units within the universities - I can tell you that the total union revenue of Charles Sturt University is $1.9 million and, of that, $950,000 is compulsorily acquired.My department also tells me that there are 3,000 students who attend the university but that there are 4½ thousand students at Charles Sturt University who do not ever set foot on the campus. Each of them is required to pay $136 a year. They do not ever attend the university, yet they are required to subsidise a whole variety of services they neither need nor want and certainly do not use. My department advises me - and it is certainly the government's view - that it is long past time that students in Australia, whether they live in cities or whether they live in rural and regional communities, should be free to decide what services they will purchase when they go to university and which organisations, student unions, guilds or associations they will join. That is the government's position. The government is determined to make sure that Australian students, particularly students from struggling regional communities, have choice in relation to going to university.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and his interest in this serious issue. The trial that is under way at the moment of Saddam Hussein, the former dictator of Iraq, is the first of what is likely to be a number of trials in relation to him and his henchmen. In this case, it is a trial relating to a massacre of 148 people in the village of Dujail in 1982. Overnight, the first of the witnesses, Ahmed Hassan Mohammed, appeared in person. He gave his testimony, which of course will be tested by the court. In his testimony, he said that hundreds of men, women and children, including his own family, were taken to intelligence headquarters in Baghdad. In an emotional testimony, he described scenes of torture. I will not repeat the details here, but he witnessed the torture of his own family and friends. He said: 'A friend of mine was tortured. He was actually killed in front of me. I saw that. People who were arrested were taken to prison and most of them were killed there.' The second witness who appeared, Jawaad Abd-al-Aziz Jawaad, testified that Saddam's presidential guard had bombed the village repeatedly.This trial is being conducted by Iraqis. Australia, along with other countries, is helping to provide training for the judges, prosecutors and court officials, but this is an Iraqi trial and it is an important step for the new Iraq and for the Iraqi people. What this trial does do is demonstrate to all Iraqis that they no longer need fear their former dictator. It demonstrates to tyrants everywhere around the world that they should be prepared for a day of justice that could very well be served on them. It also demonstrates how right this government has been to take up the challenge and contribute to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's brutal tyranny and his dictatorship.We on this side of the House do not forget that, in all his years in office, it is at least alleged that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the deaths of anything up to two million people, if you are to include the impact of the Iran-Iraq war, which he started. We on this side of the House will not forget that, if the Labor Party had had its way and if its policy had ever been implemented, Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Iraq.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question from the member for Solomon. I know how seriously he takes this issue. Let me say that Aboriginal health is one of the most intractable problems that Australia faces, but it is not all bad news. I can inform the House that the latest statistics show that Indigenous mortality in Western Australia fell by 25 per cent between 1991 and 2002. For its part, the Howard government has certainly built on the efforts of its predecessors. Indigenous-specific health spending has increased from about $100 million in 1996 to some $350 million in the current financial year. We have tried not just to spend the money; we have tried to remember Noel Pearson's admonition that Aboriginal people have the right to take responsibility for their own communities and their own advancement.I can today inform the House of a range of further initiatives: some 27 Aboriginal health services will receive up to $400,000 a year for four years to promote infant and maternal health; four Aboriginal health services will receive an extra $30 million over four years to address critical health issues, most notably in Cape York and at Wadeye, in the Northern Territory; seven additional communities will have access to unsniffable petrol; and some $900,000 will be spent on trachoma surveillance and screening programs to try to avoid preventable blindness amongst Aboriginals living in the Central Desert.It is almost the test of our seriousness as a nation that we do not take failure for granted in an area such as this. You can certainly trust the Howard government to consider new initiatives to try to ensure that Aboriginal communities are helped, particularly when they are prepared to help themselves. This is a government that is determined to help the vulnerable people of our country. What do we see from members opposite? Nothing but scandalmongering. I turned to Labor's forbidden book and I saw: 'People think Beazley is a big angel' - </DOC>

In fact, if you had listened to the answer I gave, I said I had not directed him - in the answer, after that was alleged by the member for Lilley. -  - I know that you have to string out another three questions to get to the end of question time.

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question, because I know that as a member from Western Sydney she is very interested in these issues, which impact as much in her electorate as elsewhere in Australia. Of course, she is very much aware that the government is undertaking the most significant reforms to the family law system in over 30 years. Fundamental to those reforms is the right of children to grow up in an environment free of violence. -  - I am concerned about false allegations of violence and abuse, as I am equally concerned about those who make false denials. But I want to make it very clear that this government does not tolerate violence against any person. We need to take a practical and informed approach in dealing with these issues. Last week I announced that the government will commission, as part of a broader family law violence strategy, independent research about how the courts are currently dealing with allegations of violence. I am working with the states to improve the ways in which their agencies investigate these matters. I noticed that some members opposite were interjecting. I would like to invoke their assistance in reminding their state colleagues of the need for state and territory governments, in particular, to fulfil their responsibilities. I might say that not all of them are doing that well. Instead of making ill-founded comments, which I have seen from time to time, that our reforms will expose more children and women to violence -  - I would hope, as one commentator wrote last week of the member for Sydney, who was interjecting, that they would change their view and not be so intent on shoring up 'her feminist constituency'. I have to say in relation to this matter that I do not think members of the Labor Party get it. This is not a battle along ideological lines and it is not about the rights of men or women; it is about ensuring that children grow up in a safe environment, with the best opportunity of having the love and support of their mum and dad.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Her obvious interest in this issue is both as a member of this place and as an employer in her own right, and due to her interest in the welfare of women, particularly in the Shoalhaven and Nowra region. She is only too well aware that as the labour market has evolved over the years there are more and more women in the labour market. In fact, in Australia today we have historically high levels of female participation in the work force. That is a very positive thing. We are all aware that women move out of the work force more regularly than men, quite often to have a family. Under former policy - the rigid superannuation policy of the Labor Party - when that occurred these women were denied the opportunity to continue to contribute to their own superannuation and make savings for their own retirement. It was a foolhardy policy if I have ever seen one. The coalition moved to change that and remove the work test so that the sorts of women that the member for Gilmore is very interested in assisting - who may have taken up the government's co-contribution and received $1.50 for every dollar contribution - could continue to contribute to their own superannuation at times when they are out of the labour market. Unfortunately it is not Labor Party policy.There was an interesting contribution in the Sunday Age on 4 December this year by David Potts. He wrote in reference to a number of the positive initiatives of the Howard government in the area of superannuation. He said:So any adult can contribute to super. Yes, it beggars belief that this wasn't always the case, but there you go.It does beggar belief today, here in December 2005, that the Labor Party is still wedded to a policy of the past - a policy which denies women the right to contribute to their own superannuation when they are having a family. This is a party that has put itself forward as a party for women. It has clearly denied them a fundamental right when they are in the work force and when they are in retirement.The Labor Party will get an opportunity to lighten up a little bit and get out of the dinosaur age this week, when the superannuation-splitting bill comes before the Senate. It will have the opportunity to support the government. From 1 January superannuation companies will be able to offer contribution splitting to families. When one spouse is out of the work force families will be able to split their superannuation contributions, giving them greater access to the tax effectiveness of the superannuation benefits tax relief that the government provides. This is another positive initiative for the women of Australia that the Howard government has put into place. It will back up the super co-contribution, the removal of the work test and the removal of the super surcharge. All in all, it is a policy for the future - unlike those of the dinosaurs that sit opposite, who are lazy in policy and reflect on industrial relations from another era and workplace relations and superannuation policies that have no place in a modern Australian economy.</DOC>

The suggestion that either I knew or my office knew or had gone through court records in 2003 is absolutely repudiated. The idea that I knew anything that was in the AFR is absolutely repudiated. The idea that my chief of staff knew those matters is absolutely repudiated. The idea that there was any conspiracy is absolutely repudiated. - Yesterday they were saying that Mr Walker had passed this information on to me. What transpires today - Mr Walker did not even know this -  - let alone was he in a position to pass this on. Here we have an opposition which has made false allegation after false allegation. If this was all known in March 2003, why didn't somebody in the press gallery report it? If this was all so well known in March 2003, why didn't the opposition report it? The Leader of the Opposition was asked earlier today - I believe - on 3AW: 'Why didn't you raise this in March 2003?' And he said, 'Oh, well, the Iraq war was on.' We are going back to March 2003. Did anybody raise anything against Mr Gerard in March 2003? No. In June 2003? No. In September 2003? No. In December 2003? No. In March 2004? No. - In June 2004? I could go on. It was so well known that for three years -  - nobody raised a single thing, because nobody had any more knowledge in relation to these matters than the government had. I defy the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition who now say, 'Ron Walker knew and the Adelaide Advertiser knew and people were down there looking through court records'. All they have got to do is produce one statement of their own which shows how well these matters were known. The question that was put by the Leader of the Opposition, which he put so that he could move his censure motion - which we now eagerly anticipate - was absolutely false. It is absolutely repudiated and it does not have a skerrick of evidence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan. I can inform him that national accounts were released today which indicate the state of the economy in the September quarter of 2005. Those national accounts showed that the economy grew by a modest 0.2 per cent for the quarter, and 2.6 per cent through the year. This comes after the strong growth we saw in the June quarter. Consumption has moderated, undoubtedly due to higher petrol prices. It appears that, with the house market turning down in value, consumers or home buyers have taken the opportunity to consolidate their balance sheets. The dwelling sector continues to experience a relatively mild downturn.Australia is in the midst of a very strong investment boom. Total new business investment rose another 2.5 per cent in the September quarter and is now 17.6 per cent higher through the year. This is supported by terms of trade which are as high as we have seen since 1974. It is also supported by the fact that business profits are higher as a percentage of total factor income than ever previously recorded in Australian history.Notwithstanding the rise in the terms of trade, inflation remains moderate. What that means is that the economy is now shifting from consumption to investment, we are lifting our capacity and we are now getting good strong infrastructure investment, which gives the opportunity to lift the capacity of the Australian economy and meet the boom in mineral commodities which is coming, led principally by China and to some degree India. That means we are building for the longer term. These infrastructure developments take time to be brought in but, as that capacity comes on line, I would expect Australia's exports to increase.For the member for McMillan and others who are interested in economic prospects in this country, this means that the Australian economy continues to grow in a sustainable way, with unemployment as low as it has been for 30 years and inflation which is moderate and under control. It is important that we keep economic reform going in this country to lift productivity. Nothing could be more important than the industrial relations changes that have just been passed because they will give Australia the opportunities of the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and for his continued interest in business and the opportunities for Australians in employment. I can inform him about a couple of recent surveys. Firstly, the Sensis business index for small and medium enterprises recently found that 15 per cent of small and medium businesses in Australia expect to increase the size of their work force in the next 12 months. If those businesses were to employ just one more person each, that would amount to over 150,000 new jobs in Australia.The outlook for employees is also good. Today the latest version of a regular Morgan poll on employee attitudes was released. This is an important longitudinal survey which has been conducted now for 30 years, since 1975, so it gives us a sense of the way in which employee attitudes have changed over that 30-year period. What today's release shows is that 83 per cent of Australian employees feel secure in their jobs, and that figure has risen by four per cent since December 2004 - a very interesting figure. This is at a time when we have had the opposition running a scare campaign around Australia saying that, as a result of changes to workplace relations, the divorce rate will go up, the incidence of disease in Australia will go up and men, women and children will be killed on picket lines in Australia. Despite this hysterical campaign from the union movement and the Labor Party, this 30-year longitudinal study shows that the attitude towards job security of Australian workers is the highest that has ever been recorded.What is also interesting about this is that, when I looked into the 30 years of this longitudinal survey, I found that the highest level of job insecurity occurred in November 1992. And who was on the watch so far as employment policy in Australia was concerned in November 1992? None other than the member for Brand, the current Leader of the Opposition. No wonder there were high levels of job insecurity in 1992, because of course this was a time when the unemployment rate in Australia was 10.9 per cent. There were one million Australians who were unemployed as a result of the policies of the Australian Labor Party and the cabinet of which the Leader of the Opposition was then a member.What we see today is interesting because what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do for Australia is to roll us back to those policies which pertained in Australia in 1992, a time when the highest level of job insecurity was felt by Australian employees and a time when one million people were unemployed. That is the reality of what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do. That is what his roll-back is all about. On this side of politics, we will meet the challenges of the future in Australia. We will not go looking to the past like the Leader of the Opposition is doing.</DOC>

 - Mr Gerard was treated in exactly the same way as other appointees. If this is a question about a story that I read in the paper today, which said that somebody had previously had an ASIO or security check, I have inquired of the department about that. The department have no record of any such check being made in relation to Mr Pagan. In fact, the department tell me that they have never done it.Again, on a new day, there is another allegation, another falsity. The only thing that puzzles me about all of this is whether the Labor Party can get through another seven questions without mentioning interest rates, the economy, jobs, the national accounts or the trade position. I recall the Labor Party saying that it was going to try to build economic credibility after it lost its third election. - It remains to be seen whether the Labor Party can build any economic credibility. It has not asked a question on the economy over the last two weeks, and it stands for nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. I can inform him and the House that cancer remains one of Australia's biggest killers, accounting for some 25 per cent of all deaths. One in three men and one in four women will have personal experience of cancer before the age of 75. But there is some good news: cancer death rates have been falling by about two per cent a year over the last decade. But the Howard government is certainly not going to rest on its laurels.This year's budget provided an additional $189 million for cancer initiatives, including $43 million to phase in a national bowel cancer screening program, $23 million for local palliative care grants, $22 million for clinical trial infrastructure and $17 million for dedicated cancer research. I can inform the House that the government has just announced the establishment of Cancer Australia, a new leadership body to coordinate and advise on cancer treatment, cancer research and cancer education. The chairman of the Cancer Australia advisory council will be Dr Bill Glasson, the former president of the AMA. I can also inform the House that the establishment of Cancer Australia has been widely welcomed, which is another sign that most Australians think our health system is in good hands under the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question and for his very strong support of the car industry, particularly in his electorate of Kingston, and for the investment that, with this government, he has worked to ensure continues to go into that area. When it comes to building a sustainable future for the car industry, this government's commitment is as strong as ever. We already back the sector to the tune of over $7 billion, which ensures that we create stimulation in the innovation and investment area of the car industry. Boosted by a strong economy and a government that is prepared to have the courage to put in place reforms that keep industry viable and give it confidence in the future, the car industry is rising to the challenges that it currently faces.In 2002-03, the car sector invested more than $630 million in automotive R&amp;D - an increase of some $140 million on the previous year. This year in March, we saw Toyota announce a new R&amp;D centre in Victoria and, only yesterday, we saw Holden announce that it would expand its Port Melbourne facilities to become the global hub of automotive design and engineering. GMH's design director, Tony Stolfo, said:It's just amazing to think about what that says about this country's - Australia's - creativity. From today, it says we can create cars for just about anyone, anywhere.I could not have said that better myself. Through innovation and investment, the Australian car industry is giving itself every chance for a strong and competitive future.By contrast, the Labor Party is working on a different agenda. At the last election, the Labor Party confirmed its commitment to abolishing Invest Australia - the very body that attracts investment to Australia in a whole range of areas, including the car industry. It has also committed to cutting $100 million from the automotive R&amp;D scheme - the same scheme that has seen this government contribute some $42 million to cutting-edge Australian car industry research. The Labor Party's anti-investment and antibusiness record speaks for itself. The Labor Party cannot be trusted with the future of Australian industry.</DOC>

 - That is a ridiculous question. The idea that the Treasurer of the day decides who gets prosecuted under the Income Tax Act, the idea that the Treasurer of the day is responsible for who gets prosecuted or the idea that the Treasurer of the day is responsible for enforcing guidelines is a complete nonsense. The Commissioner of Taxation is an independent statutory officer. He is an independent statutory officer for a very good reason: so that no politician would have the opportunity to influence the Commissioner of Taxation in prosecutions or in relation to the guidelines. This has always been the case and it always will be the case. If the honourable member wants to ask the commissioner, he should direct his question to the commissioner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I can inform the member for Stirling and indeed the House that the government is intending to do this with a very simple proposition - that is, every one of the 700,000 Australians who go to university will be free to choose whether or not they will join a student union, guild or association.I am asked about alternative policies. On Monday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave a doorstop interview. It is a very interesting transcript. She was asked a question about who, under Labor's plan, would actually collect the compulsory Labor fees that would continue under Labor's plan. She said: 'The universities - well, I'll double check. It's such a long time since we drafted it, actually.' In other words, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not even know what is in her own amendment. But she went on to say: 'It's exactly what happens in Victoria now.' So the Labor Party plan, as it is, is how student unionism currently operates in the state of Victoria.So what happens in the state of Victoria? To give you some insight, the Australian newspaper on 25 October this year reported this:Monash University Students' Association president Nick Richardson said yesterday there was no barrier under the Victorian VSU model to spending student fees on political campaigns.'For us, it's totally meaningless,' he said.'The formula that was brought in depended on universities to implement it. In our situation, funding sources, other than the amenities fees, can be used for political activities. At the moment it's only a budgetary thing to get around VSU.The average Australian probably thinks, 'Well, these are students who are having to part with their hard-earned money, many of them mature aged students getting an education.' In terms of what that money is currently used for in the state of Victoria under the Labor Party's plan, for example, it is reported in the Herald Sun of 23 November this year:Money from Victorian students has been used by the Monash University student union to pay an Iraqi oil worker with links to anti-coalition forces.Minutes from a Monash Student Association meeting in May show the union gave $1000 to Foraok Isma'al as part of an Australian speaking tour for the union activist.Let us make it absolutely clear. Under Labor's plans, under the existing model in the state of Victoria, for those who support so-called amenities fees, we have student union fees, forcibly appropriated from students who have no interest in this at all, funding a speaking tour by a southern Iraqi oil worker. If you want to know what this organisation is about, go to the Guardian newspaper on 18 February this year. In an article from Hassan Juma'a Awad, who is the general secretary of this oil company union, he said this:The resistance to the occupation forces is a God-given right of Iraqis, and we, as a union, see ourselves as a necessary part of this resistance ...It is enough that there are some Australians who think that they should seek to undermine the integrity and sovereignty of our country, but that the Labor Party should seek to -  -  - Today in Iraq are Australian service men and women who are putting their lives on the line in the name of Australia to build a free Iraq, and the Labor Party - </DOC>

 - The honourable member says that something illegal happened in 1994, so I would have expected that the Treasurer in 1994 would have referred it for investigation. But I do think it is a bit hard on poor old Ralph Willis to make that allegation now, because Ralph Willis was the Treasurer in 1994. Why wasn't Ralph Willis down directing prosecutions at the tax office? I will tell you why Ralph Willis was not down directing tax -  -  - Oh, and the Minister for Finance in 1994 was the current Leader of the Opposition. And why wasn't the finance minister down directing prosecutions at the tax office in 1994? I will tell you why. He was too busy running around saying the budget was in surplus when it was $10 billion in deficit. That is why. That is how accurate he was. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and note his very deep interest in the wellbeing of Indigenous people in his electorate. The Howard government is committed to ensuring that older Indigenous Australians have access to appropriate aged care services. There are currently around 60 specifically funded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care homes. In addition to recurrent subsidies, the Australian government is now investing a further $10.3 million over four years by way of a viability supplement, recognising the particular difficulties of providing aged care in rural and remote areas.I have visited a number of these homes. Recently, I visited some in Derby in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. I have also visited some in the electorates of Solomon and Leichhardt. I have been very impressed with the quality of care and the standards that are being achieved in these Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care homes. At the recent Ministerial Awards for Excellence in Aged Care, of the 10 national awards, two Indigenous workers were recognised for their contributions to culturally appropriate aged care.Last week, the Minister for Human Services and I announced a new program to assist older Indigenous Australians. Specifically, it is a free hearing assessment service and, if necessary, free hearing aids for older Indigenous Australians. We understand that about 20 per cent of older Indigenous Australians have reported hearing loss. We expect that the figure is in fact higher than that. This $10 million program will provide free hearing assessment services and remedial action, if necessary, throughout Australia in rural and remote communities, including through mobile service units. This is another example of the Australian government developing policies and providing funding for practical assistance to older Indigenous Australians.</DOC>

In relation to this matter, as I said earlier, when he contacted the ATO he was told that confidentiality provisions prevented any information being given to him.I repeat again that he was not told about any of the matters which were in the Australian Financial Review - nor was I told about those matters, nor do I believe that any member of the opposition knew about them until they were published in the AFR, nor do I believe that any other media outlet knew about them, nor any television or radio outlet.

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his interest in Australian families and their welfare as we lead into Christmas 2005. It was great news today that the RBA has ensured that variable home loan interest rates will not be going up. We are not going to see Australian families struggling away trying to find a few extra dollars for the bank, which could have gone for kiddies' presents or perhaps a bit of Christmas fare.I remind the House that in 1995, as we headed into Christmas under a Labor government, those same families were slugged with a 10½ per cent interest rate on their mortgage - money which was going straight to the banks, not to the families.Moreover, these same families now have the benefit of 'fool's gold'. 'Fool's gold' is what it is known as by the member for Lilley; it is otherwise known as family tax benefit part A supplement. Take the average family in the electorate of Hasluck, with a couple of kids. If they put their tax in on time on 30 October, they could have received a supplement of $1,255.60. That is real money for real Australian working families to put towards the Christmas that they deserve - to have a holiday, to put a bit of Christmas fare on the table, to buy a gift for the kids. - What does the member for Lilley think? The member for Lilley says, 'It's not real.' The only thing that is not real is the attitude of the member for Lilley. I would like him to go to the families in Nundah or Margate in his electorate and say to them, 'Oh, listen, that money you got the other day from tax - it's not real. Don't go and buy the kids a bike with that because it's not real; it will evaporate.' It will not evaporate under a coalition government, I can tell the member for Lilley. The member for Hasluck can tell his families that it will continue to expand every year under a Howard government. Because of the tax policies and the superannuation policies of the Howard government, the good news as we head into Christmas is that families in Hasluck and around Australia can feel more secure.As those families headed into 1995, they did have something to look forward to. We will come to that in a moment. What they had to look forward to was 7.3 per cent unemployment in the electorate of Hasluck. Today that is at 4.3 per cent. There are more Australians with jobs, doing something positive for themselves.What if that hardworking family in the electorate of Hasluck, say in Forrestfield, wants to do a little bit of extra work? What if the husband or the wife says, 'We're going to put a bit of extra time in here. We're going to add a few extra quid to put something special on for the kids.' In every hundred dollars extra they earned in overtime, that average family would have been paying $12 to $18 - money lost straight to the tax system. Today that money is in their pocket. They can decide what to do with it. They may even decide to put that money into the future. They may decide to put a bit of that money into superannuation. And do you know what, Mr Speaker? They will not only pay less tax; the Howard government will give them $1.50 for every dollar they put into their own superannuation so that they can build a benefit for today and into the future.That is what good policy is about. Those families can look forward to a child-care rebate into the future as well, as a result of the policies of the Howard government delivering real assistance for Australian families through positive taxation and positive superannuation, not the failed, lazy, dinosaur based policies presented by those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question. I think, with respect, through you, Mr Speaker, I would say this to the member for New England: he has really raised two separate issues. The principles that I talked about when I made the announcement with the former New South Wales Premier canvassed the entitlement to compensation in circumstances where, say, some kind of natural event led to a loss of the water entitlement and also where, by contrast, a decision of government resulted in the water entitlement being cut back. I would have to check the text, but my recollection is that we laid down that in certain circumstances there could not be compensation and in other circumstances compensation would have to be shared or the cost would have to be shared between the government - the Crown - and the water holder.As I understand the honourable member's question, it relates to a taxation ruling. Of course, that is a horse of a different colour. I will nonetheless look at what the honourable member has put to me. But, on the face of it, with a superficial understanding of what the honourable member is putting to me, I would not have thought that that quite fell into the category that I had in mind when I made that statement with Mr Carr.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. It is a great thing, being the minister for Work for the Dole, to hear about some of the tremendous projects that are operated around the country. On many occasions, members on this side of the House relate stories to me about how successful Work for the Dole projects have been in their own electorates. They talk about how they have helped young people into jobs. They talk about how they have delivered the opportunity for people to hand back to their community during their time of need.But very rarely do I hear from members of the Australian Labor Party about Work for the Dole. It is not because we do not have programs for Work for the Dole in Labor electorates; we have many. It is not because those programs are not very successful. It is because the Labor Party hate Work for the Dole. It is hard to understand why when the benefits flow so considerably to the members who are participating in the Work for the Dole programs.I decided to do a little bit of digging. I decided to look at some of the programs in the electorates of members of the Australian Labor Party. I looked at the electorate of the member for Batman, a fine member who always represents the interests of the members within his constituency, at the expense of those of the union movement. The member for Batman has always focused on his electorate. I looked at the IT and office programs, which gave job seekers IT skills, hands-on experience with computer programs like Microsoft Office and Access as well as general administration skills. Then I thought: what would the member for Batman have to say about Work for the Dole? He describes the program as evil. He was reported as saying that the Work for the Dole program is evil. But he is not the only member in the Australian Labor Party that we know despises and hates Work for the Dole.I decided to look at the electorate of Brand. What did we find in the electorate of Brand? We know that there was a very successful program in the electorate of Brand called the children's forest rehab project. Did we see the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, out there praising Work for the Dole and the wonderful opportunities that that had provided to people on Newstart in his electorate? No. The member for Brand decided to come out and talk about Work for the Dole as a failure: 'It's a piffling little program.' No doubt there was another half an hour speech associated with it; nonetheless he still talked down Work for the Dole, and he talks it down at every opportunity.After the 25 years that the member for Brand has been in this place, people in the Australian electorate ask: what does the member for Brand stand for? We know that he says one thing to the boardrooms and a different thing to the lunch rooms. We know at the end of the day that he might say in his electorate that he favours Work for the Dole, but he tells his union cronies that he hates Work for the Dole. He should get behind Work for the Dole and support a great program.</DOC>

 - In answer to the last part of the member's question, the answer is no. The member continually raises this assertion and allegation with regard to the government. Suggestions that the Australian government would have knowingly allowed kickbacks are unfunded and untrue - unfounded. Mr Speaker, the member for Griffith raised -  - Assertions that are being made by the member for Griffith are completely unfounded and untrue. That is exactly what the Volcker inquiry found. The member for Griffith referred to concerns raised in 2000 and 2003 in his question, when general concerns were raised about contracts. I am advised that on both occasions the matters were referred to the United Nations, who were running the Oil for Food Program. As far as I am aware these concerns were dealt with to the UN's satisfaction with respect to their program. Following that the Volcker inquiry went through this issue forensically. The government and my department cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, and the Volcker inquiry has found no wrongdoing on behalf of our government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his passionate support of small business. I can tell the House that this government is about building for the future. Last week I launched the government's program Building Entrepreneurship in Small Business, a program designed specifically to develop skills in our young entrepreneurs and to encourage young people to consider starting up their own small businesses. The program is centred on building on business skills, mentoring and succession planning.Less than 10 per cent of Australia's 1.2 million small business operators are under the age of 30. So this government is putting in measures which really are building for the future and providing assistance to these young people. I can inform the House that, in just the week since this program has been launched, the AusIndustry hotline and web site has been taking record hits.I am asked if there are any alternatives. I have to inform the House that the opposition has delivered zero for small business, absolutely zero. There has been no policy development. There has been no initiative whatsoever for small business. In fact, I think the Leader of the Opposition has been following the words and the lead of Greg Combet, when on 12 October ABC listeners -  - Small business are actually very interested, Leader of the Opposition. As I said, the Leader of the Opposition is following Greg Combet's lead, when he said he is afraid that he is no advocate for small business and neither is this opposition. Small businesses around the country know that it is only this government that is building now for the future for small business.</DOC>

 - What I can confirm to the member for Griffith is that each time this issue was raised the government acted with proper propriety and referred the information and the issues to the people who were running the program, which was the United Nations under the particular section of the committee of the United Nations. Since then all aspects of this matter have been investigated by the United Nations, which has found no wrongdoing by the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair, who is a founding member of the Friends of Vocational and Technical Education, founded by the member for Hasluck. - There are plenty of friends of vocational and technical education on this side. I know there are not too many on that side. I also acknowledge that Group Training Australia have their members advocacy day today and a number of their delegates are here today. These are people who should take a bow and who are making an enormous difference in assisting local communities create new job opportunities for more apprentices around Australia. -  - I am listening to the cacophony of corny catchcries from those opposite. I note that they are hiding their own guilt. In 1993, when the member for Brand was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, we had an all-time low of apprentices in training of 122,600. Today we have 391,200 new apprentices in training. That is a record of definite activity in just the last 12 months.The member for Blair wants to know about how things are going. In the last 12 months we have seen new apprenticeships commencements increase by four per cent. We have seen a six per cent increase in completions in apprenticeships. We have seen an 11 per cent increase in commencements of new apprenticeships by mature aged workers. We have seen commencements in trades and related worker categories increase by seven per cent. So we have more people starting apprenticeships, more people completing apprenticeships and more people in training.Commencements in school based new apprenticeships increased by 50 per cent in the 12 months ending 30 June this year. That is despite the lack of interest from a big state like New South Wales in this program. Eighty-one per cent of all new apprentices commencing in the Australian Qualifications Framework were at level III or higher. That represents an increase of eight per cent from previous years. These recent figures are also backed by other recently released student outcome surveys from the National Council for Vocational Education Research, which reveal that 89 per cent of all graduates are either employed or in further study after their training.It is not just the fact that this government is now providing record levels of expenditure of some $10.1 billion over the next four years and that there is $1.4 billion in new initiatives provide for skills needs, the biggest ever commitment to vocational and technical education by any government - it is the fact that Australian businesses recognise that the process of apprenticeships starts because they, as the Treasurer said earlier today in question time, want to invest in their part of our economy. It is not just the investment in plant and equipment; it is not just the investment in new opportunities and new product ranges - it is very much the investment they make in their people. The government's programs will back that investment with our own effort.</DOC>

 - My answer is twofold. Firstly, the question is based on a false premise. - The false premise is that our workplace relations legislation will have the effects described by the member for Perth. But the second part of my answer is that, as I said this morning - and this question gives me the opportunity to repeat it - what we are doing is governing well for the future of this country. That is what the Australian people asked us to do in October last year and it is no accident. I know those opposite do not like what happened in October, but it was the verdict of the Australian people -  - to entrust the coalition with the management of the nation's affairs over the following three years. - We have fulfilled the responsibility and the trust we were given last October and we will go on governing for the benefit of all of the people of Australia over the remaining two years of our term in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I particularly acknowledge that he is the hero of the Tasmanian vegetable growing industry. 
A government member - He is also the hero of the forestry industry. - He is also the hero of the forestry industry, the hero of the frontbench of the government and the hero of the backbench of the Labor Party. I would not want to bet on this, but I would be pretty sure that there will not be any questions today from the Australian Labor Party about jobs, interest rates or the economy. The people of Australia are interested in jobs, interest rates and the economy and they want to know whether they can plan for the future.Today the labour force figures for November came out, showing that the unemployment rate fell from 5.2 per cent to 5.1 per cent, back around 30-year lows. The unemployment rate has been below six per cent now for 27 consecutive months, the longest period since the ABS started monthly collections. The labour force figures for November show that employment rose by 28,000 people. Although there was a fall of 20,000 part-time jobs, there was growth of 48,000 full-time jobs in the month of November. That means that, over the past year, 230,000 new jobs have been created in Australia and 57 per cent of those are full time.The tally of new jobs created since the government came to office is now 1.7 million. It is not right to say that a government creates jobs; the private sector creates jobs. But a government can so set the parameters of the economy with low interest rates, a productive economy and consumer confidence that the private sector has the ability to invest and create new jobs. Prospects for job creation continuing in the future are strong.It may well be that at around 5.1, 5.2 or five per cent we have reached a cyclical low in unemployment in Australia. If we want to take unemployment lower in Australia, we need structural change, and no structural change is more important than industrial relations reform. Industrial relations reform will make our economy more productive, give more people the chance to enter the work force, and take Australia's unemployment rate lower in structural terms. These are the reforms which are important for Australia. These are the reforms of a coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question, given that we are on the eve of the next full ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation and moving towards the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations, where we certainly hope and expect to see significant improvements in market access for all products, but particularly for agricultural products. I know the member for Riverina is very keen to see improvements for some of the products from her electorate, particularly dairy products, beef, rice, wine and some of those other great products that come out of the electorate of Riverina in the south-western part of New South Wales.Of course, the Australian government has been very focused on achieving a very ambitious outcome out of this round since it was launched in 2001 in Doha. By and large, I suspect we enjoy bipartisan support for the view that multilateral trade liberalisation is going to be to the overwhelming benefit of our nation. Whether they be exporters of industrial manufactured goods, exporters of agricultural products or exporters of services, we are looking for improved market access opportunities for all the participants in our economy.The member also asked what this could do for the developing world. That is a very important part of the question. The World Bank estimates that if we get a truly liberalising outcome from this round of trade negotiations, if the markets of the world - particularly the wealthy markets of the world - are properly opened to the developing economies of the world, that has the prospect of lifting 140 million people out of poverty. So it is the responsibility of the developed world, of countries like Australia, to give more access to the developing world.We are actually leading the way as a nation in doing that. We have already given duty-free and quota-free access into our market to all the least developed economies in the world, and in this round we are asking other developed economies to do exactly the same.So we go to Hong Kong next week with a very strong argument, leading the Cairns Group of agricultural producing countries, seeking significant improvements in market access for our agricultural exports, seeking the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture, seeking significant reductions in domestic support of agriculture, seeking significant improvements in market openings for industrial goods and services and, of course, seeking significant improvements in access for the developing countries of the world into the developed economies of the world so that they can lift their population - those 140 million people - out of poverty.We look forward during the course of next week to seeing a significant achievement in this regard, as Hong Kong should at least build a beachhead to launch into the concluding stages of this round in 2006. We challenge our colleagues - the 149 members of the WTO - to join with Australia in our very ambitious attitude towards this round for the benefit of Australian exporters, particularly Australian farmers, and the poverty stricken nations of the world.</DOC>

 - As I have told the House, the chief of staff was doing his job in relation to these matters. Nothing was passed back to him, because of confidentiality proceedings. In relation to these matters, which I think we have now gone over for three or four days, no material was known by the government that was published by the Australian Financial Review, nor was it known by the opposition, nor was it known by the cabinet, nor was it known by the ministers. This appointment was made three years ago. I point out that, in the last three years, the RBA board has performed very well in the discharge of its duty in relation to monetary policy. I am unaware of any complaint whatsoever in relation to the conduct of the RBA board over the last three years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question and for his interest in the new workplace relations system. In answer to his question, yesterday the Business Council of Australia wrote to its members, which employ over one million Australians, and urged them to utilise the new Work Choices system to achieve higher productivity and higher employment in Australia and to build mutually beneficial partnerships between employers and employees in this country. This is interesting, because this is the big business that the Australian Labor Party and the union movement have said is out to exploit workers in Australia. If we want to build higher productivity in this country, we have to build mutually beneficial partnerships between employers and employees of Australia.The Business Council pointed out to its members that research it had done a couple of years ago indicated that, had this government not engaged in workplace relations reform, the unemployment rate in Australia today - on a day that the unemployment figure for last month has been announced as being 5.1 per cent - would be closer to eight per cent; that is, that 315,000 jobs in this country today would not exist but for that reform. So we have a clear contrast: on the one hand, the Business Council of Australia is urging higher productivity through mutually beneficial partnerships between the employers and the employees; and, on the other, there is the hysterical campaign which has been run by the labour movement and the Labor Party over the last few months. Let me remind the House once again of some of the ludicrous claims that have been made by the opposition and by the labour movement. - The Leader of the Opposition is interjecting again. He is the one who said that there would be no more barbecues on weekends in Australia and that there will be more divorce in this country because of changes to workplace relations. These are the claims of the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said that the fertility rate in Australia will go down because of changes in workplace relations and that life expectancy will decline. Indeed, Unions New South Wales said that changes to industrial relations could kill people. Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, said that children would be estranged from their parents. The Leader of the Opposition said that families would be set against families and that friends would be set against friends.On top of that, Sharan Burrow said - as we approach the Christmas season - that children will not see their parents at Christmas. Today I came across the latest piece of propaganda from the union movement: the Electrical Trades Union, in New South Wales, said that children's Christmas stockings will go empty this Christmas because of changes to workplace relations. These are the ridiculous, overblown claims that are being made by the Leader of the Opposition, the Labor Party and the union movement. On this side of politics, we will get on with addressing the issues and the challenges facing Australia into the future so that we can do something to further bring down unemployment. On the other side, we are faced with an opposition that has no ideas, no policy and no leadership.</DOC>

 - I did say on radio this morning that this whole thing had lost its perspective. The point I was making then, and I will make it again very freely, is that it is in the nature of commercial life that from time to time companies, as do individuals, have disputes with the Taxation Office. The idea that there is something new, something sinister or something corrupt in a company having a dispute with the tax office simply betrays the total misunderstanding of the Australian Labor Party of normal commercial matters. Insofar as those particular transactions are concerned, the Leader of the Opposition referred to particular press statements and particular actions of the tax office. As the Leader of the Opposition surely should remember from his years in government, I think it is section 16 of the income tax act which contains the secrecy provisions. I do not recall in the 13 years that the Labor Party was in office it doing anything to alter those secrecy provisions. If the Leader of the Opposition has a problem with the administration of the act by the Commissioner of Taxation, he ought to take it up with Mr Carmody.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I thank him for showing interest in the ageing of the population and what needs to be done to protect the Australian public against the costs and the pressures that that will bring. I will make this point again: the Labor Party will not show any interest in Australians' jobs, they will not show any interest in Australians' interest rates and they will not show any interest in the state of the national economy, because these are the things that govern Australians' lives.The last time the Labor Party were in office, we did not talk about how to invest a surplus budget. What we talked about under the then finance minister was how to fund a $10 billion deficit and how to service $96 billion worth of debt. After 10 years of coalition government, we are now in a position to recover from the damage that the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, did to this country. It is forecast, by the end of this financial year, that we will have reduced the $96 million net debt by $90 billion. In addition to that, we are now able to invest for the future with a Future Fund - which has never been done before in Australia and never could have been done before in Australia - to pick up a liability which the Commonwealth has never provisioned for and begin to fund it.The government has put in place measures designed to protect this fund against raids from future governments because, whatever people think, it is possible that sometime between now and 2040 the Labor Party could get into office. That is why a fund which is being set up for 2040 has to be protected against the possibility of any future Labor government. - The Future Fund Bill provides the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer with the power to issue written directions on the investment. The intention is to guide the board and express government's preferences for risk. But the investments will not be made by the government. - The government will not be making specific directions or specific investment decisions. It will set out its expectations for long-term reforms and any restrictions on the board for policy reasons. The board will retain autonomy in choosing investments. Can I also say that the legislation provides that no money can be drawn out of this fund until the assets of the fund meet the liabilities for which they are being provisioned or until 2020.Since the opposition seems so concerned about raids on the Future Fund, the only person, to my knowledge, who has yet made a promise to raid the Future Fund was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, who has already promised his first raid to try to fund a promise in relation to the Pacific Highway. - The Leader of the Opposition has already made his first promise to raid the Future Fund, a fund which he never had the wit to set up and a fund which never would have been set up under him. - I was not aware that he made a promise to raid the Future Fund in the Adelaide Advertiser as well, but I will go to the clippings for that as well. This is a bear who cannot keep his paws off honey. Wherever he finds money, he thinks honey, and he is doing it in relation to the Pacific Highway and you will find he is doing it in Adelaide as well.</DOC>

 - I would be concerned about any job losses in regional Australia. Let me say in relation to Manildra and ethanol that the difficulties in that industry are overwhelmingly due to the outrageous fear campaign run by the Labor Party two years ago. The Labor Party, under the leadership of the member for Hotham, aided and abetted by the then member for Werriwa and the current member for Brand, were trying to allude to some kind of corrupt association - that is what they were trying to do; they used parliamentary privilege to denigrate a decent Australian businessman, Dick Honan. It got so bad that, after the last election, the former member for Bowman and the now member for Batman went around the Labor Party saying, 'You've got to change your policy on ethanol.' That is what they did. What they did two years ago was an outrageous use of parliamentary privilege in trying to destroy the reputation of a decent, courageous Australian businessman, Dick Honan. It is all right to attack me or any of us under parliamentary privilege - we are fair game - but it is not all right to use parliamentary privilege to destroy the reputation of a businessman, which is exactly what they did. By their silence they testify to their guilt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. As the honourable member well knows, avian influenza will be a disease that threatens the world, including Australia, for some time to come, even over a period of years. Australia's front-line agriculture and health agencies are better placed than at any time previously to deal with an outbreak, however unlikely it is that it will occur. The simulation last week, under the banner of Operation Eleusis, involved some 1,000 people across all jurisdictions, including the major poultry industries. It was vital that those networks of all of those people be developed as part of the exercise if we are to deal to the greatest effect possible with any outbreak of avian influenza.What we take away from the simulation is a much better understanding about how key decision makers from agriculture and health agencies can work together, especially in conjunction with those out in the field. The areas identified as part of Eleusis for further improvement will be improved so as to provide all Australians with the best possible defence and response to a bird flu incident of that kind, should it ever occur. Eleusis also showed that industry's role is critical in the decision-making processes and in implementing response plans.In summary, Eleusis was a success. It builds on progress achieved in this area over many years and remains an area of major focus for the government. What we learn from Eleusis will be captured and used to improve our response plans. I am confident that Australia has one of the best emergency animal disease infrastructures in the world, even as we strive to improve it even more.</DOC>

 - As has been clearly identified on many occasions during the course of this debate, the Australian government did not negotiate the contracts; the AWB did. The AWB negotiated those contracts with the Iraqi Grains Board. The contracts were certified by the United Nations under the section 661 sanctions committee -  - I am advised that the certification that DFAT did on the contracts was in the structure of the contracts, not the content in terms of values. The mission in New York -  -  - I have been advised that the mission in New York certified that they had been appropriately filled out in terms of the conditions of the UN oil for food program. The department was not involved in the negotiations on the price or conditions of those contracts. As I said yesterday, that information was commercial-in-confidence and it was not made known to the government. The most important point to make in this debate is that all this information has been put through the Volcker inquiry -  - The member for Griffith produced information in the MPI yesterday about an inquiry into weapons of mass destruction which found some information. That has all been taken into account through the Volcker inquiry and the Volcker inquiry found no wrongdoing by the Australian government. The Australian government has now set up a commission of inquiry with wide-ranging powers. If the member for Griffith has allegations to make about the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, he should make them to that inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. Today I had the great privilege of introducing a bill containing the most significant reforms in the family law system in some 30 years. These changes are not about parents' rights; they are about the right of a child to grow up in a safe environment with the love and support of both a mother and a father. This bill, along with an unprecedented injection of funding, is helping to change the culture of how we deal with family breakdown in Australia. We want to move away from the culture of Dreamworld dads and Movieworld mums and have parents who share the burden and the enjoyment of raising children.I want to take the opportunity to thank the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which produced an excellent report in a very short period of time on the exposure draft of the Family Law Act. - In relation to the report on the exposure draft bill, the government will be implementing 53 of the 58 recommendations of that report. I thank the member for Fisher and his colleagues on this side of the House. But I also thank the member for Denison, the member for Lowe and the member for Chifley, who supported those recommendations. But I note that there has been a lone voice - and I hear it again - from the member for Gellibrand, who seems to have a dissenting view. Of course, she is the shadow Attorney, and this poses the question of what the Labor Party policy will be on family law. Will it be the view of the shadow Attorney, the member for Gellibrand, or is it going to be the view of the Labor members who supported the committee recommendations that are being implemented today? I hope - and I am going to give plenty of time for consideration of this measure - the members of the opposition will take the time to think constructively and work out a unified position on this matter. The government knows where it stands on this question. We are getting on with the business of implementing the biggest changes to family law in 30 years. - </DOC>

 - In response to the first part of the question, I refer to my earlier answer on this almost exact question some weeks ago. I stand by that earlier answer. The Chairman of the Wheat Export Authority has addressed this issue in Senate estimates and advised that the WEA did not assess the internal transport costs of AWB's contracts in Iraq. This is an issue that has been canvassed at length. It is like Groundhog Day. The opposition must truly be running out of questions. In regard to the latter part of the member's question, asking about the WEA confidential reports to the minister for agriculture, in actual fact those confidential reports to the minister for agriculture say what is in the public report of the WEA and do not contain the sort of information implied in the honourable member's question.

 - It is certainly appropriate at the end of the parliamentary year to look back on some of the real achievements in transport reform over the last 12 months. The honourable member for Hume has been amongst the people who have been at the forefront of demanding additional expenditure on road projects and ensuring that we get our transport system working efficiently.One of the highlights is the $12.7 billion AusLink agreement, for which we now have agreements with the ACT, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. Each of these jurisdictions recognises that by working together we can achieve some really worthwhile things in transport reform. A good example of what AusLink can achieve will be demonstrated when Westlink M7 opens in Sydney next week. That will be a very important occasion for Sydney. I know that local members, like the members for Macarthur, Greenway, Lindsay, Mitchell and others, will really notice the improvements that can be made to Sydney traffic flow when that road is opened.It is interesting to note that that road, which is over 40 kilometres, will mean motorists will be able to avoid 48 separate sets of traffic lights. This project has been undertaken by the private sector with federal government support. In contrast to the sorts of projects that the New South Wales Labor Party government manages, this project was finished well ahead of schedule, months ahead of schedule. It is a quality job. The road has not fallen in. There have not been secret kickbacks on tunnels and all those sorts of things. It is a job that has been done well and done on time.We have also been working very comprehensively on rail transport. For the first time, significant Commonwealth investment has been made in rail transport. Three Alliance contracts, totalling more than $900 million, will make a really big impact on the north-south rail network. I hope that in the year ahead we might be able to complete the negotiations to give us a seamless rail network from Brisbane to Perth, which will destroy one of the great pieces of Australian historic folklore - all the rail barriers that have got in the way.The government have got on the job with road and rail transport. We have delivered the goods. By contrast, all Labor has been able to manage is a promise for a new bureaucratic organisation called Infrastructure Australia. Where is it going to get its money from? It is going to raid the Future Fund. That is all Labor is able to do in relation to transport - raid a fund that it cannot touch for 40 years anyhow, so there will be an enormous pause in the delivery of rail and road transport projects under Labor.Labor has nothing to contribute to the debate. We have got on with the job. We are delivering and we will do a whole lot more in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - I do not know what took place in the discussions between representatives of the AWB and the Iraqi Grains Board during that meeting. Can I say, though, that all of this trade was undertaken under the scrutiny of the United Nations both in New York and, I am advised, in Iraq, with UN customs people on the ground in Iraq as the product arrived. What took place in the discussions between AWB and the Iraqi Grains Board at the time is a matter that is best known to them.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and note the very high number of innovative businesses that are in his electorate and electorates right around Australia, including those of members on the other side. Under this government, Australia's innovation performance is very impressive and growing. According to the latest figures from the ABS, business expenditure on research and development has reached a record $7.2 billion in 2003-04. It represents the fourth consecutive year where investment in R&amp;D by business has increased.This has not happened by accident. It has happened not only as a result of businesses being confident in the economy and being prepared to invest in R&amp;D but also because, since 2001, the Howard government has committed an unprecedented $8.4 billion to science and innovation through two Backing Australia's Ability programs. Importantly, this investment has carefully targeted businesses to turn clever Australian ideas into commercial products.We do not have to look any further than upstairs in the Mural Hall this week in Parliament House. We saw a great Western Australian company called QRSciences launch their revolutionary explosive detection system, developed with the help of two grants from the Commonwealth government totalling some $3.7 million. The machine developed by QRSciences can detect a range of explosives in airports that could easily go unnoticed with conventional scanning technology. Two of these machines have already been installed in Australia, and I am pleased to report that there is substantial interest in the technology from right around the world.QRSciences' invention is a great example of what can be achieved when Australian ingenuity is backed by practical government support. I suggest that it is also a useful case study for those who sit opposite, who seem incapable of coming up with any practical, commonsense solution on innovation policy. We all remember, but could not understand, the very complex flow charts of 'noodle nation'. In last year's election campaign, Labor was forced to dump its 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession plan because it feared that it could not control the cost blow-outs of that proposal.While the opposition sit there and continue to confuse the innovative companies of Australia with a range of policies which they have to withdraw, this government, the Howard government, continues to get on with the job of helping clever companies to commercialise their inventions, earn export income and provide jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I commence my answer by pointing out to the member for Griffith that it has not been established that AWB paid any kickbacks. It has been alleged, but it has not been established. I make that the first point. Let me make it very plain to the House that at no stage has this government behaved improperly, wrongly or hypocritically in relation to this matter. That is more than can be said -  - If I may continue, Mr Speaker, it is more than can be said for the member for Griffith. It is very interesting. We have had a series of questions. - We have had a series of questions from the member for Griffith about the events of 2002, when the representatives of the Australian Wheat Board - and we all remember it - went to Baghdad to talk to the Iraqi Grains Board about a possible suspension of wheat sales to Iraq from Australia. At that particular time, all of the blame for that hold-up was being heaped upon the heads of the government, particularly the foreign minister. When the Wheat Board successfully negotiated a resumption of wheat sales to Iraq, do you know what the reaction was? - Of course he is on his feet. The reaction - listen to this, Mr Speaker. - Mr Speaker, that issue having been resolved, do you know what the member for Griffith did? He issued a -  - This is what the member for Griffith had to say. I invite the House to listen carefully. He said:The Federal Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the likely resumption of Australian wheat -  -  - This news release by the member for Griffith goes on. Having welcomed the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the resumption of wheat sales, he goes on to say:The Opposition congratulates the AWB for achieving a commercial outcome in the midst of the difficult foreign policy environment, which had been delivered to them by Foreign Minister Downer.In other words, in 2002, you, having blamed the government for the difficulty -  - The basis of the allegation made by the opposition is that a corrupt outcome had been achieved between the AWB and the then government of Iraq, yet in 2002 the member for Griffith said it was a sound commercial outcome. So what was a commercial outcome in 2002 has become a corrupt outcome in 2005. -  - In 2002, when these wheat sales were resumed, the member for Griffith applauded the resumption of the wheat sales. -  - The questions asked by the member for Griffith are a classic demonstration of the reality in public life that sometimes you can talk too much.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I will give it my best shot. I want to wish the member for Makin a very merry Christmas and a happy new year. It is the season of goodwill. -  The member for Lowe then left the chamber. 
 - As David Gower said, it is all about timing! As part of the goodwill of the season, the Minister for Workforce Participation just had a baby. He complained to me about the form -  - It is a Christmas miracle! His wife had the baby, I should say. But it did not stop the minister from complaining about the form he had to fill out to claim the maternity payment. We listen to those concerns on this side of the House. That is why, from March next year, we are abolishing a form that is nearly 29 pages long and replacing it with a three-page form and a simple question - so it is easier for people to claim it. Abolishing those seven million pages of forms is part of the Christmas present from the coalition to the Australian people - cutting red tape. But we can go further. -  - There is more! It is Christmas time. No-one can explain to me why, if you lose a credit card, you can just ring up the bank and get a new card, but, if you lose your Medicare card, you have to go into the Medicare office, fill out a form and send it somewhere else. From next year we are going to abolish two million forms. If people are going to change their address, we are going to abolish another one million forms for that as well. Abolishing 10 million pages of forms, cutting red tape - that is what Christmas is about: goodwill to all, goodwill to Australians!</DOC>

 - The Cole inquiry has been established as a result of the findings of the Volcker inquiry. The Volcker inquiry -  - found that there was no evidence to support the allegations against the AWB. There is no proof that the AWB was involved in giving kickbacks. The rhetoric of the opposition is therefore totally unjustified. The terms of reference of the Cole inquiry are that there should be an investigation as to whether any of three companies named by Volcker in fact breached any aspect of Commonwealth or state law. I do not believe that the terms of reference should be widened, because there is no basis on which to justify widening those terms of reference. - Not only was there an acknowledgement in the Volcker inquiry that there was no evidence that the AWB had been involved in kickbacks -  - but there was absolutely no adverse reference to the Australian government or any official -  -  The member for Perth then left the chamber. 
 - As I demonstrated earlier in question time, three years ago the member for Griffith applauded the commercial good sense of the AWB. Three years later, because of the opportunist he is, he is seeking through false allegations to blacken the reputation not only of the members of my government but also the members of the Australian Wheat Board.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question on something relating to the economy. For the last two weeks we have been in here - we are supposed to have 10 questions a day - the Labor Party has made it through without asking a question on the economy, on interest rates, on industrial relations or on jobs. You've made it: you've got to Christmas without having to say anything relevant to the Australian population - merry Christmas!Today we are here to talk about choice. We heard earlier on, and we have heard over the last two weeks, about how industrial relations was going to be a nightmare for the Australian population. We have heard how kids were going to be without families and how families were going to break up. We heard the same when the government brought in the first round of industrial relations reform. Those of us who were here remember the same with the GST. And when we brought in choice, having made this a coalition policy in 1995 and implemented it in July 2005, Kim Beazley, the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, put a little flier out saying, 'Small business faces superannuation chaos'. He also said things like, 'No-one has acknowledged what a red-tape nightmare this will be'. He went on to actually lambast superannuation choice, because he believes the choice that the Australian worker should receive is a choice determined by a union and an industry fund. That is choice in Labor's terms: not letting the workers of Australia choose. This side of the House actually believes they have the capability to choose for themselves, and they have done so.It was interesting to read the Financial Review today. Unlike the little fliers - the little bits of bad news signed by the Leader of the Opposition - we have the headline: 'Everyone's a winner in transition to choice era'. That is the Financial Review giving it the thumbs up. Why are they a winner? They are a winner because people have lower fees, better service, greater choice and a greater return on their savings, which means they can have the sort of retirement they deserve, rather than the sort of retirement the Labor Party would inflict upon them, without choice. It has also meant that we have new entrants into the superannuation market - low-cost entrants like Virgin Money and max Super, two great examples of companies which are providing greater choice to Australian workers. So, as the Australian people head into Christmas time, they will know that this government will continue to provide choice, low interest rates, more jobs and a stronger economy, and they will know that the Labor Party will never talk about the issues of concern to them.</DOC>
