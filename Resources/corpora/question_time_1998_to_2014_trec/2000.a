 - I thank the honourable member for her question. There are several parts to that. The public health goods that were GST free came out of the recommendation of the Vos committee. That had three people on it, one of whom was Professor Judith Whitworth, the Director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, formerly the Commonwealth's Chief Medical Officer and a person whom the Labor Party appointed to be head of the Medical Research Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I simply took the committee's advice, and she has said she does not see any reason for extending it to other goods.The second point is on health. People will be paying about $100 million of tax under these changes, but compare that to Labor's policy of a wholesale sales tax that has $820 million of tax on it. The fact is the GST removes $720 million of tax on health products, and if you look at the whole package it is exceedingly good for women and families. When people go past the scare campaign being run by the government and look at the whole package, I think they will be very happy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for the question. There are many ways in which Australians have benefited from the government's economic plan over the last four years, and clearly the way in which that benefit is most easily identified is the fact that we have seen the creation of almost 600,000 jobs since this government came to office. The most effective way of seeing that the benefits of economic change are spread is to provide jobs for those Australians who do not now have them and who are looking for them. On that measure, this government's record has been quite outstanding. We have generated 596,400 jobs and, as of 1 July, there will be another very widely enjoyed benefit. That is the benefit of tax reform. The average Australian family will be $47 a week better off as a result of taxation reform as from 1 July.The real benefit of tax reform will be enjoyed after 1 July when the Australian public sees the benefits of the income tax cuts, the benefits of the increase in family benefits, the increases in pensions and the compensation to self-funded retirees. When you match all of those benefits against the rearrangement of the indirect tax system, there will be enormous benefits, to the tune of $47 a week on average for an Australian family, $12 billion of personal income tax cuts and cheaper fuel in regional areas. There will be lower export costs and lower operating costs for Australian business.There have been many other benefits for the Australian community over the last four years. As a result of the economic conditions we have put in place, there has been a saving of $10,000 on an average loan of $100,000 over 25 years taken out in March 1996. Even after the increase last month in official interest rates, the average monthly saving on an interest bill has been $266 a month over and above what it was in March 1996. We have seen very high levels of sustained growth. We have seen headline inflation kept at 1.8 per cent compared with an inflation average of five per cent under the former government. Unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition. Since March 1996 employment has grown by almost 6,000, and unemployment in January was 6.8 per cent, which was just over the level of 6.7 per cent, the lowest since June 1990.This government's economic policies have provided great benefits to all sections of the Australian community. I acknowledge that there are some sections of the Australian community in the cities and in the regions who are not enjoying the same benefits as many of our fellow Australians are. It is the responsibility of governments to do what they can to ensure the benefits are fairly and evenly spread. By any generic measure, this is a more prosperous, a more stable, a more fully employed, a more equal and a fairer society than it was in March 1996. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I will go to the various parts of the question. The reason why I strongly advocated the deed of arrangement was that I believed that, on the advice available to meincluding advice based on a letter from the administrator to the Department of Workplace Relations, Employment and Small Businessentering into the deed of arrangement was the quickest and most effective way for the workers to get their entitlements. That is why I advocated that deed of arrangement. I make no apology for advocating that deed of arrangement. It was not designed to protect my brother; it was not designed to protect any of the other directors. I would remind the House that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has very wide powers of investigation, including the imposition of civil penalties, including the recovery of compensation and including criminal prosecutions. At no stage has any attempt been made to protect anybody, and I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, as late as 8 February, he was in fact advocating that we should provide financial assistance to National Textiles.It is very strange that, having done exactly what we were asked to do, and that is to pick up the entitlements of the workers, I am now getting criticised for having done that. The reality is that we were driven on all occasions by a concern for the retrenched workers. That was the motivation in my mind, that was the motivation in the minds of the cabinet, and I totally reject the smear cast by the Leader of the Opposition in his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can report to the House that, in the year 2000, the Australian economy enters the new century as a high growth, low inflation and higher productivity economy. Inflation through the year to the December quarter was 1.8 per cent. That compares with the average in the 1980s of 8.1 per cent per annum. The only way in which inflation was brought to heel by the Labor Party, as we know, was through its policy of putting Australia into recession. Even allowing for the recession which the Labor Party said we had to have, the average inflation rate under Laborincluding its recession yearswas 5.2 per cent. When the government came to office, unemployment was 8.5 per cent. It is now 6.8 per cent, and productivity growth has edged up from an average of 1.5 to 2.7 per cent. You will see a lot of commentary on the state of the Australian economy, but I came across one recently that said this:The Australian economy is clearly characterised by strong economic growth, low inflation, moderate wage growth and improved international competitiveness. Unemployment over the past year has also declined remarkably, with the strength of Australia's labour market performance showing encouraging signs for the year ahead.I quote from the ACTU in its 1999-2000 living wage claim. This is the trade union movement that controls the Labor Party, the puppet-masters for the leader and the deputy leader. This is what the trade union movement said of the government's economic performance:The Australian economy is clearly characterised by strong economic growth, low inflation, moderate wage growth . . . improved international competitiveness. Unemployment over the past year has also declined remarkably... The verdict of the ACTU. The Labor Party are yet, of course, to publish any economic policy. They have been in opposition now since March of 1996. The new shadow Treasurer is yet to make a speech on the economy. They will sleaze around on every issue except the big onesno ideas on employment, no ideas on inflation, no ideas on growth, no ideas on economic policy, barrelled by their own masters in the trade union movement, the ACTUand while they fail this government continues to deliver.</DOC>

 - I am aware that what I and the other members of the government have done on this occasion is act in a way that guaranteed that those workers got their full entitlements, and I am unashamed of that. We have been prepared to do things in this area that you never did in 13 years. You left thousands and thousands of workers without their entitlements. Like the Johnnys-come-lately you are on this subject, you now pose your great compassionate concern for the workers who are left without their entitlements. Your own leader was up there in Rutherford, without let or hindrance, with no reference to conflicts of interest, yelling at me to go and do exactly what I did, and now you are trying to sleaze around and pretend that in some way the thing is improper. We acted to protect the interests of the workers. Those directors can be investigated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. That commission has the capacity to impose civil penalties, to take criminal proceedings, to require compensation. To suggest that we were motivated by anything other thanas your question impliesa desire to help those workers for the reasons I explained is absolute nonsense.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I will come to the latter part of his question about existing schemes in a moment. In fact, I have a letter which will give the House a clear understanding of the history of this particular issue, going back in time. In respect of the first part of his question on the scheme, I am delighted to be able to say to the House that, as from 1 January, we now have a scheme in place which finally provides workers with some reassurance about their entitlements. For all the talk and claimed concern about workers, the fact is that no workplace relations minister and no government until this government was actually prepared to face up to a hard issue and do something for employees in this situation. What incredible hypocrisy and ignorance for the Leader of the Opposition to say what he said yesterday. When he was asked, `Why didn't you do something about this?' he said, `Well, this is a pretty recent sort of development.' He went on to say, `No, I'm not saying it hasn't happened before, but there has been a marked change in the last four or five years quantitatively.' My word there has been a marked change. We have virtually halved the rate of corporate insolvencies since he was the minister for employment, when a lot of people lost their entitlements. The hypocrisy of these people has no bounds. The reality is that they were out there publicly demanding that the government take action as from 1 January with a scheme to protect employees' entitlements. What incredible hypocrisy and political opportunism is it for them to ask the sorts of questions they have asked today. The implication of those first two questions was that the deed of arrangement ought to go down. Do you know that one of the implications of the deed of arrangement going down, putting aside National Textiles, on the advice from the administrator, is that 250 people will lose their jobs in Tasmania in a related firm? We are actually concerned not just about National Textiles but about those 250 jobs as well - not the political opportunism of yours but the reality of our responsibility to be concerned about those workers. I said in the parliament on 31 August:The intention of the government in respect of our legislative scheme is to work to put a national scheme in place by 1 January. We now have such a scheme. In fact, we had advertisements in the press on the weekend giving people some details and a reference point at which they can make inquiries. I think it is a very fair scheme indeed. It provides minimum entitlements up to four weeks in respect of unpaid wages, four weeks in respect of annual leave -  - Five weeks in respect of pay in lieu of notice and redundancy, and of course long service leave. This is the first such scheme we have had in Australia, with a maximum of up to $20,000, providing therefore a maximum of 29 weeks at ordinary time rates.Let me conclude with some further remarks in regard to the history of this particular issue and the policy of it. Back in 1988, prior to the recession that we had to have, the Harmer Law Reform Commission in fact examined this issue. The Labor Party, unlike the Labor Party today, then had a very clear policy on the central issue which the Labor Party is now advocating, namely, a wage earner protection fund as an alternative to priority of employee benefits. This is what was said in 1988 on this very issue in a submission to the Law Reform Commission:This would require contribution from all employers, employees and government. It would impose an unfair burden on the greater proportion of employers who conduct their businesses efficiently. It is also not considered that employees should bear part of the burden of inefficient trading.The party which then opposed the establishment of a national scheme was none other than the Labor Party in government. It was none other than a person who was later the Treasurer but who at the time held the job that I have now got. He was then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. It was Ralph Willis. The Labor Party in government was totally opposed to doing anything for workers. When the history of this is written, people will remark on the fact that economic mismanagement led to one million people unemployed, the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression, the worst economic circumstances that Australia had seen in 60 years and thousands of businesses going broke, yet in government it never lifted a finger. It found care and concern for workers only when it thought it could score a political point out of it. We are proud to have taken a decision to provide the first extension of the safety net for workers since superannuation. This is a real plus for workers, and I am pleased that it is a coalition government that is actually prepared to do something for workers. </DOC>

 - I have indicated in the press conference that I have already had that during the trip I was taking around Australia my brother rang me and, as I said on that occasion and I repeat now, generally briefed me on the situation regarding the deed of arrangement. I have already indicated that. To the best of my recollection, that was the only occasion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government's information program now involves tax help hotlines. It involves business assistance. It involves a train the trainer program. We now have a web site with the Australian Taxation Office which has had some millions of hits. ShortlyI am sure this will have the support of the oppositionthere will be more television advertising to explainOpposition members - Oh! - I took from their interjections that they thought there should be increasing informational campaigns and inserts in national, regional and local newspapers. Morgan and Banks recently surveyed 3,200 businesses regarding tax reform, and that showed that over 90 per cent of businesses are confident of being prepared for the new system. In every state and territory the result was over 90 per cent. For small business it was 91.2 per centa little more confident than in relation to big business. I note for interest that, out of the 20 industries surveyed, the industry least confident about being prepared for the new taxation system was the media. No doubt their employees will be counselling management on how to get ready for the new taxation system over the months to come.This is a taxation change that has been put in place by some 150 countries in the world. A value added tax or GST is now applied in France, Germany and the whole of Europe, most of Asia, in Japan, China and Singapore. Apart from Botswana and Swaziland, joined by the Australian Labor Party, countries in the world have given away wholesale sales tax.  - The United States does not have a wholesale sales tax, which is only supported by Swaziland, Ghana and the shadow Treasurer! I was a bit concerned to be contacted today by a chartered accountant, who had received an extraordinary email from Gary Waldron, the Vice-Chairman of the Victorian Institute of Chartered Accountants, who has apparently emailed accountants in Victoria with the following email:The institute met this week with the Victorian Minister for Small Business, Marsha Thomson, to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern to constituents in small to medium-sized business enterprises. The minister indicated, not surprisingly, that the number one issue in the small business sector at present is the introduction of the GST. The minister indicated she and her officers were in constant contact with the federal ministers, departments and the Australian Taxation Office.To my knowledge, I have never met Marsha Thomson and I doubt that I would be able to pick her out in a lineout. The email went on to say:The minister sought from the institute and its members' assistance in providing anonymous but real life hardship cases which she could draw upon when making representations to her federal counterparts.Anonymous, real life hardship cases! She has never made a representation to me to my knowledge, nor to my colleagues to my knowledge. The only federal counterparts to whom she is seeking to make representations are her frontbench colleagues of the Labor Party on an anonymous basis, not because they are interested in education but because they are interested in obfuscation and spreading confusion. The Australian Labor Party stands absolutely condemned by this hypocrisy. There are at least 150 countries in the world which have a value added tax or GST. Why would the Institute of Chartered Accountants be party to a scam like this? We now have evidence that the state Labor Party is deliberately trying to engage in anonymous complaint making. At the end of the day, what does all this add up to? The Australian Labor Party is so opposed to the GST that, if it ever gets elected, do you know what it wants to do? Keep it. It is so opposed to it that its policy is to try to get elected and to keep it. This is a group of people with no policy who want the government to do all of the hard work and lazily slip into office and try to take benefit. We will not be allowing it.</DOC>

 - I will check my files, but I am not aware that I received any written advice regarding that. I know from my own understanding of how these things work that it was better for the workers if a deed of arrangement was signed quickly. Indeed, that was the substance of the advice given by the administrator. Anybody who understands the operation of these things will know that in this particular case, if the company had proceeded to liquidation, there would have been two consequences. One of those consequences would have been that the workers would have got a lot less money. Presumably that is what the Leader of the Opposition wantedthat these workers did not get their full entitlement. One has to keep coming back to that central, unavoidable issue that the whole line of questioning from the Leader of the Opposition is designed to denigrate what the government has done to help the workers formerly employed by National Textiles. That is inevitably where your behaviour is leading. The Leader of the Opposition ought to tell the House - I have already indicated that I will check my records, but I am not aware of any particular advice before the Williamtown meeting. I do know and did know then that if you want to get a good, 100 per cent deal for these workers and get it quickly you have a deed of arrangement. That is why we insisted on it and, incidentally, that is why the New South Wales government wanted a deed of arrangement. What seems to be forgotten is that Bob Carr is a 50 per cent partner, along with the federal government, in helping these workers. He wants a deed of arrangement. The reason he wants a deed of arrangement is that it is the best way to get a quick outcome for the workers. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Leader of the Opposition wants to do these workers in the eye.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, there is no doubt that rural and regional Australians will benefit from the fixing of our broken tax system. There is our approach, which is one of a lower tax takeand it needs to be remembered that we will be collecting less taxor there is the ALP's approach, the one they go on defending, which is a broken tax system, a higher tax system and a tax system which discriminates against exports and against the interests of rural and regional Australians. For a start, there are the biggest reductions we have ever seen proposed in this country in transport costs. The cost of diesel to heavy transport will come down by 23c a litre. There will be the abolition of the 22 per cent WST on transport, something that we do not hear enough of. That will make a huge difference to the cost of transport across rural and regional Australia and, therefore, to the price of everything that rural and regional Australians need, whether it is the Kellogs pack in the local grocery store or the fertiliser for the paddock. Rail costs will come down dramatically. Rail costs will be effectively free of excise. All businesses will get cheaper fuel because the GST is rebated as a business input.Mr Speaker, it is worth noting as well that households and families working in rural and regional areas will benefit very substantially from the income tax cuts. There is a little town in my electorate that featured on the front page of the Daily Telegraph yesterdayCollarenebri. A single income couple, with a baby, in Collarenebri on $30,000 a yeara typical new family in that little townwill have an extra $65 a week in their home to spend. Fortuitously, that comes at the same time as indications in the last few days that their grocery bill on a weekly basis is likely to be considerably less. A working couple in Sale, in Victoria, with two children at school, on $40,000 a year - -  - They do not want to hear this. It is a typical situation where one partner has rejoined the work force. They will see an extra $46 a week in their pockets. A self-funded retiree couple on Queensland's Sunshine Coast with an income of $35,000 a year will find that they receive $13 a week in tax cuts plus more than $9 a week in increased allowances. Their less fortunate neighbours, a pensioner couple with about $15,000 of private income, will receive an increase of around $34 in social security payments under the new system. Those are the estimates by Access Economics, not by the government. They point clearly to the real advantages for people in rural and regional areas. At the same time, things like provisional tax will go and the burden of capital gains tax will be enormously reduced. This is in contrast to the ALP's approach. We saw, over the years that they were in government, fuel excise go from 7c a litre to 34c a litre. What's more, in 1993 they promised us -  - that they could deliver personal tax cuts. What did we get? We got an increase in wholesale sales tax -  - We got an increase of 10c on leaded and 5c on unleaded fuel as part of that dishonest 1993 budget that should never be forgotten. It is a broken tax system and they want to go on defending it. There is only one alternative; it is ours. It is a vastly superior alternative. </DOC>

 - It is my recollection that, at the time I attended the Williamtown meeting, there were press reports to the effect that the deed of arrangement might not be supported. It was no secret at that particular time that the unions were not in favour of a deed of arrangement unless they were to get their full entitlements. The two things naturally were things in my mind. I make no bones about the fact that when I met those workers in Williamtown I not only listened very carefully to their stories and was quite moved by the plight they found themselves in, and spent an hour with them, but I also did say to them that it was desirable that there be a deed of arrangement because - I did not know its contents.  - The reason I recommended it, Mr Speaker, is that I know for a fact that in these situations, if you want an early and quick return to the workers, you have a deed of arrangement. That is why I advocated it. -  - It is widely understood, quite separate and apart from the circumstances of this particular case, that in these situations deeds of arrangement speedily concluded will often produce a better outcome for employee entitlements than if the company goes into liquidation. That was clearly the case here. The conclusive point on this is that that was the view of the administrator. That was the view that the administrator put to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and it was the advice tendered by the minister at the cabinet meeting that this payment should be made subject to the conclusion of a deed of arrangement. For the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to suggest that the sole purpose, or the dominant purpose, of my advocating the deed of arrangement was a desire to protect my brother is wrong. I point out to them that they only lighted upon all of this after Mark Westfield wrote a piece in the Australian. Until then the Leader of the Opposition was not only advocating that I should ensure that the workers got their full entitlements as quickly as possibleand I knew that the quickest way of getting it was through a deed of arrangement but also, on 8 February, that the government provide financial assistance direct to National Textiles. That would have involved, undoubtedly, had it occurred, an allegation of providing direct assistance to the company of which my brother was chairman.The Leader of the Opposition has played `follow the media' on this issue. He criticised the failure to make disclosure of my involvement in the decision only after that became a subject of criticism in the media. Up until then he was demanding not only that I walk into the cabinet meeting and demand that there be the payment in full of the entitlements but also that the government bail out the company. I must say in this context that just before question time the transcript of the address that the Leader of the Opposition gave to the workers at Rutherford came into my possession. It makes very interesting reading. In the concluding paragraph he says that he goes back to the point he made at the beginning. The point he made at the beginning was that we should be keeping the company going. The only way you can keep the company going is to inject money into it. He said:I really do hope that the Prime Minister sits down, or perhaps he might have to declare an interest in this regard in relation to That is fine, of course. He went on to saythis makes fascinating reading and I ask the House to bear with me as I read it:The Deputy Prime Minister takes overand this is in relation to cabinet consideration not of the entitlements issue but, rather, of financial assistance to the companyas the Prime Minister excludes himself from the meetinglisten to this - having received prior instructions from the Prime Minister that the cabinet will start, as they're starting to, keeping National Textiles open.What the Leader of the Opposition was saying was that I should go through the pretence of leaving the cabinet but, on the way out, say to John Anderson, `You look after National Textiles.' These are the ministerial standards of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me read the transcript again:The Deputy Prime Minister takes over as the Prime Minister excludes himself from the meeting having received prior instructions from the Prime Minister that the cabinet will start, as they're starting to, keeping National Textiles open.Paraphrased, I pretend to exclude myself from the meeting and as I walk past the Deputy Prime Minister I say, `John, don't forget to look after National Textiles.' You are a hypocrite, Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I am aware of comments made recently on this issue. Last week there was an article in which it was reportedI think it was in the Australianthat the CEO of Telstra, Ziggy Switkowski, canvassed the partial floating of some of Telstra's business assets. Last Friday the spokesman for communications for the Labor Party, the honourable member for Perth, said in a doorstop that the opposition would not support such a move. The Leader of the Opposition thought somewhat differently. On the same day it was reported that he had indicated that the opposition may accept moves by Telstra to float off parts of its services. He put a couple of conditions on it, but he made it clear that they may accept that. I note that in that same doorstop the spokesman on communications indicated to Telstrain fact, repeated it on a number of occasionsthat Telstra should `get on with its business'. I would question how Telstra can get on with its business when Labor opposes not only the further privatisation of Telstra but also Telstra conducting its affairs to maximise its business opportunities in the interests of its shareholders under the Corporations Law, under the Telstra Corporation Act.In stark contrast to this, the government accepts that Telstra operates in what is a rapidly changing and increasingly globalised telecommunications industry. The government accepts that Telstra must have the flexibility to pursue its business opportunities as and when they arise. The irony of all of this is that we all know that Labor, if given the opportunity, would privatise Telstra. This was stated again by the spokesman on communications only last October. He said last October that before you would contemplate further privatisation of Telstra you would want to ensure that there was a fully competitive telecommunications market. That has been there for some time. It is on our television screens every night the offers that are being made and the prices that are continually being reduced for the benefits of consumers, and of course the government supports that also. In addition, we know that history is against Labor. The history of Labor is that they support privatisation. In fact, in the first part of the 1990s, Labor sold more than $6 billion worth of public assets under a schizophrenic policy position. They said, `We don't believe in privatisation, but we will sell the Commonwealth Bank; we don't believe in privatisation, but we will sell Qantas; we don't believe in privatisation, but we'll sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.' Who was the architect of all this? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition.The government has been up-front with the Australian people on its policies. We want to privatise Telstra further to ensure that the company can compete in a rapidly changing and increasingly globalised telecommunications industry. And we want to use the proceeds of such sale to retire Labor's debt and to give the opportunity for Australia to get much needed infrastructure development. On the other hand, we know that Labor will privatise Telstra. The sad truth about that is that they will not be honest with the Australian people and tell them that. </DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition now displays indignation and concern for small business, which of course were noticeably absent in some of the actions of the ACTU when he led it years ago. But I will pass that over. This cannot disguise the fact, and nothing can alter the reality, that the government supported the deed of arrangement. The New South Wales government supported the deed of arrangement. When I met the workers in Williamtown I advocated the deed of arrangement because I knew, and the government knew, that we really wanted to deliver the best return for the workers at the earliest possible date. My concern was not with Mr Bart; my concern was with the workers at National Textiles. - I have already said, but I am very happy to repeat, that we had advice from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, based, as I understand it, in turn on advice from his department, which in turn was prompted from communications from the administrator, that if you really wanted the optimum outcome for the workersand that is what we were concerned about; we were not concerned about the directors; we were concerned about the workersas we said all along, it should be conditional upon the entering into of a deed of arrangement because the general experience in these situations is that, if you want a quick and the fullest possible return for the employees, you have a deed of arrangement. The advice I saw on this was that if the company went into liquidationand I think some of this has been in the mediathe return for the workers would clearly be less and would be long delayed. In those circumstances, for us to advocate anything other than a quick deed of arrangement would have been plainly recreant to the concern that we had for the workers. That was always our consideration. This pathetic attempt today is not prompted by the thought processes of the Leader of the Opposition on the day. When the Leader of the Opposition responded to the announcement that I made on behalf of the government, he was not out there lecturing me on company law. He was not doing that. He was saying, `Oh, well, we the opposition forced the government to do this.' They had 13 years to do it themselves but they finally, from opposition, forced us to do it, they say. He had nothing to say about deeds of arrangement, nothing to say about corporate law, nothing to say about the directors; but he had a lot to say about the entitlements. This really gets down to a simple choice: does the Leader of the Opposition support bailing out the Rutherford workers, or does he want us to unpick the arrangement? Is the Leader of the Opposition out there saying, `Oh, no, this is a bad arrangement for the Australian taxpayer'? As for the confected indignation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about unsecured creditors, that would have to take the prize. He has never evinced any concern in the past about unsecured creditors, and it is a piece of rank opportunism that they get dragged into this debate. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, it is a well-known fact that prior to the last election we went into that election campaign committed to improving and modernising Australia's taxation system. Part of that process is unambiguously aimed at improving the circumstance, the productivity and the competitiveness of Australia's export industries. The taxation changes that we will be implementing shortly will see $3½ billion worth of indirect tax costs removed from Australia's export industries. It will make them much more competitive in a very tough global market. Part of that process will see the abolition of the wholesale sales tax that the Australian Labor Party has maintained and wants to keep. We will see the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate from the rail transport system, so critical to Australia's exporters: $80 million a year worth of cost taken out of the Australian rail transport system. We will see significant reductions in the cost of diesel fuel for the heavy road transport system23c a litreall accruing to provide a much more competitive base off which Australia's export industries can operate.We will see the removal of state based taxes, which will benefit Australia's export industries. Australia's export industries collectively acknowledge that the new taxation system that we are going to introduce on 1 July will improve their circumstances dramatically and will make them much more competitive in the international marketplace. They also know that there is no alternative to this. They know that the Australian Labor Party has offered absolutely no alternative to this. In 13 years in government, it did nothing like this that was going to improve the circumstances of Australia's exporters.I was at an exporting manufacturer in the seat of Farrer in Albury only last week. I went to visit a company that manufactures and exports Malibu boats. The owner of this business cannot wait for 1 July to arrive because, as he said to me, with the implementation of the GST he will be selling his boats in the year 2000 at 1997 prices. He cannot wait for it to get here. It will make him much more competitive in the international marketplace as he exports. - You go and ask him. They are not my words. The member for Cunningham should ask the member for Canberra beside him, because over the break the member for Canberra quoted that the GST overall will be good for exports. He has acknowledged it. -  - I beg your pardon: the member for Fraser has agreed that it is going to be good for exporters. He should try and convince the Leader of the Opposition to support the government's position on this because he has acknowledged that this is going to be good for exporters. And it will be good for the 1.8 million Australians whose jobs rely on exports. The jobs of one in five Australians rely on exports. We are securing their future by making the industries in which they work far more competitive on the international scene.I will finish on the point that was made to me in Alburythat this government has the answers for the future. It has a strategy for the future of Australian exporters. The Australian Labor Party does not.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. It enables me to make one or two observations in the course of answering. The first is that, if you lot were still in office, those workers would get nothing. That is the first observation to make. The second observation to make is that, if that closure has occurred since 1 January, in accordance with the announcement made by the minister they will be entitled to the benefit of the safety net scheme. The question of whether they, like the workers at National Textiles, will be entitled to anything in addition will depend on an assessment of their situation in accordance with some of the criteria I have mentioned. It will also depend somewhat on the attitude of the New South Wales government. - You had no policy on this. The Leader of the Opposition says that we have a new policy. At least we have a policy. Those who sit opposite had 13 years. As I indicated on 8 February and as the minister indicated, we have the safety net scheme in place from 1 January. Any top-up would be considered against the background of the criteria I outlined in that news conference. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the top-up in the National Textiles case involved a contribution of 50 per cent of the top-up by the New South Wales government.Obviously, the circumstances raised by the Leader of the Opposition in that particular case will be looked at and will be looked at by the minister in his normally careful and compassionate way. He has a concern. It remains to the very great credit of my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that he is the first minister with that responsibility in Australia to actually put in place a safety net scheme. Senator Tierney, the Liberal senator who is resident in the Hunter region, reported to our party room this morning that he spoke to a lot of the National Textiles employees at the weekend. He said they are very grateful for what the government has done - and they are rather upset at the attitude being taken by Kim Beazley.</DOC>

 - Earlier this afternoon, the December participation figures for private health insurance were released and they are great news. For the fourth quarter in a row, the number of Australians having private health insurance has gone up. This is the first time that this has happened in at least 17 years, and probably longer. At 31 December, just under six million Australians had private health insurance, an increase of 82,000 over the quarter. Interestingly, this is a quarter where you would not normally expect an increase. It was the end of the year. The government were not running their Lifetime Health Cover campaign and we had changed wholesale arrangements and we were expecting some people to drop out from private health insurance. It means that over the calendar year 1999 300,000 people net took out private health insurance. If we compare it to the status quo, which is having done nothingwhich would have been the Labor Party's planwe have over a million Australians now who have private health insurance who would not have had we not started our reform in the middle of 1997. Those reforms are: the 30 per cent rebate, Lifetime Health Cover, changed prudential arrangements, changed wholesale arrangements in private health cover, separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission, changes to gap cover, simplified billing, and changes to prostheses arrangements. There has been a large amount of work to do in this area. The honourable member asked me if I was aware of any other plan, and I have to say, `No, I am not.' I look at the Labor Party's 1998 health policy and there are a couple of paragraphs of platitudes and not one single idea. I look at the Labor Party's 1998 platform, and there are five lines on private health insurance and not one single idea. All we get from the Labor Party is carping, negative opportunism for an industry that is an integral part of our health system in Australia. This is a great result, given that lifetime health cover will be coming in over the next six months, and it gives us great optimism for the future for this very important part of the health system. Finally, with respect to my earlier answer, clearly it is the opposition who is running the scare campaign.</DOC>

 - I share the concern of the member for Gellibrand for those Braybrook workers. I also have a concern for the thousands upon thousands of similar workers in just as necessitous circumstances who got nothing when you were in office. It was always the case that we were going to run a scheme from 1 January, and that was acknowledged by none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who has sort of changed the goal posts twice a day on this issue over the last week. When he responded on 8 February to the announcement I made in relation to National Textiles, he had this to say: that Mr Reith had promised that we would have a national scheme in place by 1 January. He was not then saying a national scheme back to 30 June last year so that the Braybrook workers could be picked up. The difficulty is that, if we move back from 1 January, there is no logical reason why we should stop at 30 June. There is no reason why we should stop at 1 January. - Mr Speaker, we have made it clear all along that our scheme would start from 1 January, and that means that both elements of the scheme operate from 1 January. If you go back, there is no end to how far you go back. I would say yet again to the House that the Labor Party had 13 years to do this and they did nothing. Not only did they do nothing during 13 years but they actually argued that it was fundamentally unfair and irresponsible to do what we are now doing and what they urged us to do before 8 February. I would again remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition on 8 February said nothing about conflict of interest; he said nothing about going back; he merely sought to make the political point of the day and then, as other things came out in the media, in typical fashion he followed the media rather than generating any ideas of his own and demonstrated once again that on this issue he has no policy ideas, no sense of initiative and no sense of broad policy. We are the first government to have done something. We are proud of what we have done. We cannot go back beyond 1 January. What about the 441 workers at Budget Rent-A-Car who lost millions of dollars in the early 1990s? Did anybody opposite, when they were over here, do anything about that? Of course they did not. You are behaving in an opportunistic, hypocritical fashion on this. We are the first government to protect the interests of workers; we are proud of that, and no sleazy attempt to denigrate what we have done in relation to National Textiles is going to have any impact at all on the very strong and fair policies that the government has introduced. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I recognise the great contribution that he has made to the training system. The latest estimates suggest that there are around 140,000 new apprentices in traditional trades. That is growth of around 15 per cent since this government has been in office. We are very keen to see more of these apprentices in traditional trades, which have modernised and which offer really good starts to careers for young people. The government is working with the manufacturing, electrical and automotive industries to find ways to grow these numbers to further alleviate skills shortages in the traditional trades.This is a very significant turnaround from the time when the Labor Party was in office, and indeed from the time when the Leader of the Opposition was education minister for two yearstwo dead, wasted years in educational policy. When he was minister for education, the numbers in traditional apprenticeships collapsed. He was a disaster, as we know, in every portfolio he held. Before he moved on to the ministry of finance and pumped up the budget deficit, and fresh from concluding the Collins class submarine contracts, he paused for a couple of years in education. What did battleship Beazley achieve in education? He sank 20,000 traditional apprenticeships. His record in education was to destroy traditional apprenticeships. He has no credibility on education. He has no policy on education, and as the Sydney Morning Herald wrote in its editorial yesterday, he will not be credible as long as he relies on `uninformed populism rather than an informed reform agenda'.</DOC>

 - I thought the point I made about discussions with my brother was that we made it a rule not to go into detail about his business affairs. The test of whether I have behaved properly or improperly in this matter is a very simple one, that is, whether I have used my position as Prime Minister in any way to bring a preferment to my brother's business interests, or to the interests of companies for which he has responsibility, that they would not have otherwise received on the merits. That is the test. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition, and I put it to those around him, that he has produced not one scintilla of evidence alleging that he has received that.  - Those sitting opposite have not been able to establish that anything was done that produced an outcome that would not have otherwise occurred in accordance with the merits of the occasion. I would remind the House that the decision as to whether or not National Textiles and Bruck Mills should receive money under the textiles plan to facilitate a merger, a decision to reject what the companies sought, was made by Senator Minchin. At no stage did I seek in any way to influence that decision. In fact, I expressly told Senator Minchin that the decision should be made on the merits. When the decision went against the companies, there was no approach made to me by my brother, or anybody on his behalf, to revisit that decision. If that had occurred, there would be some substance in the allegations being made by the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged on a number of occasions that, in the normal course of events, all of us have relations who may be prominent in business and who may have dealings with the government. The test is whether they get preferment. On this occasion, there was no preferment. There was no favouritism and there was no advantage obtained by my brother. None of the money that we are paying out goes to my brother; none of it goes to the directors. In fact, the person in this place who has been advocating that money go to my brother's company is the Leader of the Opposition. Let me again return to this extraordinary transcript. This illustrates what the Labor Party means when you get at arm's length from something. An arms' length transaction by a Labor Prime Minister is that you pretend you are out of the room but, like a puppetmaster from outside, you are telling the Deputy Prime Minister what to do. This is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. Let me tell you again, Mr Speaker, what he had to say:I really do hope that the Prime Minister sits down ... He might have to declare an interest in this regard in relation to familial connects.That is what the transcript says. In reality I did, Mr Speaker. I described at some length the discussions that I had had with my brother regarding this issue, even though he is not, in accordance with the language of the cabinet handbook, a member of my immediate family and there is no economic dependency between the two of us. But, then, he goes on:The Deputy Prime Minister takes over, as the Prime Minister excludes himself from the meeting, having received prior instruction from the Prime Minister that the Cabinet will start, as they are, to keep National Textiles open.If you reverse the order so that you had Prime Minister Beazley and Deputy Prime Minister Crean and you are trying to help a company in which a relative of Prime Minister Beazley is involved, he will say, `Simon, I will go out of the room but you make sure you look after my brother's company.' Wink, wink, nod, nod: that is the standard of the Leader of the Opposition. Those may be the rules of the Balcatta branch of the Australian Labor Party, but they are not the rules of the Commonwealth government. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. The IMF today released in Washington its most recent consultation concerning Australia, noting that Australia `is a high growth, low inflation economy' and that `the strength of the Australian economy reflects improvements in the policy framework, including fiscal policies, medium-term orientation, inflation targeting and labour and product market reforms'. These are reforms put in place by this government. The IMF noted that strong growth and labour market flexibility had meant that unemployment was trending down. It noted that the repayment of Commonwealth net debt - this government's effort to repay Labor's debt - `had facilitated a fall in Australian interest rates towards international levels.' The IMF also said that `fiscal policy has also sought to improve economic efficiency through a landmark tax reform package and more recent business tax proposals.' The IMF described that landmark tax reform package as `improving the integrity and fairness of the tax system and reducing its complexity'. That is a direct endorsement by the International Monetary Fund of the government's policy in relation to tax reform. That backs up, of course, the OECD report in January 2000, which said that `the introduction of a more efficient tax system should help to consolidate the productivity gains that are now being seen.'When we look at tax reform internationally, we can see that there are now, I think, 150 countries in the world that have introduced a value added tax or GST. Australia's moves have been endorsed by the OECD and they have been endorsed by the International Monetary Fund. To my knowledge, the only political grouping out of step with world developments, apart from the authorities in Swaziland and in Botswana, are the modern thinkers of the Australian Labor Party. I make this point: just as the Labor Party fought every step of the way against fiscal consolidation and then said it was in favour of surplus budgets, so now it intends to fight every step of the way against tax reform and, if it ever gets elected, do you know what it intends to do with the GST? It intends to keep it. It intends to fight every step of the way and then to take the benefit of it. That is straight and complete opportunism. It is an elaborate cover for a failure to come to grips with any meaningful policy. The runs are on the board; the international organisations have endorsed the government's stand. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition, if he thinks he is a modern thinker, to produce one international body, an IMF or an OECD, that recommends the abolition of value added tax and the introduction of wholesale sales tax. I ask him to produce just one international endorsement of his policy to show that he is in step with somebody in the world, other than the countries of Botswana and Swaziland.</DOC>

 - As the one responsible for the tax system, I take great delight in answering tax questions in this place. -  - Mr Speaker, as somebody who is responsible for the overall administration of the tax system, I am quite happy to take that question on behalf of the honourable member. In relation to residential rents, the principle that the government has laid down is that they will be input taxed. That means that there will be no GST on the rent but there will be no credit for the inputs. That is the case which applies to boarding houses, accommodations and caravan parks. An additional administrative arrangement was introduced to give an election - if it would lead to lower compliance costs for those caravan park owners to claim the input tax credits but to be liable for half tax on the rentals, which should amount to the same amount in the legislation. But the general principle is that input taxation will apply.  - I hear one of the brains trust of the Labor frontbench say they are not GST free. There is a big difference - and I would advise the Labor Party to learn this difference - between GST free and input tax. -  - Mr Speaker, ironic cheers, as if this is news to them for the first time! What amazes me is how these people have been opposing for so long something they never understood and never had the energy to come to grips with. - I will finish that sentence, Mr Speaker. In relation to those items that are GST free, there is no liability on the output, and there is full input tax credit in relation to all of the inputs. The treatment of residential rents is the same in relation to boarding houses and accommodation - that is, as a general principle, they are input taxed. As I said earlier, that amounts to there being no liability on the rent, but there is no claim back in relation to the input tax credit - a system which applies more or less to the current taxation on rentals. In relation to this matter, the government has also indicated that not only will it be increasing allowances and pensions but it will be increasing rent allowances by up to seven per cent for all of those who are in private rentals who will be getting an increase in relation to their rent allowances to deal with any price increases - if there should be any - in relation to that treatment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can advise the House that, following an advertisement that was placed in papers on the weekend, the hotline that the department has established is now receiving calls from employees, many of whom we believe will be eligible for the national Employee Entitlements Support Scheme safety net provision. I advise the House that, as at about 12 noon today, we had had more than 85 calls. There was obviously a very keen interest from those making those calls in understanding the details of the scheme. I would hope that every member of the House would be pleased to hear that the advice we have from people taking the calls is that the overwhelming reaction has been one of a sense of relief that the government is prepared to try to give them some assistance. This is for people who have lost their jobs since 1 January and for whom, until the government made the decision that it did, there was absolutely no hope of any assistance when they had lost their employment. We are, of course, very interested to gauge the extent of reaction to the scheme that we have been putting in place. The reason for that is that there really have been no statistics available on the extent of the problem. This has been a hidden problem. This has been a problem about which the Labor Party was not even prepared to collect any statistics. This was a problem that the Labor Party hoped would stay stuck in a file, sitting on a shelf -  - You were hoping that no-one would ever take that file down from the shelf to actually ascertain the extent of the problem. You were never prepared to lift a finger, never prepared to actually collect the statistics, the data, on the extent of the problem. And why? Because for you this was a problem that did not exist. This was a problem that you did not want to know about. Last year, at this government's initiative, we established a research program to take those files off the shelves, which had gathered dust under Labor, to actually ascertain the extent of the problem. I can advise the House that we do have some early data. I received it in the last 48 hours, and it is subject to qualification in terms of the sample used and the like. My department advise me that they have been able to take out about 160 case studies over four different years demonstrating the extent of the problem. The early estimates - and I do say that they need to be treated with caution, and we will have some further data in due course - reveal the extent of employee lost entitlements to be about $5,006 per employee. This is relevant because one of the Labor Party's attacks on the government's program is that it is inadequate to deal with the issue.Mr Speaker, I will give you a case study of a person aged 45 and over, an employee in New South Wales on average weekly ordinary time earnings. All other things being equal, and based on advice that I have from my department, a person in that situation would receive a full payout of around $16,819 based on 22 weeks. If you apply our basic entitlements scheme - and on the advice that I have from my department given the particular circumstances of New South Wales and entitlements - a person in that situation would receive not their full entitlement of 22 weeks but a basic entitlement of 20 weeks and a figure of $15,290. So $15,200 compared to $16,800. That is a very generous scheme. It is a very fair scheme. It is not surprising, therefore, that we have people ringing up to say that this is finally giving them a glimpse of hope, that there is some assistance for them after having lost their jobs. The fact is that the Labor Party never collected any information on this whatsoever because they wanted it buried. They have never had a policy on this issue. They have been attacking our policy on the basis that we were making payments out of taxpayer funds to give these workers some assistance. When you were pressed on this you were saying, `Oh, no, our policy is an insurance scheme. What about these particular workers?' Two days ago you said, `You might choose to start off with a more generous component from the taxpayers to fix this up.' That is our policy that you have had the hypocrisy to be attacking. One minute the Labor Party are attacking our policy and the next minute they are agreeing with it. Just to cap it off - to show what an empty, vacuous person he is - when confronted about the details of his policy the Leader of the Opposition said two days ago, when he was actually pursued on the detail, `It's a pretty detailed suggestion, but it's no final cut.' It is certainly no final cut.  - I conclude by making this simple point: the Labor Party never had a policy on this issue when they were in government, because they were not interested in the circumstances of workers. When they are actually pressed on the issue now, they do not have a position that they are advocating; it is just `It's just a suggestion but we will have as many final cuts as suit us.' They had a bad day yesterday, so today they turn to disruption as their only answer.</DOC>

 - The ACCC's price exploitation powers are applied under the Trade Practices Act and they extend to businesses that are registered for GST purposes. In relation to the issue raised by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, I can inform him that the government is doing everything it can to provide the ACCC with appropriate powers. - Don't get too cocky, Simon. You haven't heard the answer. -  - At a number of points we have asked the states for additional referred power. However, in one situation a state is holding out. I have before me a letter from the Minister for Fair Trading of a particular state which I will read:Dear Mr Hockey,Thank you for your letter of 1 October 1999 relating to the States' roles in fielding fair trading complaints relating to the GST.In that letter you refer to discussions held at the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs regarding the implications of the New Tax System for Fair Trading Agencies. A proposal was put forward at that meeting - I might say it was put by me - that all States agree to support the proposal ... to refer to the ... (ACCC) the power to undertake enforcement action under State fair trading legislation in relation to GST related complaints.After further consideration of this issue, I have decided not to recommend to my Cabinet colleagues that the State of Queensland refer power to the Commonwealth in this area.I table the letter and point out that the Labor Party's colleagues are not giving us the power to do it. So you are hypocrites about this. Don't speak to us about it; go and speak to your Labor colleagues in the states.</DOC>

 - I refer to the reforms that were put in place in 1997 by this government. One of the reforms that was put in place was to establish a complaints resolution scheme, because previously there had been no formal scheme where complaints could be made by individuals, residents, their relatives and staff in a way that they would not feel intimidated. There was no formalised way of dealing with it, so the complaints resolution scheme was established.We have promoted this scheme, throughout residential aged care facilities, with posters and brochures and, indeed, during the earlier part of this year I promoted it personally. The success of the scheme has been that we have received some 4,000 complaints since its inception, of which over 90 per cent have been concluded to the satisfaction of all parties. That means we have 10 per cent that are extant - on foot, as it were. The scheme is working well and is part of a raft of oversighting mechanisms we have to ensure that there is good quality care for individual Australians in need of it.I wish to refer to a matter that was brought to my attention at 10 o'clock last night by the department. It concerned an event that was the subject of a serious complaint to the Victorian state office of the department. The department made a decision not to refer the matter to the standards and accreditation agency but to contact the provider and seek his response. The agency would have borne the responsibility of investigating the matter under the Aged Care Act and the principles to the act. Last night I had the central office of the department here in Canberra cause the Victorian office to refer the matter to the standards and accreditation agency and arrangements were put in place for a visit to take place at 9 o'clock this morning. Three nurses, one departmental officer and one agency assessor are in attendance. This inspection is still under way as I speak. My concern is that I want to be advised if there is an immediate or severe risk to individual residents. This conclusion will be taken by the delegate of the secretary to the department after receiving a report from the agency. If the judgment is that there is an immediate and severe risk, immediate action will follow. If there is a decision that there is not an immediate and severe risk, nonetheless the complaint will be pursued vigorously.I want to reiterate what I said to this House previously, that we have a number of tools available to us to ensure that residents of aged care facilities receive only the best care. The accreditation which is in place and up and running will mean that by the end of this year, by 1 January 2001, only people who reach accreditation standard will receive subsidies from the government. In other words, the sorts of people the Labor Party tolerated being in business will be out of the system. Under the previous system, I am told that facilities would not be visited for five-year periods. - The agency advises me that by the time this year is complete every facility will have been visited once and one-third will have been visited on more than one occasion. Part of the checks process that we have in place is for monitoring visits to take place and for continuing contacts to be made where facilities are discerned not to be up to scratch. I repeat what I said: we will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that those people who ought not to be giving care and ought not to be trusted with the care of older Australians are, by the time our process is complete, not in the system. More particularly, my concern is for individual older Australians and that they get good care.</DOC>

 - The answer to the third part is no. As to whether we have received a report, I have not personally seen such a report. Can I say generally that the treatment in relation to boarders - those that are in long-term residential situations - is input taxation. The current tax treatment of rents is input taxation under wholesale sales tax. You do not get any credits in relation to rent for wholesale sales tax paid on matters that are in the rental premises. It is precisely the same treatment which is being introduced in relation to GST. But there is one difference between the government and the opposition - - I was about to come precisely to that question, because there is one difference between the government and the opposition, which is: when the opposition was in power and increasing wholesale sales taxes, it never gave compensation to pensioners or people who were renting. Not once! Not only are we increasing pensions and family allowances and cutting income taxes but there is a seven per cent increase in the rental allowances. When the Labor Party increased all the wholesale sales taxes after that shameful 1993 budget, what was the increase in rental allowance given as compensation?Government members - Zero! - What was the increase in pension given as compensation?Government members - Zero! - What was the decrease in income tax given as compensation?Government members - Zero! - I can say this: compared to past practice in relation to the taxation tactics of the Australian Labor Party, boarders will be in a better position than they ever were under the tax system of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As you would expect in the biggest reform to the Australian taxation system, it is incumbent upon the government to educate not only those people that will be interacting with the taxation system but the public generally on those changes which affect them. Starting Friday week, there will be a significant roll-out of television, print and radio advertising with a number of different advertisements covering a range of themes. The first set will focus on the Australian business number, telling businesses where to get a registration kit. This will coincide with a major roll-out of registration kits, which will be available in every major bank, every newsagent and every post office. In addition, this will coincide with a major direct assistance program for businesses, particularly small businesses, guaranteeing answers to questions and also offering the opportunity, if they wish to take it up, of visits to businesses to assist them in registering and getting ready for the new taxation arrangements. The general booklets will be inserted in all major metropolitan, regional and suburban papers over the coming months. In addition, there will be other government departments which will be advertising other parts of the taxation changes. For example, the Department of Family and Community Services will be advertising those increases in family allowances and changes as families get bigger benefits, and also increases in pensions, rent allowances and the like. In addition, there will be an information campaign for self-funded retirees as to the savings bonuses that they will be eligible to claim to ensure that the value of their savings is maintained. In addition, of course, the government will be introducing the largest income tax cuts in Australian history, and it will be necessary for employers who are putting in place those tax cuts to have information on the tax cuts which will be available to the Australian public.This will be a major communication campaign, and obviously the opposition will support it, believing that it is necessary to provide information on the taxation changes, which involve changes to indirect taxes, which involve changes to Commonwealth-state relations, which involve the abolition of wholesale sales tax, which involve the abolition of other indirect taxes, which involve an increase in all family allowances, which involve savings bonuses for self-funded retirees, which involve increases in pensions, which involve increases in rent allowances and which involve the largest income tax cuts in Australia's history - a radical reform of the Australian taxation system to bring Australia with a modern taxation system into the new century.</DOC>

 - I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition brought his pyjama top into question time, but I really do not think it is your colour, Simon. I would have thought your colour would be definitely red, if not pink. -  - Some of my colleagues say that a peer of the realm would have blue pyjamas, but I think for an ACTU ex-president at least pink. In relation to taxation changes, the truth of the matter is that wholesale sales tax is abolished in its entirety, and in addition to that indirect taxes are abolished and embedded wholesale sales taxes -  - Embedded wholesale sales taxes which are currently built into prices will be reduced. That is the fact of the matter. Those embed - Not only is wholesale sales tax abolished in its entirety before goods and services tax of 10 per cent is levied but embedded wholesale sales taxes are also abolished. There will be embedded wholesale sales taxes throughout the transport distribution system. In addition, diesel fuel rebates and diesel fuel reductions will also be reducing transportation costs. That means the implementation of a 10 per cent value added tax but the reduction not only of direct wholesale sales taxes but also of embedded taxes -   - As a result of tax changes, prices should not move by 10 per cent. - To summarise, as I said before, the abolition of wholesale sales tax and its replacement with a 10 per cent GST, plus the abolition of embedded wholesale sales taxes and the abolition of indirect taxes which are all built into price, means that in relation to even those items which do not have a direct wholesales tax there will be tax savings as a result of embedded taxes. I also make the point that, if anybody believes that a price has been moved in a way which it should not, that matter can be reported to the ACCC, which has strong enforcement powers and which can investigate those particular matters to ensure that there is no price taking under the misleading or deceptive cover of a tax change. With the result of all of that, with the imposition of a 10 per cent GST we not only get a modern taxation system but also do away with the outdated wholesale sales taxes and the embedded taxes on inputs, something that could never be done under the current Australian taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes and acknowledge the great support he has provided to hostels in his electorate. The government believes in and actively supports education for all Australian children wherever they may live, in the city or in rural or remote Australia. School term hostels are a crucial resource for many rural and remote families. They choose to send their children to hostels so that they can satisfactorily complete their education. Last year, there were about 1,700 students in hostels around Australia. A number of these hostels in the last couple of years, mainly in New South Wales and Queensland, have faced closure because of the difficult times faced by many in rural and regional Australia. The Queensland and New South Wales Labor governments, confronted with this situation, slammed the door in the face of these hostels. They showed no concern whatever, these Labor Party governments, for reasonable access to education by children in remote Australia. These governments have an obligation to make sure that there is access for these children. They are in breach of their obligation. They manifestly failed these families. It was an unacceptable breach of their obligation. The Leader of the Opposition could do something - he could make representations - but he will do nothing because he always does nothing. His whole rhetoric in this area is empty hot air and has no substance whatever. - You could do something about this. You could make representations. But it was up to members of the coalition from rural and remote Australia, it was up to the Howard government, to take action to make sure that these hostels, at threat of closure, remained open. At the end of last year we had approved over half a million dollars to maintain open 18 hostels that would otherwise have closed because of the dereliction of the Labor Party governments. This draws the contrast between the attitude of the government and the attitude of the Labor Party. The government is concerned with educational opportunity for all young Australians. It is particularly concerned for those in rural and remote Australia. We acted. The Labor Party, state or federal, does nothing. </DOC>

 - To give the price effect on a Paddington Bear, first of all I would have to know the customs duty that had been paid on it, which would depend on whether or not a Labor Party person had brought it into the country. I can say that I have some familiarity with teddy bears and happen to know that teddy bears are taxed at 22 per cent at the moment. So I can get a nice cheap teddy bear to go with your nice pyjamas. You can curl up in bed and think of teddy. I am sure that will keep you happy and amused. In relation to Big W, I am informed by my office that the ACCC has been notified about this matter and has sent a letter asking Big W for an explanation. That shows that the ACCC is certainly swifter of foot than the Australian Labor Party. It is already onto the matter and I will not prejudice the outcomes until we actually know what that `Please explain' says. </DOC>

 - I have some great news for the honourable member. Health funds will be formally announcing their premium increases on 1 March, but I can inform honourable members that we expect the average premium increases across all funds this year to be 1.8 per cent. This is the lowest premium increase in at least a decade. It is in line with inflation which, for health care, is a very good effort, given that overseas - in the United States and the United Kingdom - premiums are going up in the order of 10 per cent a year. It has been a lot of hard work and compares to a figure of a 17 per cent increase in just one year under Labor in 1991-92. Of the 44 funds registered in Australia, we expect that eight of these funds will have no premium increase whatsoever. That means around 37 per cent of Australians will have no increase at all in their health fund premiums this year.The honourable member asked about other comments and expectations. I note that in January the shadow minister for health was going around saying that premiums would go up $140 per family. The fact is that, with this announcement, after the 30 per cent rebate, premiums will be going up in the order of $24 per year per family, less than 50c a week. The Labor Party's views have to be seen in the light of plain scaremongering, simply trying to scare people with false and misleading facts. If we take it in conjunction with the news yesterday that we have the best results in 17 years for private health insurance increased participation, the fact is our policies are working. We have turned the corner.  - The Labor Party clearly has no policy ideas whatsoever and has to resort to trying to scare Australians.</DOC>

 - There could have at least been a republican suite for me, Mr Speaker. In relation to the Accor group, of course the first thing that will be abolished, as I recall, is the hotel tax which the Labor Party put in in New South Wales. In relation to hotels, the accommodation tax will be coming off.  - It has always been the government's belief that there should be a goods and services tax on hotel accommodation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware that, when he makes his trips to Paris and London, he pays value added tax on his hotel rooms. I have no doubt that when he goes down to Bordeaux he pays value added tax on his hotel rooms. If Australians are paying value added tax when they go to hotels overseas, why shouldn't French and English tourists pay a goods and services tax when they come to Australia? Let me make this point: if tourists are coming to Australia, they should be making their contribution to the Australian taxation system, just like Australians make their contribution to taxation systems overseas. - I will finish off by saying, Mr Speaker, that it has always been a deliberate part of this government's policy that tourists into Australia will pay their fair share, just as Australians touring overseas pay their fair share. I believe that is fair and responsible. I also believe that it is long overdue. If there are countries all around the world that are applying value added taxes in that way, Australia ought not to be the one mug that leaves itself out of that system. Unfortunately, under Labor it would be. Under this government, we will have a modern taxation system and tourists into Australia will make their contributions, just as Australians make their contributions to overseas tax jurisdictions.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Curtin, whose electorate I visited just a few weeks ago, for the important question about share ownership levels in Australia. Australia is the greatest share owning nation in the world. As of today, 54 per cent of adult Australians now directly or indirectly own shares - that is, 7.6 million Australians - and 41 per cent of the adult population directly own shares. That is up from just 20 per cent in May 1997. Certainly, share ownership in Australia has surged under the Howard government. Much of the credit is due to the privatisation of Telstra. Telstra has 2.1 million shareholders and in Telstra tranche 2, overseen by the Minister for Finance and Administration, 321,000 people for the very first time became share owners. Mr Speaker, Australia passes the United States in share ownership levels to become number one on the list. The member for Werriwa, who has been good enough to join us in the House today, would have you believe, as he said in a speech in this House last year, that only the top end of town has shares. That is incorrect because 54 per cent of all Australian adults own shares, either directly or indirectly. The good news in this announcement is that, in households with an income of less than $30,000 a year, 22 per cent directly own shares. In households with incomes of between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, 39 per cent directly own shares. So it is not a privilege for the rich; it is particularly a privilege for working Australians. This is also reflected across regions. Forty-two per cent of adults in metropolitan Australia and 39 per cent in regional Australia own shares, which is up from 28 per cent in October 1998. That sort of increase in share ownership is directly attributable to the policies of the government. There is even better news on the horizon for all those share owners and even better news than that for those people who want to own shares but still do not own shares. Halving the capital gains tax, putting $12 billion of personal income tax cuts back into the Australian economy, putting more money into people's pockets and abolishing stamp duty on the transfer of shares - these are the incentives that will keep us as the greatest share owning nation in the world. </DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition persists in his campaign to do the workers of Rutherford in the eye. What this campaign by the Leader of the Opposition is opportunistically about is that he has demanded every to the point of going to Rutherford and demanding that I go into the cabinet dayand I inveigle the Deputy Prime Minister in the process to misrepresent me to the Australian peoplethat something be done immediately to help the workers of Rutherford. And, as soon as something is done, the Leader of the Opposition tries to have it undone. - The starting point of this whole debate is that our concern has been to protect the workers of Rutherford and nobody else. That is what the Labor Party asked before the event that we should do, and they now find it rather galling that we, having done that -   - we having been the first political party to offer an entitlement scheme for Australian workers -  - the Labor Party is now endeavouring to undo it. But let me return to this canard from the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party that, in some way, advocacy of the deed of arrangement was designed to protect the directors. Yesterday I quoted from an article in the Newcastle Herald, which appeared the day I met the workers at Williamtown in New South Wales, in which I pointed out that the administrator had advised the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that it would be better all around if a deed of arrangement were entered into. I subsequently found two or three more press reports quoting the administrator, one of them in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 29 January, a full 10 or 11 days before the cabinet met, quoting the administrator, John Starr, as saying:If receiver Prentice Parbury Barilla chose to liquidate the company's assets, workers would receive nothing.If he chose to liquidate the assets, the workers would receive nothing. - I will continue the quotation from the Sydney Daily Telegraph article. I will read the first bit again:The administrator said that if the receiver chose to liquidate the company's assets, workers would receive nothing.So the Leader the Opposition is advocating a course of action where these workers would receive nothing. - I continue the quotation from the Sydney Daily Telegraph:But if the receivers went ahead with a proposed sale of the company to Victorian based Bruck they would receive up to $7 million of their $11 million entitlement paid over two years.That was on 29 January. On the same day there appeared, in the Newcastle Herald, a further reference saying:Concerns have been raised that if National Textiles machinery valued at $9 million is auctioned in a liquidation fire sale it will fetch a fraction of its true price, delivering less to workers.In other words, I am being criticised by the Labor Party for following a course of action which would have robbed the workers of the amount that they are now getting. - The administrator has reported on his investigation of National Textiles and has concluded:There is at the end of the day, in my opinion, only one effective option and that is approval of the proposed deed of company arrangement. The administrator's report also said:On a liquidation basis it is estimated that there would only be $645,000 available for distribution to employees, excluding the liquidator's costs involved with any investigation ... In other words, we have it crystallised into a monetary comparison. Beazley stood to give the workers $600,000. I have guaranteed them $11 million. - The point is that the Leader of the Opposition bungled yesterday and it is a bit late to get back into the game. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been some comment today, particularly in the Sydney Morning Herald, about the issue of doctors in rural Australia. While that article is correct, people should not take that as being the case right around Australia. The issue of attracting doctors to rural Australia is one where federal and state governments interplay. The results around the country are patchy because different state governments approach it in different manners. When we look at the years 1997-98 - I have not yet seen the figures for 1999 - we find that, in rural Australia, the number of doctors providing a service under Medicare went up 5.3 per cent over those two years. That is a good result and certainly it turns around a 30-year decline. However, when we look at New South Wales we find that the number of doctors in that state went up only 1.9 per cent. New South Wales had the lowest increase of any state in Australia. Tasmania achieved a 20 per cent increase in the number of rural doctors; South Australia, 9.4; Queensland, 5.3; Western Australia, 4.8; Victoria, 4.6; and New South Wales, 1.9. Similarly, with remote area doctors, in that same period - 1997-98 - the number of doctors providing a service under Medicare went up nearly 20 per cent. In New South Wales it was 5.7 per cent only. Some governments, notably the Queensland government, have had great success. In 1998 the number of doctors in remote Queensland went up 20 per cent. This was due to the very commendable efforts of the former health minister, Mike Horan - efforts, to be fair, that have been continued since he showed the leadership to get doctors into rural Australia.On the federal government's part, the single most important thing we did was bring in the so-called provider number legislation which enabled temporary resident doctors, overseas trained doctors and recent graduates to get experience in rural Australia when they would not have been able to practise in urban centres. It also means that the doctor in rural Australia who comes here saying that they wish to practise in rural Australia has to actually keep that commitment. We did not have the capacity to do that previously. We now have state-based rural work force agencies in every state of Australia. Rural retention payments were introduced just before Christmas for the first time to reward doctors who were already in rural areas. This Christmas we will have 600 medical students around rural and remote Australia on John Flynn scholarships. We have a university Department of Rural Health starting at Wagga. This year the James Cook University at Townsville is starting a medical school. The member for Herbert can take a lot of credit for that. The Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme is providing scholarships to get more young country kids into medicine and in this respect the numbers of country kids in med school have been going up very substantially. There is no easy or quick solution here, and I do very much want to work with state governments. New South Wales does have a lot of room to catch up with the rest of Australia, and I look forward to working with the NSW health minister to try to fix that.</DOC>

 - The government has a program. You never had a program. It may surprise you that on this side we now have a minister responsible. You never had a minister responsible. - Mr Speaker, I am entitled to refer to `you' collectively. I am not referring to any particular individual. The facts are that the Labor Party had no minister responsible because they were never prepared to adopt a policy to actually look after workers. - Mr Speaker, on Saturday, as I advised earlier, the government placed advertisements in the press. As a result of that we have had something like 85 calls as at today. Of those 85 calls, quite a number have in fact come from your constituents, those who were formerly employed at Scone. Of course, some were employed and were terminated last year. As I understand it, in many of those situations they received 100 per cent of their entitlements, or some aspects of their entitlements. - No, in respect of Scone. - In respect of those who have made contact with my department, we have taken details from them. We are taking and obtaining further advice so that we can ascertain - This is a question about what we are doing with these workers. There is no way known this can be irrelevant. - I point out by way of aside that we have had 17 points of order today, and not one of them has been a fair point of order going to any issue under the standing orders. But in respect of these particular workers, we have made contact with them. We are now trying to ascertain the facts so that we can understand whether or not they are eligible. Furthermore, I can advise the House that I have written to my counterpart in New South Wales, Mr Geoff Shaw, the Minister for Industrial Relations. I have advised him of the approach that we will be taking, and I have asked him to advise me what approach the New South Wales government will be taking. This provides an opportunity for the Labor Party to do something to help these workers. The minister has before him a request from us to know what New South Wales is doing but I hear not one member of the Labor Party calling on the New South Wales government to stand up and participate in a scheme which will contribute to the welfare of these workers. It does not have a policy on these Scone workers any more than it has had a policy on any other workers in the last few years, let alone in its 13 years in government. The New South Wales Minister for Gaming and Racing has been prepared to take up this issue. My challenge to you blokes is to finally do something constructive on behalf of these workers. </DOC>

 - I spent some time last week with the honourable member for Groom in his electorate. Everywhere we went - indeed, everywhere you go in country Queensland - landholders are angry about the way in which the Beattie Labor government has trampled on their rights in forcing legislation through the Queensland parliament in the dying days before Christmas, introducing draconian new land clearing laws without any proper consultation with the rural sector. This is typical of Labor's approach to vital rural issues, trying to accentuate the divide between country and city, sitting in their city allotments, which are exempt from Labor's new land clearing laws, and passing judgment on the activities of farmers. Beattie's attempts to portray farmers as environmental vandals are utterly offensive and have certainly deeply affected rural and regional Australia, which was quite apparent in Winton over the weekend. The reality is that farmers are overwhelmingly conscious of their obligations to care for their land and they find the treatment by the Labor government in Queensland offensive. Also remarkable about the Labor government's decision, in a state that is always very keen to emphasise states' rights - and the state does have constitutional responsibility for land management issues  - is that the moment they stuff it all up and make a botch of their laws, they demand the Commonwealth pick up the bill. What has happened is that landholders, many of whom have been paying money to the state government for years to freehold their land, now have their rights restricted and the state government has no plans in place for compensation. Late one Saturday evening they faxed Senator Hill demanding that he produce $103 million in 48 hours - no justification; $103 million in 48 hours. I know Premier Beattie can find money to fund secret deals with Virgin Airlines and the like overnight, but this government has a responsible approach to financial management. There was no justification for the $103 million. Indeed, the state government shredded their own report, which put the cost of that compensation very much higher than they had previously admitted.  So the laws were rapidly pushed through parliament just in time for a big TV advertising campaign to commence on Brisbane television. So there was plenty of money for television advertising, and plenty of money for Virgin Airlines, but no money for compensation for the rights they were trampling on. It is clearly ridiculous that the Queensland government should expect the federal government to pick up the bill for their land clearing laws. They need to talk to the farm owners and the landholders in a responsible and genuine way. They need to get workable and reasonable laws. Once Mr Beattie has done those things, then he can start thinking about coming to Canberra to talk to us about what sort of an involvement we should have. His behaviour in this issue has been appalling. He has treated the landholders in Queensland with absolute contempt. It is time that he started taking responsibility for his own decisions. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I preface my specific answer with a general response which reminds the House of the undeniable fact that Labor did nothing about this problem for 13 years. The first point that has to be made is that we are the first government in the history of Federation to take seriously a proposition that workers retrenched without their entitlements get justice. We are the first government to do that. None of the bungling, incompetent bluster of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue can alter that undeniable fact. The second general proposition I would make in response to a general and a specific question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this whole matter is that at every stage we have acted in relation to National Textiles in a way that was designed to help the workers. At every stage - as I read the record of the numerous demands that have been made - we have in fact responded in full to what we were asked to do by the Australian Labor Party. I notice the amiable member for Hunter was on his feet a moment ago. Joel was out there demanding 100 per cent for the Rutherford workers a couple of weeks ago. - To conclude that general introductory response: at every point the government has in fact met the requests and the entreaties of the Labor Party to do what they never did when they were in government but to do what we have been prepared to do now that we are in government. It will ever be to the shame of the Australian Labor Party that they are now trying to undermine the deal that we did for the workers in Rutherford. Those workers will not forget the fact that the Labor Party has engaged in opportunistic hypocrisy on this issue. They demanded action; they screamed for action; they asked that we do what they failed to do in 13 years. We having now done it, they are in the process of dishonouring and undermining what we have done.  -  - If I had taken last week the advice that the Leader of the Opposition has tendered in the last 48 hours, those Rutherford workers would still be without their entitlements. - Mr Speaker, could I just observe that this question time has gone on longer than any question time since this government has been in office. There are two reasons for that.Opposition members - No answers! - One of the reasons for that is my determination to allow the full 20 questions today so that the opposition would have a complete opportunity to ask me anything they liked about the issue of National Textiles. The second reason has been the determined campaign of the Australian Labor Party through frivolous points of order. The Leader of the Opposition specifically asked about the elements of the government's approach. The minister announced last week- - As the House would be aware, last week the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business announced the details of the safety net scheme, which it had always been intended - and on this occasion I rely on the authority of the Leader of the Opposition amongst many others - would operate from 1 January. I understand from discussion with the minister that he has been in consultation already with the states. There are to be further discussions. It is contingent on state participation. It always has been my understanding that it was contingent on state participation.In relation to the top-up element, I indicated last week that the sorts of criteria that would be brought to bear there related to not only areas of particularly high unemployment but also industries that have been subjected to severe and continuous economic change. - I might say to those opposite who interject that, on both of those counts, the approach that this government has taken not only has been well in advance of what the Labor Party did but has shown a sensitivity to the working men and women of Australia that the Labor Party were monumentally unable to do. The situation is that the Labor Party continue to be embarrassed. It troubles me not that that embarrassment continues to 20 to four in the afternoon because on this occasion they have tried to undermine a decent attempt by this government to help working men and women in the regional areas of Australia. I am far from being embarrassed by it; I am proud of what my government has done for the working men and women of Australia. We have not only done, in a specific case, something that those opposite were unprepared to do. In the time that we have been in government, we have presided over a significant increase in real wages, we have seen a reduction of $266 a month in the mortgage payment of the average working family in this country, we have generated 600,000 new jobs and we have seen unemployment fall to its lowest level in 10 years. In other words, we complete a double of looking after the working men and women of Australia.I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby because he has pinpointed in that question the fundamental reality that the great beneficiaries of the goods and services tax, when it comes into operation on 1 July, will be the public providers of education, of health and of many other services provided by the state governments. What the opposition has to explain to state governments, and what the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have to explain to their own front bench, is that if the GST is, to use their beloved language, `rolled back', then there will be less money available for public education, there will less money available for public hospitals, and there will be less money available for police services. The reason Peter Beattie and Bob Carr signed up with alacrity - And David Crean. They went through this great charade. They said, `Prime Minister, this is an outrageous propositionbut, please, where do I sign?' Privately, the Queensland Premier has said to me on a number of occasions, `I acknowledge that Queensland is a great beneficiary of the goods and services tax.' But knowledge of how good the goods and services tax is for the states is not limited to the state premiers. It is now common knowledge on the front bench of the opposition. That is why the finance spokesman has warned against any rolling back of the GST. That is why the member for Dobell, who is trying to be an education spokesman, is saying, `Please, don't roll back the GST, because there will be less money available for government schools. There will be less money available for all of the education programs that I would like to propose.' Isn't it ironic that the man who would be the education minister of Australia wants to roll back funds for education? That is fundamentally what he wants, because it is not restricted. That old operative from Queensland, the shadow minister for family and community services, is alive to this, too. He has warned the Labor Party's frontbench that if it starts rolling back the GST there will be less money available for Labor's social programs. All of this provides bipartisan support, if I can put it that way, for a simple proposition - that the goods and services tax is the greatest boon for publicly provided education, health and police services that this country has ever seen. That is why the states have signed up to it. That is why it ought to have the support of every person in this country who believes in a decent level of public services. For years we have had the states saying to the Commonwealth - whether you had a Labor Prime Minister or a Liberal Prime Minister, whether your state premiers were on the conservative side of politics, such as Bjelke-Petersen and Court, or whether they were on the Labor side of politics, such as Burke, Beattie and others - 'What we need is a growth tax. We need to have a tax that rises over time so that we can provide adequate and increased levels of services.'For the first time since the end of World War II we are going to provide that via the goods and services tax. When the goods and services tax comes in, you will have an unprecedented level of growing financial support for those basic services. Any suggestion that you roll that back is a threat to the funding of government schools. It is a threat to the funding of public hospitals. It is a threat to the funding of adequate police services. That is why Lindsay Tanner, Wayne Swan and Michael Lee are sounding the warning bells. While their deputy leader and leader are talking about rolling it back or walking it back or strolling it back or running it back, they are saying, `Please, just leave it where it is. Let them carry the responsibility of putting it in. Let them carry the leadership role of reforming our tax system. Let us hope and pray that we can ride in on the back of it. But, for heaven's sake, don't touch it once we are there, because it is an absolute bonanza for the publicly provided services of the nation.' That has to take the cake for political hypocrisy!</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, that little - what should I call it? - question or outburst or explosion might have had a scintilla of credibility if the person who was responsible for the outburst had not unfortunately predicted on 16 June 1999, when being interviewed by Geoff Parry, that in fact the GST was not going to raise as much revenue as we were suggesting. You cannot have it both ways. In that question you cannot run around and say that it is not, and then start suggesting that it will not raise as much revenue. What he was alleging when he was interviewed by Geoff Parry was that we would be suggesting that the states could keep the indirect taxes that are going to be abolished with the proceeds of the GST. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot allege in June 1999 that it is not going to raise as much money as you have predicted and then allege in February of the year 2000 that it is going to raise so much more money that we are going to use that as an excuse to cut back funding in other areas.We have an intergovernmental agreement in relation to specific purpose payments. This is something the Leader of the Opposition cannot escape from, and his frontbench know it. His frontbench are already unnerved by this campaign being run by him and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They are going around to every interest group that has got a complaint and saying, `If you vote for us, we will roll the tax back.' Every time they ask a question in this House on behalf of an interest group, they are really saying in code to that interest group, `If you vote Labor, we will take the tax off the thing that you have complained about.' In the end there is some accountability on taxation reform. We have been honest enough to say to the Australian people that this country needs taxation reform. We have fought an election on taxation reform and this taxation reform is going to give to the states of Australia the highest level for increasing provision for education, health and police that this country has ever seen. Every time the Leader of the Opposition talks about rolling something back or exempting something, what he is really doing is blowing a hole in funding for government schools, for government hospitals, for police services and all the other services that have to be provided by the states. The good news for those states is that Lindsay Tanner, Michael Lee, Wayne Swanthe virtuous trio on this issueand all the other people have blown the whistle on this attempt by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to blow away the greatest thing that any federal government has done for the finances of the Australian states since the end of World War II. We intend to remind the Australian people and the states of this great deal in the months that lie ahead in this very interesting debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. I note, as she said in her question, that revenue from the goods and services tax goes to state governments to fund essential services. We had one of the usual stunts from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday when he came in with pyjamas and complained that there was a 10 per cent GST on them. As he came to the dispatch box all he had to say was one simple thing: `The Labor Party policy is to abolish 10 per cent GST on pyjamas.' That is all he had to say. That is all he had to do. If he was complaining about 10 per cent GST on pyjamas, he could have walked to the dispatch box and given an undertaking to repeal it. And then, to tempt fate, he went on Channel 9 this morning and was asked this question: `If the GST is going to be so damaging to Australian consumers, why not commit the Labor Party now to dumping it?' It was not a bad question. And his answer was: `Look, because we've said ... um ... once it's in ... um ... you can't unscramble the eggs.'  -   - Oh, you poor old thing! It would be the simplest law imaginable to say, `GST is repealed and wholesale sales tax is imposed.' It is the simplest law possible. Here we have a copy of the Labor Party tax policy. All we need is for you to pull out your pen and say, `If I am ever Prime Minister I will repeal GST.' All you have to do is write the first principle on your tax policy: if I am ever Prime Minister, I will repeal GST. That is all he has to do. Pick up the biro - no, not the glass. Pick up the biro. `If I am ever Prime Minister, I will repeal GST' - the first proposition of the Labor Party tax policy. I can see the Daily Telegraph headline tomorrow, `Labor's tax policy', and a blank front page. If it is so damaging, why not commit the Labor Party to dumping it? That was not a bad question that you were asked on Channel 9 this morning. -  - Oh, hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. Steve Bracks, on 3AW on 25 January 2000, said this:We had a system where there could have been a great tax if there was a GST on all products. Now it is not. It is questionable whether the states will ever get a growth out of this.Steve Bracks is complaining that there are now exemptions in the GST. Poor old Steve. I got a letter from David Hamill, MLA, Labor Treasurer of Queensland. He wrote that he has received representations for certain dermatological medicines to be declared GST free. This is what the Labor Treasurer of Queensland wrote to me on 18 January 2000:As you are aware, broadening the existing list of GST-free items has the potential to adversely impact on the quantum of GST revenues that are available for distribution to the Commonwealth and state governments for the delivery of core services. Changes to the GST-free list for these products may set a precedent for other parties to seek relief.Hamill has written to me saying, `Whatever you do, don't make anything GST free. We won't be able to deliver core services.' On the radio, Bracks said, `Oh, we have now got exemptions. We are not getting enough revenue.' The Labor Treasurer of Tasmania, David Crean, has written to me saying, `We need the GST to recover our state position.' Bob Carr is promising $20 million of infrastructure out of GST revenues and the hypocrites of the Labor frontbench are going around saying, `We are opposed to GST.' Well, pull out the pen, put it in writing, let the Australian people know it, and cease this hypocrisy.</DOC>

 - I have never seen you so agitated. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks A Month in the Country is the Bordeaux winegrowing regions.  -   - The tinted windows in the back of the Roller - that is what he thinks. I will look at that Roller when I next see it and see if it did have tinted windows. If there are any complaints that organisations or individuals are using tax changes to promote price increases, they can be notified to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I note, in passing, that a complaint had been put in about Big W on the price exploitation line. The ACCC commenced questions on 11 January and, according to its release, on 2 February it put to Big W that it should withdraw those price tickets. Big W announced last night that it was withdrawing them. This is a classic example of how the government's mechanisms work. If there are further complaints, I would recommend to people that they do the same thing and contact the price exploitation line.</DOC>

 - Yesterday, I was asked a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who said:In reference to his promise that nothing will rise by the full 10 per cent under the GST, is he aware that the Accor hotel group have announced that they will be increasing all of their room charges by the full 10 per cent ...I should have taken the Prime Minister's advice when he said that one should never rely on anything that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, because that statement made to the House yesterday was utterly false. This afternoon, Accor Pacific has issued a press release which is headed:Accor not to increase room charges by 10 per cent.It reads:Australia's largest hotel group Accor will not be raising room rates by the full 10 per cent of the GST. Analysis by the company has highlighted that some cost reduction will be able to be passed on to guests following the 1 July 2000 imposition of the GST. The Chairman said limited savings can be passed on in relation to accommodation charges. More substantial savings should be possible in the food and beverage area.This release was put out today because the allegation was made in the House yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionfalsely, as he always does. It prompted an ACCC inquiry, and the media release was put out in response to that ACCC inquiry. The release finishes up by saying:Mr Baffsky said that, in the whole context of the issue, it is important to make valid comparisons between similar products. `It is not helpful to muddy the waters with ill-informed assertions.'I wonder whom he could have been referring to when he said, `making ill-informed assertions'? This is the old technique. Every day you come in here, you make a false accusation and you get the media to run it. By the time somebody responds to it, you have made another one so that you have the media onto the false allegation of the day. If this were being done for some coherent purpose, we could understand it, but do you know what it is being done for? It is being done by a group of people who are so hotly opposed to the GST that, if they ever get elected, they are going to keep it. That is their position. This is nothing but an attempt to try to poison public debate. They have no policy. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to start writing one, the page stands blank before him. `Point 1: Labor tax policy: I irrevocably commit myself to abolishing GST.' That is all you have to do - pull out your 22 per cent wholesale sales tax biro and write it.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to take that question. I would be very interested to read the book by Peter Bowers, who I understand is an ex-journalist. I would also be very interested to know how Mr Bowers priced it - whether he claims that the price rise is solely due to tax changes or whether he claims that the price rise is for some other reason - for example, his wanting to make more money. - I would have thought one of the most obvious things -  -  - Mr Speaker, I would be very happy to look at it. Obviously it has already been published, and GST does not apply. I would have thought that would be a bit of a problem for your argument, because the GST applies on 1 July 2000. - Mr Speaker, if there are legitimate complaints in relation to that, we will refer them to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so that it can be looked at. Price is determined, as I have said on a number of occasions, by a whole host of factors. Price is determined not just by cost to production. Price is determined by market conditions, price is determined by retail margins and price is determined by other competing products. As we have always made entirely clear, price and tax are two different things.If somebody tries to pass off a price change as being solely and exclusively the result of a tax change and that constitutes price exploitation within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is entitled to investigate that. If that amounts to price exploitation, it has at its disposal fines of very large sums of money which it can obviously impose on those people who have engaged in either price exploitation or misleading and deceptive conduct.</DOC>

 - I have received the first report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to the government on the GST and ANTS implementation process and I am releasing it today. It deals with a number of issues. The first and most significant issue is in relation to the first tranche of tax cuts associated with the ANTS package. Last July the government reduced wholesale sales tax on a range of goods from 32 per cent to 22 per cent in the lead-up to the new taxation system. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission reports that the flow-through of price cuts for consumers was higher than expected. The ACCC expected price cuts of between five and seven per cent. In fact, business has delivered price cuts in excess of seven per cent to consumers. These are facts, not speculation. Most businesses surveyed - in fact, 99 per cent - passed on the wholesale sales tax cuts. So, under our tax system, TVs, video players, CD players, sound systems, video cameras, watches, clocks, clock radios and cameras - to name a few - are already in excess of seven per cent cheaper. That is in addition to the $12 billion of personal income tax cuts that are to come in on 1 July. The key reason for these larger than expected price cuts is competition in the marketplace. If a shop down the road is passing on the full tax cut to consumers, then your business will suffer if you do not pass on those tax cuts. The good work of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission continues in a number of areas. It will continue with its monitoring of over three million prices across Australia. In its report it reveals that it has handled over 2½ thousand complaints via its GST hotline and has investigated 175 of the substantive issues. The ACCC has a number of court enforceable undertakings. Moreover, one businessman has already gone to jail. Competition and the work of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission are ensuring that consumers are the full beneficiaries - in fact, more than full beneficiaries - of the tax cuts. More is to come, and this augurs well for 1 July.</DOC>

 - We take action whenever we are notified of matters, and we have a price hotline which consumers can ring. It is the first time, of course, that there has ever been one. When the Labor Party increased wholesale sales taxes from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, 20 per cent to 22 per cent and 30 per cent to 32 per cent, there was never any price exploitation guideline, there was never any ACCC monitoring, there was never any compensation for pensioners, there was never any income tax cut and there was never any increase in family allowances. In relation to books generally, the government has announced not only the abolition of the wholesale sales tax - which applies, of course, to printing - but also a book printing scheme.  - It was not a book bounty at all. If he had let me finish the sentence, he would find it was a scheme that was put in place for Australian books to actually subsidise the price of Australian books. That is what I was going to say. That was part of the agreement that the government had entered into with the Australian Democrats and which we have put in place. As I said before, the government has precise guidelines. They have never been put in place before, never were put in place under a Labor government and never applied to any tax increase in relation to a Labor government. We have a very active, independent commissioner, Professor Fels, we have an exploitation line and we have $10 million enforcement powers. If there is a belief that anybody is trying to use tax changes to get a price increase and passing off a price increase on the grounds that it is a tax change when it is not, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has full powers to investigate and fine those engaged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. To the interjection: the government's proposal is, and we are acting on this basis, that the scheme starts from 1 January. We are proceeding with this on an administrative basis. We have taken something like 85 calls up to yesterday, there were more calls again today from employees and we are going about the business of ascertaining the facts in respect of each and every one of those employees, not just Scone Fresh Meats but also other businesses and so we are proceeding accordingly.Opposition Member - You said Scon this morning. - And I corrected myself to say Scone. In respect of support, I can advise the House that we have had a letter from the Minister for Gaming and Racing in New South Wales, dated 2 February, on behalf of those workers. He said that these workers and their families need urgent assistance and support. He went on to say that they ought to be included in any package offered to retrench workers. Of course, subject to ascertaining their personal details, which we are starting on the job of doing so, then they are certainly eligible in that sense.I am also pleased to advise the House that I have had some unexpected support for the 1 January start-up date, and that is a letter from the federal member for Hunter dated 8 February. It took a little while to work its way through the system and to hit my desk, but it was pleasing to have support from the Labor Party for 1 January, seeing that the rest of the hypocrites on the other side have been attacking the 1 January date as inappropriate. He has written to me including a letter from the Cessnock City Council regarding the protection of employee entitlements. He supports the city council and the city council wants a date, wants 1 January, so there is a bit more support there.In terms of the circumstances at National Textiles, I should note that in the press today we have the administrator there making a simple point that AWM currently employs approximately 250 persons - that is a business down in the seat of Braddon - and that if the deeds are not approved and the cash injection is not received then its business is in jeopardy and this could put at risk the employees' jobs and ongoing trading. This is in his report. So, as the week draws to an end, the fact is that this is the first government to actually do something for these workers and actually put a scheme in place to give these workers some genuine reassurance about their prospects as a result of losing a job and losing the entitlements that go with it. As the week draws to an end, the reality of Labor's true position on this whole issue is now starting to become clear for everybody. As we were saying at the start of this week, the Labor Party's only interest in this whole issue was just an opportunistic, populist approach simply because they could score a few points out of it - absolutely irrelevant to the interests of the workers. The proof I have of that is a radio interview this morning by none other than one of the most senior Labor Party people in Australia today, namely, the Premier of New South Wales. He was asked about the circumstances facing these particular meat workers. One of the things he said was that, in respect of National Textiles, they put money in there - and you will remember that we put money in but so did New South Wales; in fact, they were out there arguing it should be fifty-fifty - and they were prepared to do the right thing and so should  the federal government.  - Well, let me just get the facts straight hereI will say more about what Mr Carr had to say. He was also misleading people because he said, `We were prepared to put money in on the expectation the federal government was about to introduce a national scheme.' Well, I have a letter from Jeff Shaw, which I would be happy to make available to anybody who asks, that makes the point that it was a one-off package without prejudice to negotiations on a comprehensive national scheme, so he has misled people.But, incredibly, this story of Bob Carr is the same story you would get if Kim Beazley were running this country. That is, when it finally comes to the crunch, he was asked the question, `Will the Labor Party in New South Wales help these workers?' and what was the answer? `No, we will not be.' In other words, for those particular workers the New South Wales Labor Party is not prepared to lift a finger and support a basic scheme to protect those people's employee entitlements. This is the Labor Party, populist and opportunistic, but when it comes to the real job of actually providing assistance they are not prepared to lift a finger. They offered a lot of advice to us - the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hunter and all the others on the other side - about what we ought to do in the last case. Let us see if they have got what it takes to take on the New South Wales government and force them, embarrass them, into doing the right thing by workers.</DOC>

 - Let me make some initial comments, and I think the PM may supplement them. I have not seen those particular remarks of Mr Carr's, but the fact of the matter is that, as the cabinet sat down to make this decision, the advice we had from the administrator was that, if there was a liquidation, there would be $600,000 and, if the deed of arrangement was proceeded with, there would be $7 million. You do not need to be an accountant to work out that, if there is $7 million in the kitty, that is a much stronger position for the employees. The total amount outstanding was $11 million. There was $7 million coming in under that scheme, leaving a balance of $4 million, and we were prepared to put up a net amount of $4 million. In fact, we were prepared to put up on a fifty-fifty basis. With New South Wales, we are prepared to put in more than that so that, up-front, the workers would get their entitlements and then, as the funds came back in, there would be a reimbursement to the scheme to make sure that not only were they provided with their entitlements but they had some money up-front and the security that went with that. - The only other advice I can give the House on the matter specifically is that this week I received a letter from Mr Carr seeking further details on the actuality of the arrangements. As I understand it, my department and his department have been having some discussions. The truth of the matter is that, as displayed by Mr Carr's comments, he was prepared to put his hand in his pocket and do the right thing when he thought there was a vote in it, but when it comes to the Scone workers he walks away from them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Members of the House might like to know that I have actually been prompted to think a little about this question as a result of a press release put out by the member for Batman headed `Labor will give regional and rural communities their voice back'. It proclaims that this will be done through a `strong commitment to Australia Post and Telstra'. I thought this was interesting and that we had actually done a pretty strong job here and had some pretty good things to talk about. So I went and had a bit of a look, and I found that in relation to postal services we have given, for a start, a commitment that no post office or mail centre will close in regional Australia. We have introduced a service charter for Australia Post that requires a minimum retail presence of 4,000 postal outlets, of which 2,500 must be in rural and regional Australia. We are continuing vital subsidies to 700 licensed post offices in rural and regional Australia. We are working with Australia Post to deliver new and innovative services, like the pilot program that Senator Alston and I recently launched to provide Commonwealth Bank business services through Australia Post's electronic network. More than that, in the time that we have been in government we have opened 51 new post offices around Australia. I thought that was a pretty good record. Then I went and had a look at what happened to post offices when those opposite were in power, and I found that, whilst we have opened 51 new post offices and we have a solid commitment that none will be closed, while they were in government 270 Australian post offices closed. That is their commitment: to give a voice back through their commitment to Australia Post and Telstra. And between the years 1990-91 and 1995-96 alone we lost 195. Then there is their commitment to telecommunications. The record shows that Labor took the same wrecking ball approach to this area. If it wasn't for the coalition, tens of thousands of rural and regional Australians would have lost their mobile phone service as well. Their spokesman over there conceded that they had signed a contract to phase out analog phone services. The fact is that, whilst we have provided an alternative with the CDMA now being wound out as a replacement, they were going to leave tens of thousands of people not only without a capacity to post a letter, which they had done when they were in government, but also without the ability to use a mobile phone service. The fact is that, when it comes to services from Telstra and when it comes to services from Australia Post, they are the ones who took away rural voices. We are the people who are putting them back in spadefuls. </DOC>

 - I have made it entirely clear on behalf of the government that the government will be implementing its election commitment in full.  - The government will be doing that in such a way that we equalise back the price by reducing excise. If you happen to be in business, because you get GST back, the cost of petrol will fall by 10 per cent. If you happen to be in places like Warburton in Western Australia, the diesel fuel which brings everything in and brings everything out, which under the Labor Party has excise of 44c a litre -  - will fall to 20c a litre. So the great thing for the people of Warburton is that there will be a 24c a litre fall in diesel excise between the coalition and the Labor Party for everything that goes in and everything that comes out.</DOC>

 - The ACCC have substantial resources to be able to appropriately monitor prices right across Australia, and they are doing that through a range of measures, including contracting out to price monitors, which includes a large number of people moving around to a large number of places and accumulating over three million prices during the price monitoring phase. - The question that should be asked is: what has the Labor Party ever done about price monitoring? What did the Labor Party do to monitor the price impact on consumers when it introduced its l-a-w wholesale sales tax increases? What did the Labor Party do to monitor the impact on consumers when it put up petrol prices? The Labor Party has always treated consumers with contempt and it is high hypocrisy for the Labor Party to start asking questions about price monitoring.</DOC>

 - Australian taxpayers and parents spend about $14 billion a year on schooling. - And, of course, more money will be available, as the Prime Minister points out, under the GST revenue to the states. Taxpayers and parents are entitled to know about the performance of these schools in terms of how effectively young people are being taught the basic literacy and numeracy skills that they need for life. The veil of secrecy which has shrouded the literacy performance of schools is about to be lifted. Let us make no mistake: this veil of secrecy has been in place because of the Labor Party's alliance with the Australian Education Union to suppress the release of information about the literacy performance of Australian schools. This was a problem that the Leader of the Opposition did nothing about when he was in office. He was weak. He caved in to the unions and had no plans whatever to tell Australian parents what they wanted to know. He sat on data and information that would have told them and he made sure that that information was never published. The Howard government has put in place an agreement with the states and territories to make sure that parents will get this information. Last year, children in every state and territory were assessed against the national literacy standards for reading, writing and spelling. The results of these standards will be available in the next few weeks. The first state to make its results public is South Australia. South Australia has reported that 83 per cent of its year 3 students were at the national standard for reading. That means that 17 per cent of the students in South Australia at year 3 were below the national standard for reading. I want to congratulate the South Australian minister, Malcolm Buckby, for releasing these results, for highlighting the extent of the issue - which Labor set out to conceal throughout its entire 13 years in office - for putting an honest statement on the public record and for addressing the issue. I am also advised that, in addition to South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have already forwarded their results for incorporation into the national report on schooling. The remaining states - Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland - are due to forward in the next few days their results for national reporting. I am pleased that the Premier of Victoria has stated that Victoria will release its results. So, within a very short time, the Australian community will have available to it, for the first time in 20 years, an accurate assessment of the literacy standards and performance of Australian schools. It has taken the Howard government's leadership in education to make this information available to taxpayers, parents and the community. The Labor Party did nothing when it was in office. It has no plan to do anything now. Its election policy at the last election promised nothing in relation to the publication of literacy results. This government is fulfilling its commitment to Australian parents.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I would perhaps rhetorically ask: have you instructed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stop promising to roll back the GST when you know that that will do such enormous damage to government schools and to government hospitals? As far as my communications with ministers are concerned, they are friendly, open, always informative and always valuable in the public interest. I do not instruct ministers; I provide them with advice. Being commonsense men and women, they respond to that advice in a very intelligent fashion.The last time we had a frontbench meeting about the GST, we did not argue, the way they did over there, about whether it should be rolled back. The last time we had a meeting about taxation reform, we all agreed on a number of things. The first thing we agreed on was that we were not going to allow a dishonest fear campaign by the Australian Labor Party to deny the Australian people the greatest tax reform since World War II. The second thing we agreed on was to remind the Australian people that, come the introduction of tax reform, average families would be $47 a week better off. We also resolved to remind the Australian people - the state premiers do not need any reminding of this - that the GST will mean a guarantee of rising revenues for the states in the years ahead and therefore more money for schools, more money for hospitals and more money for police.  That is why David Hamill is petrified at the prospect of the GST being rolled back. What David Hamill was really saying in that letter was that the Labor Party should have supported the original package without exception. What he was really saying was that it was a great pity that the government had to compromise with the Democrats. There is one party that could have saved that compromise, Mr Speaker, and oddly enough it is the party of David Hamill. - Mr Speaker, when we last discussed this matter we resolved to communicate those benefits to the Australian people. One of those is the evident benefit to the states of Australia of the GST. Whatever you may think about other aspects of it - and there will be debate - it is simply absolutely uncontestable that the states will be better off under the GST. Therefore, there will be more money for public schools, more money for police, more money for roads and more money for public hospitals. The premiers know that, the state treasurers know it, and Wayne Swan, Lindsay Tanner and Michael Lee know it. That is why they are growing increasingly unhappy with the idea of rolling it back, because if you roll it back you are taking money back from the states and you are taking it away from government schools. I was out at a magnificent government school in Chapman this morning. I would not have thought that the Labor Party wanted to take money away from government schools, but that is essentially what they are on about. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The history of the Riverside Nursing Home does it no credit at all. It has form back to 1988. -  - I ascertained that during 13 years of Labor government you only closed one home in those 13 years. When the new legislation came into effect, those homes which under the old system were designated as `homes of concern', which included Riverside, were referred to the agency. The agency worked with that home to bring it up to standard -  -  - which it did. On 16 January of this year, an incident occurred that is, quite frankly, beyond belief in this day and age. Members will recall that I came into this House in the last week of sitting and said what I had found out on the evening of 15 February and what action I had taken and put in place on the morning of 16 February, having worked through the night to achieve that end.The fact of the matter is that for a registered nurse in this day and age to order that elderly patients, some with open wounds merely taped up and others with catheters, be placed in a bath containing kerosene is unbelievable. - The action taken by the department was that it received a complaint on the next day, the 17th. It appears from the record that it received that complaint at first instance from the infectious diseases department of the Victorian government. The Victorian government have a responsibility to do with infectious diseases and responsibility under their own act. However, on 17 February, the department contacted the approved provider, and the approved provider was asked to rectify the situation. At that point, if this was not done, it should have been referred to the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency for inspection and investigation. A decision was made by the department not to do this. The system was in place but the process was not followed.It then came to my attention, at 10 p.m. on 15 February, that this incident had taken place. The matter was referred to the agency by the department at 1 o'clock in the morning and by 9 o'clock there was an inspection team of three nurses, an assessor from the agency and a departmental official who conducted a thorough two-day review. It is the department which makes the decisions about this matter. It is the secretary who has the authority under the act, and the delegate of the secretary makes the decision. As a result of the report written by the inspection team, the decision was made that sanctions should be put in place and that the provider status should be revoked, which meant that all federal funding would cease. The delegate recommended that this action be suspended, conditional upon an administrator being appointed and certain health standards and things about the building being brought up to standard. We then had agency and departmental nurses in that facility every day, at random times, looking after the safety of the residents.  We then had the situation where we received a report from those nurses, who said that nothing was being done to bring anything up to scratch. Accordingly, the department asked the agency to do another full audit review and report to the department. Under the act the provider had an entitlement to 14 days in which to respond. That 14 days would have been up tomorrow. As a result of the second review, the delegate made a decision that sanctions should be imposed - this means that federal funding of the value of $1.96 million per year is totally withdrawn - and that the licences, which on the open market if they were sold would be worth around $2 million, should also be revoked. The contingency plans worked out were these. Under the act, once the determination is made and the process is served - and I was advised that that occurred at about 8 o'clock this morning - plans have to be in place for the residents to be evacuated. We had an arrangement with the Victorian government to use their ambulances. They were indeed able to supply those ambulances.Before the action was taken, a communication and a residents kit went from the department to each resident and to the loved ones -  - Mr Speaker, this is not an amusing matter. This is a very serious matter -  - It is being treated very seriously. The fact of the matter is that my concern all along has been for the residents. By remaining in that home, their lives are at risk. There was an incident last week of a lady who had a broken arm. She described a pain on 19 February. It was not discovered or sent for an X-ray until 26 February. When she came back from the hospital - this is despite the fact that doctors were called - she was put in a position where her life could be at risk because she was not properly put into her bed. In other words, the evidence that was found by the nurses that went in was sufficiently of concern for the most serious of all sanctions to be taken.This does mean, as I said, that licences have been revoked. It does mean that recurrent funding is withdrawn. I would like to express my thanks to the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent's for working with the department so well and for providing what is a lovely facility - indeed, residents and their relatives are presently being taken on an inspection tour. Residents may then be brought back so that their fears may be dealt with. Under the act there is no provision for notice, and that I believe is something that needs to be remedied because the speed of the action does indeed make things difficult for people when they are told they have to move. The problem of the Victorian government trying to make a political headline on Saturday morning was quite unconscionable. - It meant that there were fears that started for the residents -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This matter is one where older, frail Australians have firstly been bathed in kerosene and subsequently have had blisters occur. We have had situations where the building itself is deficient, where there is evidence that bandages that have been used to dress wounds have been washed and reused, where a dressing on a wound that has seeped has been simply taped up and no new dressing applied. Indeed, our department officials went out and spent $400 in order to make these resources available, and this is despite the funding that has been made available to this person. It is no longer acceptable for that money to be paid to that provider. Again I go back to the residents and their need for care and safety. They are not safe in the Riverside home. They will be safe with the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent's.  Indeed, the action that we have taken has been speedy; it has been accurate. We have been at great pains not to make any statements that would pre-empt the action that the delegate might take which would impugn any of the legality of the action taken. Mr Speaker, I can say to you that I do hope that those in the opposition who think this is an opportunity for political activity will instead see that this reform act is the one that was greatly needed, that the history of this home alone - going back to 1988 - means that the reforms were needed. And indeed, since this act has been in place, we have raised standards enormously.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. He may have been as intrigued as the rest of Australia with a recently announced policy from the Labor Party. They are rare but they come along every now and then. After conducting this apparently ferocious campaign against the goods and services tax, it now appears that the policy of the Labor Party is that, if they are ever elected, they are so opposed to it that they intend to keep it. What is more, they intend to add additional layers of complexity by so-called `rolling it back'. If you roll back goods and services tax and you guarantee revenue to the states, as the Leader of the Opposition has, the first consequence of that would be that the only way you can make up the difference is through new taxes to raise new revenue. There have now been 30 occasions on which the Leader of the Opposition has been given the opportunity to rule out a policy of increasing income taxes, and on each and every single one of those 30 occasions he has taken the opportunity to keep open the prospect of Labor's increasing income taxes. What a policy we now have from the Labor Party! They want to keep GST and they want to roll up income taxes as well; roll back GST, roll out the barrel on the spending, roll over on union claims - rolled gold disaster from the Leader of the Opposition. When you actually ask him to outline where he intends to roll back GST - something he has been thinking about for the last four years - as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 1 December 1999, he says this:The Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, conceded yesterday that promising to roll back the GST, the Labor Party was travelling an uncharted road with an unknown destination.An `uncharted road with an unknown destination'. He cannot tell you where, he cannot tell you when and he cannot tell you how he is going to get the income but he is in favour of a policy of roll-back. The Financial Review of 23 February 2000 reported that Labor Party frontbenchers:...pushing to hold off on releasing details of the GST policy fear that revealing early concessions would lead to a bidding war, with demands to exempt more and more politically sensitive items.'Where do you draw the line - children's clothes, pensioners' electricity bills?' asked one frontbencher.So they are now confronting the problem of rolling back with no charting of the road and no end in sight - just a promise out there and one commitment to make up any revenue that is lost. We might well ask the question: how are you going to know the revenue that is lost without asking those industries which you have exempted to file GST returns anyway to tell you what they would have paid had they been in the system?I think this is obviously starting to worry the faithful, as Malcolm Farr reported on the Labor Party chat room. A Mr Leonard McCarthy wrote in to say this: `Initial reaction will be to call me mad, but I prefer shadow foreign affairs minister Laurie Brereton as leader.' The next morning, Simon O'Toole agreed. He said, `I must be mad too, Len, because I have always thought Laurie Brereton would not be that bad, particularly in the lack of talent environment the federal parliamentary Labor Party finds itself in.'This is a policy of roll-back on an uncharted road with no destination, no means of funding it and no serious thought. This is an opposition that will say or do anything because it wants this government to do the hard work and it wants to try to slide in on all of the hard work that we have done. This is an opposition that has no policy and no leadership. </DOC>

 - The period that I said that the elderly are at risk is right now. That is why the delegate said that this action should be taken. The fact of the matter is that the accreditation system - the first time it has been introduced - is designed to exclude from the system those providers who ought not to be in it. In other words, the standards that were tolerated before will not be under this system. The answer to the question of the honourable member is that there were contact visits between the agency and the facility. As I explained to you, it was one that was handed over from the list of homes of concern under the previous act. The agency then worked with the people on that list to bring them up to standard. And there are some very good news stories about it where, indeed, people have been brought up -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact of the matter is that the accreditation scheme has as its aim bringing substandard homes up to standard so that people are properly cared for. The method of doing this is by references to the agency from the department via complaints, by self-reference by the agency or by, initially, reference of homes of concern to the agency for their investigation. - They work continually, with contact visits. In the course of that the agency has carried out 1,250 visits to facilities and 825 support visits, and this is in addition to the system of inspection that goes on pursuant to the resident classification scale, where some 14,000 checks of individual residences have been made, with 1,500 visits. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point that I am making here is that the whole system is designed to bring poor standard residential aged care up to standard. I would have hoped that members of the opposition, who would have homes in their electorates where they would want the best care to be given, would be interested in knowing how the reforms are working. With the aim of achieving this outcome, I can only say to you that, where this sort of incident occurred, I do not think I ever again will hear of a registered nurse ordering elderly Australians to be placed in a bath of kerosene. I do not think I will hear of it ever again. I think the fact that the subsequent report has shown that this action was required shows how much the reforms were needed and how well they are now being implemented. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest in this issue. I am aware of comments. They started two weeks ago when a number of newspapers reported a senior opposition figure as saying that the opposition was seriously considering scrapping the rebate. I can inform the House that that opposition figure was the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for health, who was actively and openly briefing journalists that the opposition was thinking of scrapping the 30 per cent rebate. Her foray into policy lasted 24 hours, when the opposition leader went on ABC radio and was asked by John Fayne, `So will you scrap it?' The reply was, `But it's impossible to scrap.' A very reluctant turnaround!The opposition continue with their difficult position on this, with the member for Fremantle, immediately after the Leader of the Opposition said they were not going to scrap it, being quoted in the paper as saying, `The policy has to be questioned.' The fact is that this was put into some perspective by the Leader of the Opposition in the interview with John Fayne, when he said, `You've got thousands of people out there who are elderly, who if you suddenly rip the rug out from under them, you would find them in a situation where they couldn't afford private health insurance.' I think it is illustrative to tell the House how we got into the position we were in with private health insurance in the first place. We got into that position after 13 years of abject neglect and failure by the Labor Party. We got into that position because of the abolition of the Commonwealth bed day subsidy, because of the abolition of the Commonwealth's contribution to the reinsurance pool and because of the reduction of Medicare rebates to in-patients in private hospitals. We got into a situation where premiums went up by 17 per cent in one year - in 1991-92 - so much so that, in the first full financial year of this government, private health insurance funds lost $131 million.We have had a startling turnaround in the last three years. We have had the best results in terms of increased members - nearly 294,000, but over a million if you look at the long-term trend of decline. Premium increases are at the lowest for 10 years. We have made health insurance far more affordable, the gap is being addressed, funds are now back into profitability and prudential arrangements are appropriate for the industry. The only threat to the private health insurance industry is the Leader of the Opposition, who has not ruled out reducing the rebate from 30 per cent to something less, and who has not ruled out a means test on the rebate, which means people would go in and out of it over the period of their lives. The industry has been turned around after 15 years of decline, and the Labor Party has no clue what they will do to address their abject neglect and failure. </DOC>

 - I will explain it for you again. Very simply, the aim of the accreditation system is to raise the standards of all homes to a standard where individual Australians are receiving only good care. To do that, it is necessary to use the agency to have support visits in order that they may determine whether or not improvement is being made. Spot checks are a method that may be used - and it was used on the morning of 16 February - when there is a need for it to be used, and indeed it was used. The answer is that, just as there had been complaints with this home in 1992 and 1993 under ministers such as Peter Staples, Mr Howe and Carmen Lawrence, under our system we have a targeted and systematic system of inspections where spot checks are used when they are needed, as they were certainly needed on 16 February when it was necessary to go in and make that report. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I was quite interested to read in the Herald Sun and I think also in the Telegraph on the weekend an analysis which had been done by Access Economics on the new tax system under the heading `More dollars in your pocket'. The story reported:From July 1, Australian households will benefit to greatly varying degrees from mostly forgotten tax cuts. The biggest tax cut winners will be single income families with young children, and sole parents. A single income family on $30,000 a year with two children will gain an extra $73 a week from tax cuts while paying about $14 extra in GST.This analysis done by Access Economics appears to have been done making allowance for the effects of the GST on the basis not of a uniform CPI inflator but of differences in the cost of living in consumption baskets for each of the categories of cameos it selected. It does not allow for differences in consumption patterns within each of these groups. That is a different basis to that which the government itself presented in the policy which it took to the last election - a new tax system. Nonetheless, the analysis shows that in every category at every income level people are better off due to reductions in income tax and increases in family allowances. In fact, it is families who are the biggest winners under the new tax system. As Mr Richardson said - -   - The volume of interjection always goes up when they are most embarrassed. Let me say again: families will be the biggest winners under the government's new tax system. As Mr Richardson says in this article:If you are a single income family on $30,000 which has been waiting for years to update your family car all your Christmases will have come at once. In technical terms, this is a bloody big tax cut.I do not know if that is parliamentary language, Mr Speaker. - It was not even technical language, as the Prime Minister says. A one-income family on $40,000 with two children, one below five, with not only income tax cuts but also increased family benefits will be a total of $47.57 better off a week. That is the government's policy. What is the Labor Party's policy? The Labor Party's policy is to keep the GST and to take away the income tax cuts. They have form on this. This was the position before the 1993 election. Before the 1993 election, Mr Speaker, you will recall that they were going to oppose the GST, and when they got elected they increased every level of wholesale sales tax and the income tax cuts, which they had said were l-a-w, were taken away in their entirety. The l-a-w tax cuts never saw one dollar for one day whilst they increased every indirect wholesale sales tax, took leaded and unleaded petrol up - one by five and one by seven cents, as I recall. What a policy - a policy to keep GST and increase income taxes. On this side of the parliament we have always believed that families deserve benefits, and that is why we are cutting income taxes, why we are increasing family benefits and why we are bringing a new tax system in Australia. </DOC>

 - The fact that we have had 4,000 complaints means that the promotion of the scheme is actually being paid heed to. We established a complaints mechanism whereby, for the first time, complaints could be made anonymously so that residents or their loved ones could make complaints without feeling intimidated. Indeed, I will repeat the free-call number: 1800 550 552. The fact is that 90 per cent of those nearly 4,000 complaints have been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties. Many of those complaints are important to residents but they may not seem important to you. It can be an allegation that somebody stole underwear or a nightdress. It can be a complaint that food does not taste nice. It can be a whole range of things that are properly dealt with -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is very important to understand that the reforms are designed to bring transparency to the system and to see that there are sanctions that can be used when they are needed. There was never a complaints mechanism before which enabled people to make anonymous complaints to bring to light those things which need to be got out into the open in order that they can be dealt with. It was legion: everybody knew that there were problems with residential age care, with nursing homes, for decades. It was common parlance, but nothing was done. It was not until we put in place the whole reform package that we started to see some transparency brought into the system where we could address the needs. - Just to conclude, Mr Speaker, I would simply say to anyone who has a complaint to make: please make it so that we can investigate it.</DOC>

 - Last December the government announced the 205 organisations that were being offered work under Job Network 2. Eight small agencies ultimately declined those offers, but I am delighted to tell the House that Job Network 2 still represents an unprecedented expansion of the scope and reach of employment services. - The total sites are up from under 1,400 to nearly 2,100; non-metropolitan sites nearly double in number from 600 to about 1,100. In the electorate of Fairfax, for instance, there were just two employment service sites in the days of the old CES; there were 14 under Job Network 1 and there will be 18 under Job Network 2. On day one of Job Network 2, which was last Monday, 90 per cent of sites were open for business. I am advised that nearly 2,000 Job Network sites are now open, with the rest to follow by the end of the month. Job Network 2 meant creating more than 1,000 new sites from scratch in under three months - hundreds of new sites, thousands of staff, millions of dollars worth of new equipment. It was in fact one of the largest and most complex logistical operations ever undertaken in Australia, and I would like to congratulate all Job Network members and my department for managing such a smooth transition.I have been asked about other recent proposals for delivering employment services. While the government has been getting on with the job, members opposite have been trying to devise a policy. Last March the Leader of the Opposition said that he would shortly deliver a speech containing the `skeleton of a substantial series of initiatives'. As it turned out, the speech devoted just 35 words to employment issues - a very rare example of the Leader of the Opposition failing to be interminably prolix. Last week the ALP finally produced a policy document -  - It was not a policy document - she admits it. So they still have no policy! It certainly was not a policy for today; it was actually a piece of crystal ball gazing for 2010.The member for Dickson said that policy should be about skills, skills, skills. Unfortunately, Labor's 2010 document said that the number of skilled jobs in communications and finance would actually fall. In fact, the document which the opposition is so proud of said that 40 per cent of new jobs would be for clerks, sales assistants and labourers, presumably with university degrees under Labor's skills policy. The member for Dickson said that employment services should be available to everyone, not just to people who have lost their jobs. This has been conservatively costed at an extra $600 million a year - so goodbye to the GST roll-back and goodbye to income tax cuts if the ALP are ever lucky enough to get into government again. This all shows that the Leader of the Opposition might have a new personal trainer but he still has not got any ticker and he still has not got a fair dinkum employment policy.</DOC>

 - In this obsession with spot checks of the opposition's, I presume you are referring to spot checks by the agency, although you have not made that clear. But I presume that you are. There are other checks in the system as well. You know perfectly well that Mr Burns, who was the chief executive of the agency, gave evidence at the estimates committee which said that, as of that date, he had not used that power. However, as I explained to the House when I came in on 16 February, it was used on 16 February. It was used again in the subsequent one, and others have been done - one in Western Australia, to my knowledge, as well as one in Victoria - where that power was deemed necessary. As I said, I presume you are asking about the spot checks of the agency, and that is the way in which they have been used.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dawson. She certainly has a very strong commitment to families. Even last week, we opened a new Centrelink office and a child support service there, both geared towards families. The important point is that this government is absolutely committed to ensuring better payments and services to families. Part of that is achieved through the Family Assistance Office where, instead of having to go to three agencies, you can go to to get that information.For families, the bottom line is that, if you have one child, you are expected to get at least an extra $140 per year. With children under five, it is $350. As the Treasurer very accurately said, for families with children under five, we are talking about their being an extra $47 a week better off. It is about getting better payments to assist in child-care assistance and family assistance. Why would Labor want to take this away? Why would they? Let us look at the policy, or lack of policy, of the Australian Labor Party - lack of policy because they are more interested in scaring families than in supporting families. A very good element of this is the so-called family insecurity index of the member for Lilley which is based more on scaremongering than on substance. Perhaps we should look at this farcical index, which I know that the member for Lilley is very proud of. The first point, of course, is that the index was created going back to 1995. People were not particularly secure then, were they? Of course they weren't, when he was the member of the caucus committee. Let us look at how the index is put together. There are 61 numbers used in the construction - 29 of them are wrong. If you are going to have a good index, I would imagine that you should have good social indicators. Of course there are none of those. Most of the index components are irrelevant and they are weighed incorrectly. This is their policy for families: a bogus insecurity index. We know that you are very good at cooking the books, we know that you are very good at scaring people, but our policy is very simple: we are here to support families through big tax cuts, through extra child-care assistance, not through scaring people with bogus insecurity indexes. </DOC>

 - Without looking at the Hansard, what I recall telling the parliament is that we still had the power to do spot checks. Indeed, I recall going into some detail as to where it was provided for in the legislation. I also recall saying that we would use tools when they were necessary.I might say that the agency needed the tool to be used on 16 February and, if I might add, it was used on 6 March when a serious complaint had been given that a resident had told a doctor that a male carer at a particular home had hit him. That was the subject of a referral to the police, as it ought to be, but in order to follow up where there is such a serious allegation a spot check has been made. This is the sort of use when you need that tool. Otherwise, targeted and comprehensive visits in order to bring homes up to standard is the policy that is pursued. Spot checks are there to be used when the agency believes there is the need to so use.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for the question, and I would like to congratulate him and his colleagues of the backbench in Queensland for standing up to the campaign being run against them by the Queensland state government for one reason only: that these people have analysed a particular proposal, have found it detrimental to the constituents they represent and are standing up for those constituents. I also thank the Prime Minister for agreeing with their representations.The simple fact arising out of that particular proposal is that 100 direct jobs will be lost in Eidsvold, Theodore and Cooroy in the reasonably near future because those mills have been bought out by the Queensland government and the previous owner told to close them. This, of course, has got to be added to the fact that there is very regular opinion arising from mayors in the district and contractors in the district that the promised sawmill quotas that have been given under this agreement cannot be sustained and there will be further mill closures.  It is very clear what the local coalition members have done. They have analysed the situation, consulted with the local people and stood up for their people. In that period of time have I received one representation from a Labor MP or senator? Not one. There is a senator in Queensland whose father runs the AWU - noted for their silence but not for their action on this issue. The National Forest Policy Statement was written by the Labor Party and, like every other policy that they used to have, they have found it easier now not to have them at all because you cannot get into trouble that way, they think. But the reality is that that policy says that you must consider the social impacts, and not one Labor member is contacting me and saying, `Look, here is a solution. If you did it this way instead of that way would it help the people in the Queensland region?' In other states we continue to proceed with the negotiation of regional forest agreements under the National Forest Policy Statement. There again local members in New South Wales from the coalition have been constantly in contact with me, constantly bringing issues to my attention, constantly making suggestions that allow us to match environmental demands with the social impact. Have I received such efforts from the member for Paterson? Not one. He keeps standing up in this place talking about some RFA that is supposed to be on my desk, but never ever do es he say anything. - And it is not a point of order to make a personal explanation. - It is one thing to try and ask questions to prove a political point. It is another to write and ask for information for the benefit of your constituents. I have never received anything by way of direct representation from the member for Paterson that has put an argument to defend workers' rights or in fact to suggest how additional timber supplies might be made available to keep them in work.The same applies in Victoria where we and the new state government are working through a very difficult issue. But do I ever get representations from the member for McMillan on how to try to fix the problem? He writes me a letter and says, `I am in favour of the RFA,' and when the legislation comes into this place he makes sure he is absent when his side voted against the only measure that will guarantee the sort of investment that is so necessary in his elector ate. - The only time I see the member for McMillan is when he is pushing up against me trying to get in a press photograph so that someone knows he exists. - There is a fundamental issue in all of this and that is the representation of the people who live in your electorate. The fundamental issue here is that the National Forest Policy Statement was endorsed by this government when it was in opposition, by every state Premier and by every state opposition for one reason: it was a good balanced proposal. - The embarrassment of the Labor Party - the party of no policy - in being reminded that they have ratted on their own policy, is made obvious by silly interjections of that nature which he made up as he sat in his chair. In fact, no self-respecting Liberal would talk to him because we know him as a creep.</DOC>

 - I came into the House on 16 February and explained to the House that I had found out about an incident on the 15th at 10 o'clock and that we had worked through the night. I referred it to the agency and put in a spot audit, a review audit, at 9 o'clock the next morning. That was a two-day audit, as is required under the legislation. The agency wrote the report and referred it to the delegate of the secretary, who made a decision that sanctions should be applied. That was communicated to the approved provider on the 22nd. Fourteen days can then run from that period, in which he has the time to respond. The publication of that report runs from a further 14 days from response.That was the situation that we were in when we received a further report from the nurses whom we had sent in on a continuing basis that there had been no apparent improvement at all, nor attempt to do so, that the administrator had not been put in place - the name is put forward by the provider; it must be approved by the secretary - and that there was sufficient concern on the part of the department who asked the agency to do a further two-day review, which it did, which resulted in the delegate of the secretary making the decision. That decision is what has transpired today - after the notice was served between 7.30 and 8 o'clock this morning. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for the opportunity to comment on some observations that have been made in relation to the way in which visitors are able to access Australia. The first point I should make, of course, is that the way in which this matter has been treated has not varied in all of the time that this government has been in office. In fact, the arrangements that we have in place are arrangements that were implemented under the former government. The implementation particularly of a risk factor profile, whereby some 43 countries are listed on the basis of past behaviour by visitor visa holders from those countries, where we assess that they are likely to overstay, has been a longstanding part of that system. The fact is that those measures were reviewed by a committee of the parliament in 1996, chaired by Senator Jim McKiernan. The committee at that time reported that, `The committee supports the principle of the risk factor profile that, while certain visitor refusal rates from posts in certain risk factor countries are high, large numbers of visitor applications at such posts are being approved.'In the light of the fact that the system has not changed and is applied by officers of the department with integrity, I am surprised that there have been comments by members of the parliament, particularly the member for Stirling, who in an article in the Sunday Telegraph of 27 February said that this is a `subtle form of racism'. I know that racism is the cheapest shot in the locker, but I was disappointed that the shadow minister, the member for Bowman, joined in those comments. He called the rejection statistics a `national disgrace'. He said that there are `similar problems with other nations such as Greece'. He said that, despite Greeks being the third biggest ethnic community in Australia, Greek women between 20 and 29 are classified as high risk and are almost automatically refused entry. - I am sure that, if the member had followed the practice of seeking some information in relation to this, he would have been advised by my officers that some 7,456 visitor visas were granted to Greek nationals in 1999, with only 16 refusals - a rejection rate of 0.021 per cent. - I do not know where he was picking it up from; maybe he has been talking to the member for Stirling. Maybe he thought that he should join in these sorts of cheap attacks in relation to a policy that is applied to benefit Australia.I would like to tell the member for Hume, because he asked the question specifically of what would be the impact of imposing the selection criteria that we use for high risk posts - which I might say simply involves us assessing all applicants against the criteria to see whether or not their visits are bona fide - that the impact of that would be to subject the millions of visitors to Australia, regardless of risk profiles, to the same sort of examination. If the policy of the Labor Party is to close down tourism in Australia and if the policy of the Labor Party is to deny all of the significant economic advantages by getting bona fide visitor applicants entered into Australia as effectively and as efficiently as possible, then let them put it openly. But do not let us have this covert game of some of your members going out like the member for Grayndler did, separating themselves out from the others -  - and suggesting - nudge, nudge, wink, wink - that maybe you will get a different approach from a Labor Party -  - because some of us are able to go out and say -   - `We are not following the policy line; we will be different' -  - If you are going to settle some policies and you are going to be able to be credible, sit down and work out a coherent response rather than hiving off in every direction.</DOC>

 - Mr       Speaker, when I spoke about the concept that there were nursing homes that were operating that should not, I recall that I was speaking in the context of something about which I have spoken a considerable number of times, and that is that it became necessary within the last two years for my own father to go into a nursing home. I made the statement that, in the course of finding a residential aged care facility for him, there were some that were, quite frankly, not acceptable for my dad. I subsequently made the statement that, if it is not acceptable for my dad, then it is not acceptable for anybody else's dad either. - I would ask you to kindly recall that that is something about which I feel quite passionate; I feel quite personally indebted for the care that my dad did receive in a nursing home, which provided excellent care.  - I do find that comment of `drivel' quite offensive. I would like it to be withdrawn. - Don't you dare! You withdraw that comment. - Quite clearly, what was in my mind at that time was that we needed to bring all aged care facilities up to standard. There was no particular one to which I was referring at that time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question, and I know his great interest in literacy. Parents now have the best ever indication of the state of literacy in Australia as all states but one have released the results of the 1999 assessments against the literacy benchmark. The one exception is New South Wales; under the Carr government the process has ground to a halt. Last year's results have not been released. The education unions have refused to test students for literacy in the early years of high school and the New South Wales Labor government has capitulated to the unions.One of the greatest impediments to lifting literacy standards in Australia is the willingness of the Labor Party to capitulate to union pressure on this vital issue. This is one of the most disgusting attacks on students in need that we have seen in Australia and one of the greatest assaults on equal opportunity for young Australians in education. And do not think that the Leader of the Opposition is going to stand up to the unions when they put pressure on him. Do not think he is going to take a stand for literacy. He had four lines in the policy at the last election. Indeed, we know his priorities. Peter Fitzsimons, on page 374 of his biography of the Leader of the Opposition, quotes him as saying:Everybody talks about the need for computers in schools, the need for literacy and all those sorts of things, but really the heart of the problem in the education system, I thought, was the morale of the teaching profession.Morale is important, but parents might be forgiven for thinking that literacy is important, that literacy has priority, that it is important to stand up for the rights of young people to learn to read and write, against the pressure of the unions. In the last election campaign, you capitulated to the unions with your literacy policy, and you are still capitulating to the unions with your literacy policy. That is why, when you were minister for education, 30 per cent of young Australians could not read and write properly. You were not interested in the portfolio, you were a failure in the portfolio, you were a weak minister - and it is time for you to show that you are prepared to stand up and be counted.</DOC>

Those statements were made publicly by me, and a press release was issued that outlined fully and precisely what action had been taken. Subsequently, I have outlined to you today what other action was taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. There is no doubt that those gains which we have seen in recent years are at risk. We have seen 600,000 jobs created, a big improvement in productivity and higher pay for workers, particularly low paid workers. We have seen a big improvement in the real value of their pay. Contrary to all the claims of our political opponents, the number of industrial disputes in Australia has come down as a result of reforms, amongst other things, that we have introduced.  -  - That figure on your long-term disputes is wrong as well. There was a conference in Melbourne, I am told - I did not attend this section of it - where the shadow minister made that very claim and he was soon put down by Mark Wooden, who really does know what he is talking about. We see the same threat federally as we are seeing happen in reality in the state of Victoria. A Labor government has been elected and already, without any legislation, the climate for investment and the creation of jobs is taking jobs out of Victoria, at a very heavy price for all Victorians.The framework of policy under Labor, if Labor were ever to be elected, is slowly coming out into the marketplace. We had the submission by the member for Charlton the other day. She is in favour of the abolition of all individual agreements - Australian workplace agreements. These would be abolished under Labor. Labor have already said they will abolish the Employment Advocate, one of whose jobs is to protect employees and provide basic protection of their rights as employees. And now we see from the Financial Review this morning that another document is out and about. This one apparently is entitled `Draft of ALP policy'. As we always say, their policy is drafted by the unions. This one actually says that on the front of it.Under this proposal we have all the usual pro-union policies so enamoured of the Labor Party and the people who push them around, namely, the trade union leadership. There will be right of entry into every business. Whatever your small business, the Labor Party will give a union official - even when there are no union members in your business - the right to walk in and push you around. The unions will be given a right, effectively, to veto agreements between employers and employees even when not one member of that business is a member of a union. In that respect there are something like 200,000 employees covered by direct agreements with employers. Those agreements will be out the window because they are not union agreements as required by the Labor Party.The latest union membership numbers show a further decline in trade union members. Yet, as their numbers decline, the power and influence over the frontbench by the trade union movement grows. Under their policy, you would have patent bargaining given a complete green light - industry-wide sectors being allowed to bargain, regardless of the circumstances of business. The unions are talking about setting up sectoral councils, so you will have a manufacturing council, a maritime council and a building industry council. Those opposite laugh, but that is their policy being dictated to them by the trade union movement. It will do nothing but cost jobs. Not only do they look after their mates in terms of increased power to the unions; there is also a proposal to provide new funding for unions to allow them to take legal action against employers, paid for by the taxpayers at substantial cost. But, again, who is in the gun? It is the small business person who cannot afford the legal fees when being pursued by their union mates. - The fact is that, in the end, this is just an attack on small business at the behest of an increasingly irrelevant trade union movement which finds nothing easier than pushing around -  - the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to policy and pursuing their own benefits. On tax, as the Treasurer says, it is a roll back policy in dealing with Labor state premiers and giving them what they want. When it comes to the unions, it is a rollover policy.</DOC>

It was then that we moved straight into action, worked right through the night -  -  - It might come as a surprise to you, but this is the time of the year when meetings are held with regard to budget initiatives and it is very important that work is continuing. It was at the end of a long meeting when I was told by one of my officials that this had occurred. That is when we moved.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that Australia now has the best and most advanced air traffic control system in the world. Last week I was able to commission the Australian advanced air traffic system, or TAAATS. TAAATS is the first fully integrated air traffic control system in the world. It pulls together the results of radar surveillance, GPS position fixes and aircraft flight plans to provide controllers with the best information available about the planes under their control. It is, as I say, quite simply leading edge globally. It has been completed with more than 60 per cent of Australian involvement, including John Holland Constructions and AWA Plessey, which is a company that has had a very long involvement in Australian aviation.It is worth noting that Airservices Australia has won no less than three prestigious awards over recent times. In 1999, it won the Eagle award from the International Air Transport Association as the best provider of air traffic services in the world. That is something that all Australians can be very proud of. In fact, something like 20 countries are now lining up to look at what has been achieved here in this country, including the United States, China and Indonesia, who have all sent inspectors to have a look at the new approach. It is widely rumoured that one country has spent several billion dollars trying to achieve what we managed to pull together. They gave up. We have got it in place for $377 million.There are real safety advantages. There are real gains in efficiencies. There will be real cost reductions for the aviation industry and therefore for the travelling public in the future. This is very much a good news story. It is a story of outstanding project management. It is a story about great team work. It is a story about Australian innovation in the high-tech field where we have been able to show that we can outdo the world's best.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and acknowledge the fine work that he does in representing the citizens of Deakin. Of course, under the new tax system not only are we introducing the largest personal income tax cut in Australia's history but we are totally reforming Commonwealth-state financial relations. The states will be given all of the revenue from GST. May I say that again: the states will be given all of the revenue from GST, which will allow them to abolish their current inefficient indirect tax bases and will also mean that the annual bunfight at the Premiers Conference, when they come to Canberra looking for money, will be over.This is, of course, of great assistance to the states. That is why the Labor Party is ostentatiously trying to engage in conversation at the moment to try to ignore the benefits that are available to the states. When we were in opposition, we used to try this trick too. You would turn around to your frontbench and talk in loud voices so you would not have to put up with the bad news. It will not actually give the Leader of the Opposition any inspiration. As the Labor chat room yesterday said, `In the talentless Labor frontbench, things are so bad that Laurie Brereton is now being talked of seriously.' If, of course, the GST should be rolled back, the states would be the losers, and if the states were the losers the Commonwealth guarantee recently announced by the Leader of the Opposition would mean that the Commonwealth would have to make up the difference. Not only would it have to make up the difference; it would have no goods taxes to make it up from, so it would come out of income tax. The Leader of the Opposition has hooked himself on his own petard. He was asked recently about where he would actually roll back the goods and services tax, and this is what he said yesterday - listen to this for a clear enunciation of Labor Party policy. For four years he has been thinking about his roll-back policy, and this is the little gem he came up with yesterday. Mr Beazley said:This is why I sensibly have taken the view that, after announcing that, in principle, we're committed to rollback and not rollback just immediately ... certainly roll-back immediately ... but over time, we have given ourselves the flexibility to look at the budgetary circumstances at the time.This is not prolix; this is gobbledegook. He might as well say to the press gallery, `Get used to gobbledegook.' The fact is that he is on an uncharted road to an unknown destination with no means of paying for it and no policy. He is like a rolling stone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I think it is appropriate also to note, Mr Speaker, that the member for Herbert is well known in this chamber as a great advocate for the ADF in Townsville. I think that is recognised on both sides of the House because he does do a good job for his constituents. The government's tax reforms provide significant benefits to the small business community. In fact, the small business community has consistently been in favour of genuine and comprehensive tax reform for many years, including the introduction of a goods and services tax. They have also supported the very significant reductions in income tax which are included in the package. The small business community will be beneficiaries of those huge reductions in income tax. They have also been in favour of the abolition of the hidden indirect tax which the Labor Party has had in operation for many years - the wholesale sales tax. One of the reasons they are in favour of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax is that it takes the cost off business and, if you can reduce the cost of doing business, that provides a benefit not only to small business but also to the people that they employ. The small business community is also very much in favour of the abolition of provisional tax. Provisional tax has sent many businesses broke over the years. The abolition of provisional tax is the culmination of a long campaign by the small business community to achieve that objective. When the government was first elected back in 1996, we had a committee look at reducing red tape. One of the recommendations of the committee, which comprised people from small business, was that we introduce a system known as pay as you go. The reason that small business sees that as reducing red tape is that it will see a reduction in the number of forms having to be filled out by small business down to one simplified, single system - the pay as you go system. So that is also a significant plus for the small business community.Obviously, there are transition issues with the introduction of the new package, and for that reason the government has set about the biggest information and education campaign for a tax change in Australia's history. There have been literally thousands of seminars, and a whole range of services provided, particularly to small business, to enable them to make that change. An amount of $500 million has been set aside for that task and, on top of that, $175 million as the benefit to small business from immediate tax deductibility of items purchased as they get set up for the GST.I think the small business community would be aghast to now find out that, if the Labor Party were ever to be elected, the first thing they would do would be to move what they call a series of changes or roll-backs to the GST, adding significantly to the compliance costs for the small business community. After running around the country saying that they are concerned about small business and red tape, their policy is in fact to load them up with a whole lot of red tape if ever they are elected. To add insult to injury, it is the Labor Party's policy to pay for the deal they have offered to the state premiers with an increase in income tax. Who do you think is going to pay the increase in income tax? None other than small business. Not only will it affect them in respect of income tax; whilst this government has been reducing capital gains tax, the Labor Party's increases in income tax will mean increases in capital gains tax for the small business community.One of the best things we have done was to halve capital gains tax. Now it is Labor Party policy to put it up. The small business community is part of the great dynamic of the Australian economy, creating jobs. In the end, if we look after small business, we get more jobs and we get higher living standards. Our policy supports them. It seems, again, that Labor's policy is to tax small business.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm to the honourable member for Mallee that farmers in his electorate and around Australia will indeed gain very real benefits from the government's new tax system - a billion dollars worth of cuts in their expenditure, reduced income tax and improved benefits for their families. All of those things are very important for rural and regional Australians. I can also confirm that I have heard reports that there are some alternative ideas around. After three years of telling us how evil the goods and services tax is and of being unable to persuade anybody, other than the people of Botswana and Swaziland, that they have a better system, Labor have finally decided, `Well, we'll keep the GST after all. It won't be quite the same; we're just going to roll it back. But we'll keep it. It's evil. We don't like it but we'll just roll it back.' They have not told us how it is going to be rolled back, whether they are going to reduce the rate from 10 per cent to nine per cent, or what other measures they might have in mind. Most farmers will remember the last time Labor promised to reduce taxes. Remember the l-a-w tax cuts? That is the last time they rolled back taxes. They actually went up! So, if anybody is looking around for any reductions, I think they should probably look at Labor's form on this issue and they will know they will not be receiving much benefit. Just in case Labor are proposing to actually reduce the revenue from the GST, it is perhaps time they told Australian farmers, and indeed other people, who will be the losers from this loss of revenue. For instance, are the opposition aware that, under the new tax system, 70 per cent of Australian farmers will pay no more income tax than 17 cents in the dollar? Seventy per cent of all Australian farmers will pay 17 cents in the dollar or less, and many more will pay none. Is that what Labor is going to roll back?Are they also aware that Australian families are going to get very significant income tax cuts? A family with two children, with one under age five, will get a tax cut of $71 a week. Is that what they are going to roll back? The tax cuts? What about the reductions in costs, including reduced fuel costs? Is that what they are going to roll back? This is the sort of thing that Labor is telling us about. I think it is about time, if they are going to roll back taxes, that they started giving assurances to farmers that the real benefits that are going to be provided under this tax package are not going to be rolled back - that there will not be a roll-back on the tax cuts and that there will not be a roll-back on the savings that farmers will receive. Only when we get that assurance can anybody have any kind of confidence as to what Labor proposes for the future. The reality is: Labor is going to roll back all right; they are going to roll back the real benefits that are available under the new tax system.</DOC>

 - I am aware of several targets for educational qualifications which have come into the public arena as a result of the Labor Party's lapsing into confusion as it attempts to formulate an education policy. Let me run through this record of confusion of the last two weeks as the Leader of the Opposition attempts to formulate at least some educational goal. The confusion started on the Sunday program a fortnight ago, when the Leader of the Opposition stated that, in his view, the most important educational target was that `every young person should exit their teens with a post-school qualification' - that is, every young person should have a post school qualification: a degree, a diploma or some trade qualification. At present, 12.8 per cent of young people have that qualification. The Leader of the Opposition is proposing to raise that to 100 per cent, apparently. Labor sources quickly came to the rescue and said that this was a mistake and that the Leader of the Opposition overstated this target. There was a letter to the Australian from the Leader of the Opposition stating what target he actually said the Labor Party was aiming at. He rolled it back. The big roll-back had begun; it had rolled back from 100 per cent. He stated: What we want by 2010 is at least 90 per cent of young people leaving their teens to have a Year 12 or equivalent qualification - He did not say a degree or a diploma but a year 12 qualification. He said that would not be too hard because in the last decade we have actually been at levels just like that. He was wrong again. There has been no time in the last decade when there has been any figure like 90 per cent reached. Australia was never near 90 per cent for year 12 retention. The highest figure reached was around 76 per cent, and that was when Kim Beazley was pumping up youth unemployment and young people had virtually no option but to go back into school. When Labor left office the figure was nearer to 70 per cent - nowhere near 90 per cent. He was wrong again.Last night, we had the member for Dobell at the Sydney Institute rolling back this target yet again. He scaled it back in this way. He said that what Labor was really aiming to achieve was 90 per cent year 12 retention by 2010. That is equivalent to an 82 per cent year 12 qualification rate. So an eight per cent gap has now opened up between the target of the Leader of the Opposition and the target of the member for Dobell. What we have here is total confusion. We have another example of an uncharted journey leading to an unknown destination; and I do not know whether we are at the destination now, because we have total confusion in relation to the educational targets of the opposition.The Leader of the Opposition was a complete failure as minister for education. He achieved nothing in that portfolio; he was not interested in the portfolio. He was not able to state any sensible educational goals then, and the opposition today has no sensible, credible educational goals on the table - it just has total confusion. In education as in the GST, it is on an uncharted journey leading to an uncertain destination. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question, because it does give me an opportunity to deal with a very difficult issue and one which is of concern to me and, I believe, most members of the House. Members would be aware that Australia has, by world standards, a generous approach to resettling refugees and humanitarian entrants and that per capita our program for resettlement has been the largest in the world. Last year, in response to the situation in Kosovo and East Timor, we saw an effective increase of 50 per cent in the numbers of people whom we were able to assist. So we are the most generous in per capita terms in the world. We saw a 50 per cent increase.But there are some people who seem to believe that you can go on indefinitely accommodating additional numbers of people in the refugee and humanitarian program. For instance, the member for Grayndler is of the view that you should allow all people who arrive in Australia unlawfully and who obtain refugee status to simply be added to the program and to be an additional charge upon the budget as a result of their accommodation. The member for Oxley believes that something of the order of 500 Vietnamese people in Hong Kong and the Philippines ought to be accommodated in the refugee and humanitarian program. The member for Bowman believes that the Kosovars and the Timorese who remain in Australia should be allowed to remain here as an additional component of the refugee and humanitarian program. None of them has argued that they ought to find their places at the expense of those people who would access the program on the basis of need now.The fact of the matter is that, if you were to add all of those people who have come to Australia unlawfully and who are likely to be accepted and who are in the process now, you have something of the order of 4,000 additional places. If you make the assumption - which is not unreasonable - that we may have people continuing to arrive in Australia who have similar backgrounds and who are likely to succeed in making those claims, then we are probably looking at 6,000 people. If you assume that you continue to conduct policies in a way which would accommodate those sorts of arrivals and those sorts of numbers, you would be looking at similar numbers of people having to be accommodated next year. The cost to the forward estimates per thousand is $21.5 million; 4,000 people and you are looking at $83 million cost to the forward estimates; 6,000 people would be $120 million to the forward estimates. If you take it year in, year out, you have got another $100 million or more each year to the forward estimates. I put the question to the honourable member for Grayndler - he sits there as quasi-frontbench material; he sits there as a parliamentary secretary - `This involves fiscal responsibility,' and he said, `I accept that absolutely.' Does that mean, in addition to rolling back the GST, they are out there walking both sides of the street, pretending to people that they are able to increase government expenditure without regard to any fiscal responsibility? Clearly, the question that has to be answered is not by the member for Grayndler and not by the shadow minister, because he is trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue, but by the Leader of the Opposition. Is he going to pull them into line and say, `We want to have fiscal credibility,' or is he going to be out there holding out to some groups in the community that the Labor Party is going to find those extra funds and fit them into the forward estimates but try to pretend that they are not doing so? </DOC>

 - It is fortuitous that you asked the question because I now have the answer on the Alchera Park Nursing Home. The points are these: the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme received several complaints on 16 November 1999 concerning standards of care for three residents of Alchera Park Nursing Home who subsequently died in Gladstone Hospital. Following preliminary investigations, the complaints resolution scheme met with representatives from the facility on 22 November 1999 and subsequently referred the matter to the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency on 25 November. The agency undertook a full review of standards at the home on 30 November and 1 December, which identified three areas of concern, and an immediate improvement plan was developed. The agency is continuing to monitor the facility to ensure that the improvements outlined in the improvement plan are implemented and that systems are in place to ensure continued adherence to them. With the agreement of all complainants, these complaints were finalised on 18 January 2000 on the basis of the actions put in place to remedy previous care problems.</DOC>

 - One of the important reforms that the government is pursuing in transport, where we think reform is important, is the rolling out of higher mass limits. Higher mass limits further extend the use of -  - I will come to that in a moment. This allows for the more effective loading of heavy trucks and leads to an increase in efficiency in the trucking industry and a reduction in the number of trucks on our roads for a given freight task. The total estimated value to the Australian economy is about $850 million a year - a worthwhile reform. In pursuit of it - and we at Commonwealth government level have been pursuing this vigorously - I announced yesterday a further $30 million for bridge upgrading across Australia, particularly for bridges off the national highway, with an emphasis on routes which will foster regional development. That is in addition to the $30 million or so that we have already made available for bridges on the national highway. One criterion for considering applications is whether or not state and local governments will put money in as well, which gives us the opportunity to extend the money a lot further. This worthwhile reform will certainly benefit rural and regional Australia and deliver real benefits to the overall economy. But guess who is opposing the rollout of this important reform? The ALP. They are not interested in rolling out more roads; they are more interested in standing in the way of reform. The NSW Labor government will not move to roll out this very important reform. They have consistently held back the potential that can be unleashed from this ongoing issue of transport efficiency in this country. However, I make the point that we are not churlish: the money, the offer, is on the table and we will leave it there. Eventually NSW will have to come to the party.That same obstructionist approach to reform in transport can be seen in this place. It is worth recalling that in 1991 the ALP, at federal level, gave up on a sensible, strategic approach to road reform in Australia. They got out of funding important regional roads for development, for example. Guess who was the minister for transport at the time? It was the same fellow who cannot cope with reform at the moment - the Leader of the Opposition. Another example of their unwillingness to progress vitally important reforms which are important in a social sense as well was their abandonment of the black spots program. We are putting around $40 million a year into this program. It is being used to eliminate around 400 serious accident spots a year. That investment of $40 million a year is estimated to be saving eight lives a year and around 320 serious crashes. That is a very valuable investment in reform. So there you have it. The ALP, presented with opportunities to support strong reform, walked away from regional development and the role that road development could play in it when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for transport. They walked away from black spots. The tiger does not change its spots. They are still opposing reform in NSW of a sort that can produce real benefits for the national economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When we came to government four years ago there were very limited ways in which people in rural Australia could claim under Medicare. In the last four years we have substantially increased the way that this can be done. Of course, there are the traditional Medicare offices, 100 of which are in rural Australia out of a total of 226 right around the country. We have not closed any offices in rural Australia in four years. But we have introduced other facilities such as telephone claiming; a very popular `facsimile machines in pharmacies' scheme which gives 500 pharmacies around Australia the mechanism whereby people can go in and submit Medicare claims to the Health Insurance Commission; two-way agency agreements between private health funds and the Health Insurance Commission, because there are some rural centres that have private health fund offices but not Medicare offices; and of course our rural transaction centres.In addition to these, we have undergone pilot programs of touch-screen kiosks in the Northern Territory and Victoria. These are presently being evaluated, and we believe they will be highly successful and highly acceptable. We have undergone a pilot of electronic lodgment of Medicare claims directly from the doctor's surgery. This trial has been quite successful, and the research by the Health Insurance Commission shows it is highly acceptable to the public. We hope to roll this out further so that by July this year doctors who have compatible computer software will be able to be on line, and doctors without compatible computer software will be able to offer this service by the end of the year. So there are six different ways that people can claim from Medicare. The most significant and extensive of these are the 500 pharmacy claiming agencies.  I was interested to note, some weeks ago, that the Leader of the Opposition did actually mention the `H' word - health - in a doorstop in Launceston when he was announcing his new policy of post offices for government services. Unfortunately, a journalist got in the way. They do have a habit of asking difficult questions. I will quote from the transcript: `Journalist: Mr Beazley, Australia Post already offers banking and Telstra. What other services do you envisage?' I will not read out the answer; it is 11 lines of absolutely nothing. Then the journalist asked the drop-dead question: `But what sort of services?' `Well, it could be services related to health.' This is wonderful, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition spends all morning with his shadow cabinet discussing these services and, when asked what they will do, the first thing off the top of his mind is health. Clearly he has no understanding that the fact is that every doctor in Australia will be able to be a Medicare claiming point by the end of the year, and that the 500 pharmacies that already enable claims under Medicare will, each and every one of them, have those facilities threatened if Medicare claiming facilities are put in post offices. It is also curious that he should choose post offices, given that Labor closed 277 postal outlets in rural Australia between 1989 and 1995. This is an example of policy on the run, and it is an example of the Leader of the Opposition and an opposition that clearly do not understand what is going on in health.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I have been asked about the ongoing achievements of Work for the Dole, which of course is one of the signature programs and significant successes of the Howard government. So far 57,000 young Australians have participated, over 1,500 projects have commenced and 34 per cent of participants have gone into paid employment, and this compares very favourably with achievements from the former government's Working Nation policy. Over 80 per cent of participants in Work for the Dole report that their involvement in the project has increased their determination to find work. But I have been asked about threats to this program.  Unfortunately, a handful of unions have been trying their best to sabotage Work for the Dole projects. Last year the head office of the Australian Workers Union vetoed five projects in New South Wales national parks that would have provided work experience to more than 500 young Australians. In the past few weeks, the Commonwealth Public Sector Union has tried to sabotage the chances of 150 young Australians to gain work skills in gardening, office administration and librarianship through projects in Perth schools. The Australian Education Union has also tried to sabotage similar Work for the Dole projects in Canberra schools for 40 participants. I call on the parliamentary representatives of the CPSU, the Labor members for Lalor, Capricornia, Bass, Jagajaga, Lowe and Sydney, to follow the lead of their distinguished colleague the member for Batman, who was not a bad employment spokesman in the end, in urging community organisations to work with this great program.On the subject of threats, between 1992 and 1996 Brisbane City Council placed 3,000 participants in various labour market programs and received nearly $30 million in federal funds for doing so. But the number of Work for the Dole places filled by that council is not 3,000, not 2,000, not 1,000, but zero, even though 30 other Queensland councils, many of them Labor controlled, have participated, even though the council has been approached by a number of great Australian charities to get involved, and even though my friend and colleague the member for Moreton has received no fewer than 330 letters of support for Work for the Dole from his electorate alone. Why is Jim Soorley trying to deny young Queenslanders this chance to show their mettle? The greatest threat of all to this program comes from members opposite who have been frogmarched by their union paymasters into opposing Work for the Dole.Where does the member for Dickson stand on this? Is she as confused about Work for the Dole as she is about whether the document she recently launched is a policy or a mere forecast? Is she as confused about Work for the Dole as she is about whether she wants to be shadow employment minister at all? When she was the leader of the Democrats, she called Work for the Dole `disgraceful, divisive politics from the Prime Minister'. Presumably she was just posturing then, because she ultimately passed the thing. But where does she stand now? If a policy is too much to ask, an updated opinion will do. And, if she says that it needs accredited training, she has got to tell us where the money is going to come from because, without that, we have to assume that if Labor ever get into government it will be goodbye to GST roll-back and goodbye to the prospect of tax cuts for ordinary Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for his question and the significant support he and the member for Corangamite, the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, and the member for Wannon have provided me in addressing some serious problems relative to the remaining two regional forest agreements in Victoria. Unfortunately, if the literal interpretation of the assessment that has been produced by way of a discussion paper was applied, there would be serious industry cutbacks, due to a reduced sawlog resource, and substantial job losses, estimated by some in the hundreds.Such a discussion paper is put out for that purpose. At the request of the members I have just mentioned and with their assistance, I have been able to get into discussion with people who know the forest - that is, the people who work within it and process its products - to try and find solutions within a sustainable management environment. I am encouraged by a number of suggestions that would save jobs and I have been able to have officers of my department inspect areas of the forest where we think assistance could arise. In that regard, although I will continue to make our point of view known,  I have been disappointed by correspondence recently from the state government of Victoria, recently elected by votes from these regions, implying to me that they would want $5 million for the purpose of making workers redundant. We would treat that issue extremely seriously. It is one for which we are very hopeful that we can find solutions. Our policy is to use the funds available in the Commonwealth budget to create work opportunities and find solutions. The last thing we need is a state government already coming to the conclusion that jobs are to be lost.Yesterday I really did give an opportunity to the members representing local Labor electorates to assist me in this task. Of course, they did not stay around very long to do that, and I inform the House that, 24 hours later, I still have nothing from the member for McMillan that would contribute to a process of finding solutions. I mean, he is the local member, and one would think that he could bring some local knowledge. It might be that he is waiting for me to make another visit to his electorate in order to communicate with me. I just hope that, in any public meeting, he does it loudly enough so that I can stop telling people he is not my grandson along for the ride - because he sticks to me like glue as though he were going to get lost.All members have a responsibility in this regard. The member for Paterson stood up on a point of order here yesterday and said that he had actually put a question on notice to me that was evidence of his concern. The question on notice was all about New South Wales state legislation, and I do not know what that has to do with it. But, coming back to Victoria, whilst I have not received any communication from Labor members - state or federal - I have received communications from the CFMEU, who say that unions warn, `No forest reserves if jobs lost.' I quote their spokesman, Mr O'Connor: `We are not having new national parks in Victoria being paid for by the jobs of blue-collar workers in the bush and struggling rural communities.' One would have thought that to be the first ultimatum I would have received from the member for McMillan. But Mr O'Connor has lost confidence in the Labor Party. In another release entitled `CFMEU slams Beazley', he says: `Beazley has torn up national ALP policy and has deceived workers, their families and communities in regional Australia and he signals that the federal ALP are out to get timber workers.' Going by their lack of activity, that allegation appears to be true. It is significant of the party. When it comes to people's right to work, what do you stand for? Why don't you just chuckle about it? I want to know what you stand for. But the fundamental issues are that the government is getting on with finding solutions to protect those workers' jobs. The members for Ballarat, Corangamite, Wannon and Gippsland are all out there knocking on my door saying, `Have you thought of this? Have you thought of that? Let's find a solution within the policy.' But not one word from the Labor Party. They do not care about jobs. </DOC>

 - I will deal firstly with the Fuller report. My department does have a copy of that report, but unfortunately the report does not make any reference to any aged care service. When the matter was raised with me on the 7.30 Report, and Ms Fuller was on that television program, I said I would like to meet with her and discuss it. I did precisely that. I found her and we spent several hours together on the Sunday. I put her in touch with my department. In the meantime, the department had been working on the report, but I would point out to you that Ms Fuller had also sent approximately five copies of her report, which do not specify which facilities were involved, to New South Wales Health, which has the responsibility for dealing with medications. I would simply refer you to schedule 1 of the principles, where it is set out quite specifically that all facilities must comply with state and federal legislation as it pertains to medication and drugs.Having put Ms Fuller together with people in my department, we are working to see if there can be better coordination of responsibilities between state and federal governments because it seems quite plain that there is not the necessary coordination going on. Indeed, I have written to Minister Craig Knowles in the New South Wales government and asked him to tell me what action he takes to monitor his legislation and what legislation underpins it, so that coordination can happen. Unless the Leader of the Opposition has any misunderstanding -  - of the nature of the reports that are made to me, they are in summary form and look a trifle like that. - No, the document is marked `confidential'.</DOC>

 - The member for Dunkley's question raises a matter of real concern to a lot of Victorians - in fact, most Victorians - brought home sharply by recent develop-ments, where we saw power restrict-ions in the state as a result of industrial action. Sadly in Victoria we are now seeing in action what happens when you get a Labor Party elected, particularly a Labor Party with a weak leader in the new Premier, Steve Bracks. In respect of the building industry, for example, in Sydney under the federal law the building union settled up at 15 per cent over three years. But in Victoria, because Mr Bracks is a weak leader, a pushover and a roll-back leader of the sort we now have federally, they think they can get not 15 per cent but 24 per cent and work less for it with a 36-hour week claim. Even as late as this morning on 3AW radio in Melbourne, when he was asked about the 36-hour week, all Mr Bracks could say was, `I am urging compromise.' We urge on Mr Bracks a bit of leadership to stand up and say to these unions that this is unaffordable for the state of Victoria. In the state of Victoria in the last few weeks we have already seen the effects of weak leadership with the cancellation by Mirvac of a $1 billion project, which has cost a lot of investment and jobs already. You can imagine, Mr Speaker, that if ever we had the same weak leadership in the federal government, investment and jobs would be driven out of this country at a record rate.For example, on another issue, there is the ACTU's claim currently before the Industrial Relations Commission. A couple of years ago the shadow minister thought the safety net review case was a matter of such importance that he actually turned up on behalf of the Labor Party and presented a point of view. This year, when asked what is Labor's position on the 24 per cent, they do not have a position. Why don't they have a position? It is because the Leader of the Opposition does not have what it takes to stand up to some of these union leaders - to stand up for the workers and for a system that will keep inflation and interest rates at a reasonable level. - Mr Speaker, when the unions say to the Leader of the Opposition, `We do not want any individual contracts' -  - he says, `Whatever you want.' When the unions say, `We only represent one in five but we do not want non-union agreements, he says, `You are the union leaders - whatever you want.' When the union leaders say -  - The ACTU, in Greg Combet's document, which he put out when he became the ACTU secretary, said, `One of the proudest boasts of this country in recent years has been the improvement in real wages for people on low incomes.' - It has been since 1996 as a result of our reforms. When you have weak leadership, you have record unemployment, declining real wages and the sort of roll-back, roll-over policy that we have from this man. In the end, the people who pay for this are the people who are unemployed and the small businesses that make this economy as good as it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I can advise him that today, with the Commissioner for Taxation, I announced a simplified accounting method for people in the food industry. This will be of great assistance for small business, in particular in the food industry, in compliance with GST. Mr Speaker, you will recall that, when the government announced its tax policy, its determination was to have as few exemptions as possible from goods and services tax so as to minimise compliance costs. One of the things about goods and services tax is that the more exemptions you have, the more complex it becomes. In the Senate the government was defeated on its legislation because of Labor intransigence and was forced to compromise with the exemption of food, which would have led to a great deal of complexity in the food retailing industry as people in the food industry would have to distinguish between those items that had GST on them and those which were GST free. As a consequence of that exemption and the complexity which came with it, the government asked the Commissioner of Taxation to look at simplification, and I can announce today that we have a system which has dramatically simplified compliance costs in the food industry. -   - And it requires no change to the legislation. So isn't that a wonderful thing. We made sure that in the legislation there was provision for the guidelines to be put out so that this could be done. May I say this simplification is of course being opposed by the Australian Labor Party, so opposed to GST it wants to keep it and every item of simplification! - The old cocky on the front bench there, the cockatoo with his white frill and his shrill voice - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - interjects. - Mr Speaker, can I say what this allows to be done. For example, if you have a hot bread shop, you can adopt a general rule which says that 50 per cent of your sales attract GST and 50 per cent do not. You do not have to itemise between which items GST applies to and which it does not. You can just say at the end of the quarter, `Well, we had so much in sales; 50 per cent is taxable and 50 per cent is not.' If you happen to have a convenience store that does not have takeaway food, you can adopt the business norm approach and just apply GST to 30 per cent of your sales with no need to itemise. There are also other alternatives for small businesses in the food industry. They can do a snapshot of their sales if that will help them more or they can do a stock purchases method. This is dramatic simplification for the food industry. It is done under the legislation which the government put through the House and the Senate. It will be warmly welcomed by small business in food retailing and it is part of simplifying compliance costs for the new tax system which will get Australia into the 21st century. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. We have seen in recent years a very strong contribution by small business to the Australian economy. That has obvious implications right across the economy, particularly as we have seen small business provide many of the 600,000 jobs that have been created since March 1996. The small business community has provided the bulk of those jobs. The question specifically asked was about the contribution of women to small business. It is very encouraging to see more and more women going into small business, setting up their own enterprises, employing other Australians, investing and building living standards. In fact, we have seen a greater growth of women in business than of men in business in the last few years.Women have been particularly prominent as employers in education, health and community services, accommodation, food, retail, cultural and personal service industries. They are also expanding into what have been perhaps more male domains, such as manufacturing. It is good to encourage women into all of these sectors as they are obviously making a strong contribution. They have certainly been innovative and are playing a more important role in driving employment and in growing industry.The government has a part to play in this. We have been addressing a number of policies to try to improve the environment in which these businesses will be given the opportunity to grow and to prosper. Obviously some of the big ticket items - tax, employment and workplace relations policies - are important, but we have also been busy with things which do not get a lot of public focus, like the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program, but are very practical measures to assist people in business, and in particular with some focus on women in business. The latest program, the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program, will receive $6.4 million over three years. It specifically helps to develop and enhance the business skills of female small business owners and managers by increasing access to skills development, mentoring and information services. For example, I know of one in Far North Queensland that is skilling women in business in the Cook Shire Council. The local member tells me that it has been very well received. It is not a lot of money - $30,000 - but it has been directed specifically to help build skills in that area of regional Australia.To conclude, I think there is a risk to this effort because, if you are running a small business, a lot of people in small business do not take a lot of dollars out for their recurrent expenses. A lot of people in small business put money back into the business because that is their nest egg for the future, and it is growing a business which is terribly important for creating jobs and for creating wealth. One of the greatest disincentives for growing a business has been the capital gains tax system. One of the things this government is determined to do for women and men in small business is to reduce the capital gains tax burden on them. Why work your guts out if, in the end, when you have finished running that business, the tax man says, `Thank you for building a business. Now I want to take half of what you've earned.' That is why we are so opposed to the Labor Party's plan to increase income tax, because that also means an increase in capital gains tax.The consequence of that would be that, instead of having women out there building businesses, we would have a tax policy from the Labor Party that says, `If you give somebody a job, we in the Labor Party are going to penalise you for building job opportunities.' This is madness. We have a policy directed to helping the creation of jobs, and yet the Labor Party is committed to destroying incentive in the small business community. It just goes to show, when it comes to creating jobs and helping small business, we are for it and they are out there to crush incentive and innovation in one of the dynamic parts of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I have seen that the Labor Party has recently announced its support for basic skills tests - ironically, on the very day that the New South Wales Teachers Federation forced the abandonment of the year 7 skills test in that state. So it gives us a chance to see just what the Labor Party's support for the basic skills test adds up to. What did the Labor Party say? Did it call for the reinstatement of the test? Did it attack the union and say that it had to reverse its position? No. The Labor Party's support for the basic skills test survives just so long as the union agrees, not one jot further.This became very clear on radio 2BL yesterday, when the shadow minister was asked what his support for the tests added up to. His reply said it all. I will quote the question the interviewer asked:He [John Aquilina] actually said he thought the Federation was too hard line. It was far too left wing and ideological. Would you share those views?That is a very tricky question for a member of the opposition, because if you are not very careful you might end up criticising the union. But I do not think it will surprise anyone here to know that the member for Dobell was up to the challenge. He avoided that. His answer was:Well, I really think that is up to John Aquilina, and in many ways it's up to the membership of the Teachers Federation.He then went on to say:I don't have as much to do with the New South Wales Teachers Federation as I had to do with the National Parent Organisations and Sharan Burrow, through the Australian Education Union.He went on further to say:I have regular discussions with Sharan ... and. my discussions with Sharan ... are usually constructive. - Thank you. The shadow minister said:My discussions with Sharan are regular, I have regular discussions with her and my discussions are usually constructive.You can almost hear him before the speech on Monday night, ringing up Sharan Burrow to find out if the speech was going to be okay:Hello, Shazza, I've got a bit of a problem here. I've got to say something about basic skills. - He said to Sharan Burrow:Shazza, I've got a problem here. I've got to make out that I am really supportive of basic skills testing but I don't want to -  - The shadow minister, the member for Dobell, clearly had a problem because he wanted to give the impression that he was supportive of the basic skills test but he did not want to criticise the union. So, he is obviously asking the union what he can say and how far he can go. He finally comes out with the major criticism of the union: that it is not `progressive' to do these kinds of things. It is not progressive to totally prohibit basic skills tests for year 7 students in New South Wales. Can you imagine a weaker, lamer response? That is what the Labor Party offers whenever the union stands in the way of implementing a positive education policy.The basic skills test was first introduced in Australia in 1989. The Labor Party has just committed itself to it. It is 10 years behind and it is no wonder that the member for Werriwa said, regarding a conversation with Kim Beazley in 1996:Kim Beazley said to me that Australian Labor was falling 10 years behind comparable parties in our policy development and our ideas. Now, that was the case then. We've probably got as much ground to make up now.We have here a shadow minister who is not prepared to stand up even for a policy that is 10 years out of date. He is not prepared to stand up to the unions, not prepared to stand up for parents and not prepared to stand up for disadvantaged students in New South Wales. He is so incompetent that he cannot even get the educational goals of the Leader of the Opposition straight. You cannot wholly blame him for that because the Leader of the Opposition has trouble getting them straight. He could not get these goals straight yesterday. He has not corrected himself. The Labor Party is in total confusion on its education policies. The Leader of the Opposition is demonstrating once again that he is not prepared to take action against an incompetent, weak education shadow minister. That is because he is incompetent and weak himself.</DOC>

 - If the member who asked the question had remained for the MPI yesterday, he would have seen that I outlined entirely the action that had been taken with regard to Riverside. Indeed, the report of 3 November was the report that said that the home had come back up to standard. With regard to the incident that occurred in January, and about which I heard in February, I acted speedily and I acted with a resolve that we were going to take action. I would remind the honourable member that it is the department that makes that decision. It is a bit like the DPP, if you like. It is not a political decision made by the Attorney-General as to whether a prosecution should be made. It is made by the department so that it can be appraised in an unpolitical manner. The decision was taken by the department that that action should be taken.Can I now tell you that today all the residents have moved to St Vincent's. This morning they had a morning tea where comments like this came out: `We didn't know what quality care was', `Oh, orange juice?', and `There is actually enough fresh fruit for all of us?' In other words, there were people in that home who had never experienced quality care and who are now saying that they realise how bad it was previously. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because he is concerned about good care being given instead of political point-scoring. If I may make it very plain, the accreditation system is designed to have a comprehensive and targeted system of visits. Since its inception 18 months ago it has conducted 1,250 visits, which have included 827 support visits. There have been close to 400 accreditation site visits, and there have been 1,500 residential classification scale visits which have reviewed 14,000 care plans. There have been six spot visits by the agency, which has to determine when it is necessary to use that tool. The accreditation system is designed to bring poor standard homes up to standard and to let them give good care, and it has been very successful. In Victoria alone, we have seen 35 homes which could not reach certification standards - that is the buildings. I would remind the opposition that they commissioned the Gregory report and then did nothing about it. It was we who followed the Gregory report and put in place the accommodation charge, which will give $1.4 billion over 10 years for upgrading of buildings. There is something like $800 million worth of work already under way, but there were 35 homes in Victoria alone which simply were not going to get up to standard. They have gone out of business and that means we are seeing new players come in to give good care. </DOC>

The fact of the matter is that we have a complaints resolution scheme, and there was a complaint made. The advice to me was that there had been a complaint made about this home and that it had been resolved satisfactorily on 18 January. I was asked yesterday whether or not I had had a call to my office. I went back to my office and checked, and in fact Mrs Bohm telephoned the office on 28 February. It was referred by my office to the department and from the department to the agency. The department tells me they also had a call from Mrs Bohm on the 27th. In addition to that, today I have had a further complaint which was conveyed to me by the member for Hinkler. I have referred that also to the agency and asked that they take immediate action.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This is an issue which is obviously of particular importance in Victoria, but I think it does have broader implications. I suppose, in a nutshell, it is a classic example of where you have a weak state Labor leader unable to deal with the very unions that put him into the premiership in the first place. A statement has been made by the Master Builders Association, this morning, that they intend to take further industrial action over the next three months on a week by week review basis, which represents an escalation of this dispute. This dispute is centred around a claim by the unions for a 24 per cent wage increase, as well as a reduction in hours. Unlike the building industry in other states where other state leaders take a firmer line - those other states having taken 15 per cent over three years but with no reduction in hours - in Victoria not only do they want a 24 per cent increase but they want to work less for it. In the last week or so, however, we have seen some attempt by the parties to resolve the issue, and some discussions have transpired. Whilst that was welcome, we are now advised from the comments of the builders in Victoria that, whilst there was a semi-cooling-off period, in fact the CFMEU had doubled their work bans on a number of major building sites. Furthermore, they were picking on individual employers and subcontractors for intimidation and standover tactics, leading to the decision taken by the employers today.It is unfortunate that we now see this industry in the state of turmoil that it is. The consequence of this is that we have already seen projects in Victoria lost, abandoned or deferred - thereby costing jobs and investment. For Victorians, it is reminiscent of the days when we had a Labor government again and the BLF were running rampant. It is reminiscent of the days when we had a weak state Labor leader in Victoria and the tram tracks in Bourke Street were full from one end to the other because Labor governments cannot deal with their mates in the trade union movement. The fact of the matter is that we have this problem in one state. It is the same federal law Australia-wide, but it happens to be in only one state where we have a problem. It has been a particular problem since the election of a state Labor government which has not been prepared to stand up to the unions.Sadly, what is happening in Victoria is exactly what you would get if ever the Leader of the Opposition were in a position of greater responsibility. Because, as we know, when it comes to workplace relations policy, the unions have been saying, `We want the individual agreements,' and he says, `Yes, if that's what you want, you can have it.' The unions say, `We want greater rights of entry.' And what does a weak Labor leader do? He says, `Anything you ask for, you get.' When the unions say, `We want to abolish non-union agreements,' what does a weak Labor leader and his former trade union shadow minister say? `Anything the unions want, particularly the abolition of non-union agreements, they get.' The Leader of the Opposition ought to be able to stand up and say that he is opposed to a 36-hour week. He ought to be able to say it. And why doesn't he? Because he does not have what it takes to stand up to the unions who fund his campaign and who preselect most of the people who sit behind him. Half your frontbench are former trade union officials. You have got a former ACTU president directly behind you, there is your deputy and there is another former official further along. The fact is that you cannot do anything in the national interest because you are hand-tied to the union leadership. The people who pay the penalty for this are the rank and file workers who otherwise would like to be able to have an agreement with their employer, but who find themselves in a situation which is run by the CFMEU, with a blind eye turned by a weak state leader - in this case, Mr Bracks. This is an ominous sign of what you get when you have a weak leader like Mr Bracks. It is exactly what you would get if you were ever to have a weak federal leader running the Labor Party in the federal parliament, and the people who suffer are the ordinary people whose jobs are put at risk. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. As the honourable member for Grey knows, as he represents a large number of farmers in an area where it has been particularly difficult over recent times, farmers are largely price takers. They cannot influence the world prices that they receive for their products and, therefore, it is very important for them to have the lowest possible cost structure. That is why the government's new tax system, which delivers a billion dollars worth of savings to farmers, is of such importance to rural Australia.I am aware that there is an alternative policy around. I am told that it has the title `roll-back', but that largely the book is empty. We do not know anything about what is in this policy. We just know that it is called roll-back. It is important for those who are proposing roll-back to tell us whether roll-back intends to roll back the savings to farmers that will be achieved under the new tax system. For instance, the grain industry can expect to gain about $30 million every season from the abolition of excise on the diesel fuel used in the freighting of their grain by train. Are they going to wind that back under their new policy, or are they going to roll back the cuts in income tax that will mean that around three-quarters of all Australian farmers will pay no more than 17 cents in the dollar? Is that what Labor are going to roll back under their new policy? Or are they going to roll back the increases in the tax-free threshold which will benefit all low income Australians?There are a number of women in agriculture who are in Canberra today to commemorate the outstanding achievements of women in agriculture. Awards will be presented this evening in recognition of the tremendous role that women play in supporting farm businesses and in keeping the rural infrastructure alive and well. Women involved in farm businesses have been very strong advocates of rural families and the need to do more to support families who are bringing up their children in a country environment. One of the remarkable things that will happen under the new tax system is that rural families will benefit from the abolition of the assets test on the family allowance. Farmers have long been critics of assets testing. Here is an example of an assets test not just being rolled back but being abolished lock, stock, and barrel. What is Labor going to do about that? What is the honourable member for Capricornia going to say to the rural women of Capricornia or the farmers in Longreach when she stands under the tree of knowledge at Barcaldine and explains roll-back? Is she going to roll back the abolition of the assets test? Labor will put that sort of thing at risk. Is she going to roll back the income tax cuts, the diesel fuel reductions, the research and development? What is Labor going to roll back? It is time there were some answers to these questions. The Labor Party has not ruled out any of these options in its roll-back package and it is time that country people got some answers if the Labor Party expects any kind of sympathy and understanding for its proposal. Labor is all about tax increases. No-one believes there will be any roll-back when it comes to taxes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. It reflects his significant interest in his own electorate as a regional centre in Australia and in some of the initiatives that the government has put in place to assist people in settling outside of our major cities in New South Wales and Victoria. Some of the measures that the government has put in place include the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, which enables regional certifying bodies to assist employers to sponsor skilled migrants - the number of certifying bodies has increased significantly from seven in May 1996 to 29 now - the state and territory nominated independent visa class, which enables state and territory governments to nominate individual migrants on the basis of state specific labour market shortages; the establishment of a database of potential skilled migrants, which is available to state and territory governments and some regional certifying bodies to select migrants; and a skilled regional sponsorship visa which allows people living in designated areas to sponsor relatives who can come without the need for the applicant to meet the points test applicable to the Australian skilled category.The fact is that these measures have been significant. They have led to a situation where, over the last three years, the number of visas granted under the various mechanisms has increased from 1,060 in our first year in office - that is, 1996-97 - to 2,775 last year. If honourable members opposite were seriously interested in regional migration rather than rhetoric, you would hear them talking about the substantial measures that they had in mind that might be able to be considered. You would hear them talking about their record when they were in office to demonstrate that they had a commitment to this process of getting a better dispersal of the migration program. You would hear them saying, in relation to their state colleagues when specific measures are put in place, that they have taken them up and used them. I asked for some advice today just to remind me of what the Labor Party did when they were in office. They provided a mere five points bonus under the concessional family category, which had very little impact. The RSMS scheme was introduced by the former minister as a pilot. He made it very clear that he had put it in the too-hard basket and had no perception that it was likely to work. The only state sponsorship arrangements were in the business skills area, where state sponsorship was used only to bring people to the larger cities and capital cities of the larger states. The RSMS scheme was introduced by the former minister as a pilot. He made it very clear that he had put it in the too hard basket and had no perception that it was likely to work. The only state sponsorship arrangements were in the business skills area, where state sponsorship was only used to bring people to the larger cities and capital cities of the larger states. So the Labor Party in office have demonstrated that they had absolutely no commitment to regional migration, that they had no ideas. In relation to the state sponsorship the only state of Australia that has put the time and effort into developing this initiative so that it works effectively has been South Australia. When you go to those states that mouth some concerns about these matters, like Tasmania, where they have a Labor government in place, there is absolutely no interest at all in taking up these initiatives, even though they have members in this place coming in here and saying: `We are concerned about regional migration.' You ought to be talking to your colleagues. You ought to be sitting down and thinking about some real initiatives that would demonstrate some concern about these issues and producing some substantial ideas.</DOC>

 - I point out the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition. Here he is out of one side of his mouth saying, `Why didn't you close the home?' and then out of the other side of his mouth criticising me for so doing. It is one of those things where you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. If the Leader of the Opposition had paid attention to the matter of public importance yesterday, he would have seen that I put the record of that home, going back to 1988, during which time the ministers Staples, Howe and Lawrence, as the ministers responsible, did nothing about this home at all. Furthermore, I went back through the record to find just how many homes you had closed in 13 years and I found it was one - in 1991. I found that the number of spot checks that was used under your government was very few over 10 years. There is a concern here that was rectified under this system. When I found out about this matter, decisive and swift action was taken. Indeed, I am very pleased to tell you that the welfare of the residents is now being properly looked after and they are looking forward to enjoying the rest of their time in residential aged care. </DOC>

The Federal Court found that -  - The Federal Court found that advisers in the offices of former Prime Minister Keating and the then minister for health, the member for Fremantle herself, had committed Commonwealth taxpayers to pay the cost of her lawyers -  - The Treasurer will note that it is not just by tax increases that Labor seeks to slug the Australian taxpayers. Members are of course aware that a fund was created for the purpose of paying those costs. The government believes that it may have as much as $100,000 left in it. The trustees were Joan Kirner, Gary Gray and John Della Bosca. I wrote to Mr Gray on 23 February requesting that the funds -  - As I said, I wrote to Gary Gray on 23 February suggesting the money be paid over to reduce the taxpayers' obligation to pay the costs. I have not received a reply. But I have learned today through the media that the ALP and the trustees are refusing to hand over any money to pay for what work -  - The newspaper report to which I referred suggested that Labor was apparently endeavouring to get the original donors to agree to use of the money for other purposes. - The Labor Party has before it a proper purpose for the use of those funds. Gary Gray and Labor should pay up, not impose on Australia - </DOC>

 - The first thing I would like to say is that there is no crisis in aged care in general. I must say it because I must support those good people who give good care and look after people very well. And I have got to say this is more than around 98 to 99 per cent of those people who are in the business. I find it deplorable that you want to besmirch them. As Leader of the Opposition, you ought to know better. - Furthermore, there is an obligation to make it known that people in the private sector and the religious and charitable sector find the sort of attack that you are making on them quite unacceptable. The besmirching of their good name by calling it, in your terms, a `crisis' does precisely what I said it does. We have a problem which we are dealing with - and dealing with decisively and effectively. And there is one more thing I would like to say: where is the Labor Party's aged care policy? Is it like your tax policy? And are you going to roll back accreditation?  -   - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Commonwealth has long funded a number of rural programs. More recently we have funded these under the public health outcome funding agreements such as programs for breasts, cervical cancer screening, alternative birthing services and programs related to genital mutilation. In recent times we have funded a number of new programs that are of particular benefit to women living in rural Australia. Last week I was in Derby with the member for Kalgoorlie launching a visiting female general practitioner program for rural communities. This idea first came up about two years ago at a breakfast I was at, with the now Deputy Prime Minister, for women in agriculture. One thing that was put to me very strongly was that, in many rural communities, females never have the chance to consult a female general practitioner. This can be particularly difficult when there are sensitive personal issues or health issues. In response to this concern, we are funding a visiting scheme to 150 rural communities around Australia, mostly in what the Bureau of Statistics calls RAMA 3 to 5, but also some in RAMA 6 to 7. We are auspicing it under the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and it will for the very first time give a very large number of women in rural Australia access to a female GP from time to time.Two weeks ago I was in Mackay with the member for Dawson and met a local surgeon, Peter Donnelly, who told me of research that showed that, if a woman delays seeking treatment for breast cancer for three to six months, it actually increases the risk of death from that breast cancer by 10 per cent. One of the problems that rural women have with breast cancer is in getting all the specialists together in one spot. This is something that is taken for granted in city teaching hospitals, where there are multidisciplinary teams. I was launching a trial there that we are running in three locations around Australia. One is in Mackay, the second is in western Victoria and the third is in central New South Wales. We are trying to do two things. First, we are seeing how we can best give country women with breast cancer the full range of services that people in the city would expect - counselling, reconstruction and a whole range of treatment options; and, secondly, we are using technology to put together all the specialists in a virtual manner so that we can actually save time in initiating treatment. I am very optimistic about these trials.The government has also funded the Jean Hailes Foundation in Melbourne, which focuses on research, particularly on menopause. This funding has enabled them to start an outreach service into rural Australia for the first time. Recently they held a women's health forum in Broken Hill, where 300 women attended, and they were able to provide intensive training for 30 local health professionals on the latest research and treatment concerning women's health issues.Finally, on behalf of the government, I would like to acknowledge the enthusiastic participation of women from rural Australia to the regional Australian summit, convened by the Deputy Prime Minister last year. In the health services area, for example, the women involved made a very significant contribution to its overall success.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the paramount issue in relation to telecommunications in rural and regional Australia is unquestionably the delivery of the best possible technology, the best possible access, the greatest possible reliability and the lowest possible prices. Those are the really critical issues for jobs and prosperity in rural and regional Australia. The ALP's approach to rolling back everything is, presumably, because they would like to take us back to the days when government instrumentalities were treated as employment agencies and any suggestion that there ought to be firmly set standards, and that the pursuit of those standards should be closely monitored, was never taken seriously and nothing was ever done about it. I would certainly say that it is very important for Telstra to consider carefully the impact of its changes on employment, both for the sake of individuals and for communities in regional areas. For example, many of the positions that will go, we are told, will be contracted out. That actually can help to not only preserve jobs but to create jobs and small business opportunities in regional Australia.  - I hear the Leader of the Opposition saying, `It hasn't so far.' As a matter of fact, I think you will find later in the day that that is not true. Having said that, let me again spell out this point: the number one objective in this area has to be the delivery of service and technology at levels which will maximise, firstly, the competitiveness of existing businesses and social life in rural areas and, secondly, the delivery of world class technologies which will facilitate new investment and new jobs in regional areas. The future for our regions will be secure to the extent upon which they have access to those new technologies - exploding technology, as it is largely. There is no doubt that that is what we have to have in regional areas. Labor's hypocrisy in this area knows absolutely no bounds. The member for Batman says that they will give a voice back to the bush because they care for Telstra and Australia Post. But they have form - 270 post offices disappeared while they were in power. They wound back the analog phone network, and they actually obliged us to get rid of a service that was working well. They tried to dictate technology. They did nothing about standards; it was us who put the customer guarantee standards in place - not them. It was us who attached fines to it for non-performance. Indeed, it was us who sought to put in place such valuable mechanisms as Networking the Nation; they attempted to prevent us from rolling it out. Our policy position here is well known. Our priority is clearly ensuring not that standards are allowed to remain static, let alone fall back, but that we improve the roll-out of services, capabilities and technologies to the advantage of the bush.</DOC>

 - I can only describe today's labour force figures as magnificent news for job seekers in this country. We have seen the figure fall to an unemployment level of 6.7 per cent, and that is the lowest level of unemployment since June 1990. The unemployment rate has been trending down since the beginning of 1997 and the trend rate has been at or below seven per cent for the last five months.There were 59,100 new jobs created in February. Of those, 34,000 were full-time jobs and 25,100 were part-time jobs. In the past year, more than a quarter of a million new jobs have been created, and since this government came to power in March 1996, just four years ago, a total of 653,800 jobs have been created in this country. Of all of the government's economic achievements, there is none of which we are prouder than the fact that we have generated jobs for 653,800 Australians. Added to that, we have seen to it that the entire Australian work force is better off now in real terms than it was at any time during the 13 years of the former government. Not only have we generated more jobs, not only have we cut their monthly mortgage bill by an average of $266 a month, but we have also done something that the trade union bosses of the Labor Party could never do, and that is to increase the real incomes of Australian workers. In the time that we have been in office, because we have followed policies that have induced higher levels of productivity in Australia, we now are presiding over a situation where the real incomes of workers are rising because the nominal increase in their wages is running ahead of the rate of inflation. But, because the rate of inflation is low and because that boost in wages is coming off productivity increases, it is sustainable and it is not going to be undermined.  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. I remind him that only yesterday some more figures came out about the growth in wages which show how sustainable is this growth in real income. Australian workers have not enjoyed a situation like this before. They have not enjoyed it before because whenever they got an increase in wages in earlier years it was often accompanied by low productivity, it was unsustainable, it led to an increase in inflation and inevitably tight monetary policy was applied in order to squeeze inflation out of the system. That has not happened over the last four years. In fact, interest rates now are dramatically lower than they were four years ago. As a result, every household on average is $266 a month better off. So you have the marvellous aggregation of good economic fortune: you have 653,000 more jobs, you have low inflation, you have higher real incomes and you have lower interest rates - and all of that means that there are more Australians in work and those Australians in work have more money to spend. That is underwriting the strength of Australia's economy at the present time.I am invited by the member for Macquarie to turn my attention to the alternatives. Let me say that my answer is coming speedily to a conclusion because there is indeed no alternative to which one can turn one's attention. In the four years that have gone by since the member for Brand became the Leader of the Opposition, he has not generated one serious policy alternative. He does not have an economic policy and he does not have an employment policy. All he has is a policy to nitpick, to be negative, to be obstructive, to criticise, to nark and to complain about the policy initiatives of the government. I believe that the work force of Australia has every reason to be optimistic about this country's economic future. We are a strong economy and we are a low inflation economy. The economy is presided over by a government which has the courage to bring about economic reforms. We are delivering historic reforms in the Australian taxation system but, most importantly, we are delivering jobs for Australian men and women and we are ensuring that those Australians in work have rising real incomes and lower interest obligations, and therefore the family spending power is better off all round than it has been for many years in this country.</DOC>

In fact, I had several conversations with the Chairman and I had an extended conversation with both the Chairman and the Managing Director. Those conversations occurred yesterday morning. I was aware of the general terms of the announcement that was to be made in Melbourne by Mr Mansfield. Let me inform the House - I am very happy to do so, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me the opportunity of doing so - that I took the opportunity of what I can only describe as a very direct conversation with both of those gentlemen to make a number of things clear. The first thing I made clear was that the determination of the government to ensure that service provision in the bush by Telstra continued to improve was absolutely unabated.  -  - Those on the front bench of the opposition interject in relation to that statement. In a moment, I will come to a statement made by the shadow minister for communications on 20 December 1999. Yesterday, I made it very clear to the managing director and to the chairman that the government was absolutely committed and that there was an absolute obligation on Telstra to ensure that there was no deterioration of services in regional Australia - indeed, that the value of those services had to increase. I make it very plain to the parliament and to people in regional Australia that although there has been a measurable improvement in services delivered by Telstra in Australian rural areas, there is still considerable room for improvement. I also remind the House that, in the weeks and months immediately ahead of us, the value of the social bonus flowing from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra shares will begin to flow into rural areas of Australia. As that money flows, I will remind the people of the Australian bush that the Labor Party voted against that money. I will remind the people of country Australia that at every stage the Australian Labor Party sought to deny us the financial capacity to put more communications services into the Australian bush.Telstra is a company that has certain commercial obligations. The proposition that the government should seek to micromanage the employment levels of Telstra is not a proposition that I assert. And it was not a proposition that somebody on the other side of the parliament asserted when he had responsibility in this area. If ever there has been a piece of political humbug over the last 24 hours it is the concern expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Perth about proposed redundancies and downsizing of staff employed by Telstra. I remind the parliament that between September 1991 and June 1994 the total number of staff employed by Telstra fell by 17,610. That was very understandable because the principle underlying the operation of Telstra was laid down on many occasions. In particular, it was laid down in an answer furnished to the House on 22 August 1991 by the then Minister for Transport and Communications - and the Leader of the Opposition will know who that was. The answer, in the name of Mr Beazley, said:Telecom - as it was then called - will become a wholly-owned Government company, and will be merged with OTC once the details of the capital structure and interconnection arrangements are finalised. Interestingly enough, the answer then goes on to say: Telecom has continued to review its management structure and operational methods to ensure that it is most appropriately placed to face competition.I had no argument with that, and you should not have any argument with the proposition now either. It then goes on to say:Restructuring of Telecom's workforce will result from this process.Of course there was restructuring. There were retrenchments - 17,610 retrenchments. He then went on to say:Employment opportunities will be created with the second telecommunications carrier.The spokesman for the then government was saying that there would be fewer staff employed by Telstra. I want everybody in the House to note that this was at a time when Telstra was owned 100 per cent by the government. This proposition that in some way, if you have less government ownership, you will have more employees is completely wrong. The reason why there are rearrangements of the staff of Telstra is that that company, as foreshadowed by none other than Kim Beazley, has to compete in the marketplace. In the process of competing in the marketplace, we are going to see to it that it delivers its obligations to the rural and regional areas of Australia. We are not going to try to micromanage the employment levels any more than Mr Beazley tried to do that when he was in government. It is an absurd proposition and will end up trashing the share price of the company. We have to get a little bit of commercial realism into this. The Leader of the Opposition was speaking the truth when he was in government. He is now behaving like an opportunistic humbug in opposition. That is what he is doing now and it is about time he was called for what he is on this subject. As his answer in August 1991 indicated, the Leader of the Opposition knows that there are alternative employment opportunities in the telecommunications area like no other section of the Australian economy. I have been informed that of those who have been made redundant by Telstra, something in the order of 88 per cent have been able to obtain alternative employment. Nobody welcomes the downsizing of any work force, but I remind the House that I have just drawn attention to the best employment figures for more than a decade. I remind the parliament that the alternative employment opportunities in the communications area are better than in any other section of the Australian economy. That is the truth. The Leader of the Opposition faced that truth when he was a minister in the former government, almost 10 years ago. That is why, when Telstra shed 17,000 staff under the stewardship of the Keating government, he defended those decisions on the grounds that it was the inevitable consequence of Telstra operating in the marketplace. You did not hear him complaining then. You did not hear of any of these characters getting up at caucus meetings and saying, `Why is this happening?' In fact, you had attacks made by members of the Keating government on leaders of the telecommunication unions for opposing the restructuring that went on at that particular time. In doing that, the Leader of the Opposition, as a minister in the former government, was behaving with a modicum of realism and commonsense, but what he is doing today is engaging in the cheapest form of political opportunism imaginable.The Leader of the Opposition is trashing any credentials he has to any sense of economic commonsense or economic responsibility. It is the fact that when he was in government he argued that fewer employees did not mean lower service. That was the justification he would use whenever the unions criticised the fact that the government was allowing the corporatisation of Telstra. Let me say on behalf of the government, as I said to both Mr Mansfield and Dr Switkowski yesterday, we are determined that the obligations openly given by Telstra in relation to the Australian bush will be maintained. It is an obligation of Telstra's to do that. There are legislative obligations imposed on that carrier, and I have every reason to believe that those obligations will be delivered on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can report to the House that the International Monetary Fund has just released a report on Australia saying:In recent years productivity growth in Australia has increased to rates not seen since the golden age of the 1960s.The IMF goes on to say:Potential output growth in Australia over the next four to six years is likely to fall in the range of 3.2 to 4.3 per cent. The midpoint of this range is significantly higher than previous estimates.The Australian economy, growing at a rate of around four per cent over the last three or four years since the government has been in office, has created approximately 653,000 net new jobs. As a consequence of that, the unemployment rate in this country has fallen since this government came to office from 8.6 to 6.7 per cent. If you were to have four more years of four per cent growth or another net 653,000 jobs, you would be taking that unemployment rate significantly down on its current levels. And the great news today, as the Prime Minister said, is that in the last month there were nearly 60,000 new jobs created in Australia, making a total of 654,000 new jobs since the government was elected. It is that process of economic reform and strong growth which will keep our economy moving.  The IMF has also said that part of keeping our economy moving is the landmark tax reform package which this government is introducing - and that package has been endorsed by the IMF and the OECD. I am asked if there are any other tax packages that are being recommended to the government. There are none being recommended by the IMF or the OECD. There was one recommended, however, by one of those young Labor thinkers - and I use the words `Labor thinkers' with a heavy sense of irony - the member for Werriwa, recently. The member for Werriwa apparently is in favour of a GST, but he thinks that you should have geographic areas which are GST free. So you could cross into a GST-free area and buy your Big Mac GST free and cross out of it and buy your Big Mac with GST on it. This is apparently so much that the Labor member for Griffith was moved to pick up his pen this morning. He said, quite rightly, that one of the problems with the idea of the member for Werriwa was that it was unconstitutional - maybe in third-wave politics you rise above constitutions! - and he wrote this:Latham has written much that is innovative. His most recent tax proposal, however, is just plain loopy.That was the federal member for Griffith on the federal member for Werriwa. The federal member for Griffith also says this:I am unaware of any similar geographically differentiated consumption tax regime operating elsewhere in the OECD.He is quite right. The plan of the member for Werriwa operates nowhere in the OECD. But, if we were worried about the OECD, the wholesale sales tax operates nowhere else in the OECD either - the tax which the Labor Party has consistently been supporting. So we have the member for Werriwa who wants GST-free areas and the member for Griffith who wants the GST without exemptions. Who do you think would take the lowest road in relation to the GST, Mr Speaker? Who do you think would take the lowest road in fear and loathing on the GST? The federal member for Lilley. Now isn't that a surprise! The federal member for Lilley is now issuing in a newspaper this document:Wayne Swan - Federal Member for LilleySpeech to Federal Parliament opposing the GST...     ...      ...It could be repealed today. ... We will support a repeal.So we have got the GST-free geographic areas, we have got the member for Griffith who wants to follow the OECD and we have got the member for Lilley who is supporting a repeal! -   - The member for Werrriwa is going to have GST-free geographic areas, the member for Griffith is going to follow the OECD practice, the member for Lilley is going to support a repeal and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will say whatever it takes, so what do you think the policy of the Leader of the Opposition would be? -  - There it is, Mr Speaker. -   - Like a rolling stone, no direction home - how does it feel?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Prime Minister acknowledged and actually made it quite plain that the benefits from the sale of T2, as it is known - and very substantial benefits they are - will put in place reforms and updates of technology of the sort that you simply never offered the bush. You simply never even thought about offering them and, more than that, when we offered them you sought to oppose them. You stood in the way of them all the time. The Prime Minister openly acknowledged that they are shortly to start flowing - that is the reality. But, in terms of what we committed ourselves to out of T1, we have delivered big time. We really have delivered big time - Networking the Nation is benefiting rural and regional people right across Australia right now. There are a lot of people out there who are very thankful for what that has delivered, and that is not to mention the other things that we have delivered, such as the NHT.When it comes to the question of services, the fact is that under 13 years of Labor Telstra were never required to meet any standards. They were never required to match up to standards. Phones were merely connected; if they broke down, they were fixed in the timetable sort of agreed between Telstra and the customer. We have given the industry watchdog, the ACA, the power, under part 26 of the Telecommunications Act, to actively investigate Telstra's performance against the customer service guarantee. We put that in place and we gave it the teeth, if you like, of fines and sanctions - up to $10 million for non-performance. Labor did not deliver any of that. This newfound concern for jobs in rural and regional Australia is just so patently shallow -  -   - It is so patently newly found, as I hear one of my colleagues behind me say, that it is absolutely laughable and exposes the hypocrisy of their position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. It gives me the opportunity to point to something that I think is very important indeed and that perhaps did not quite get the publicity that it should have. There was some very detailed work undertaken by the very highly respected Centre for Agricultural and Regional Economics at Armidale, in the member for New England's seat, towards the end of last year. As part of this analysis, the effects of the GST were tested against five typical farm enterprise situations. It is very obvious that no-one on the other side is actually interested in the outcomes of tax reform for rural and regional Australia, mainly because it actually delivers real benefits which of course they have always been prepared to stand in the way of.We actually found that the effect in regional communities of tax changes for farm businesses is very encouraging. So often those businesses are of course the underpinning of regional economies. The centre looked at a small grazing operation, a medium sized grazing operation, a cropping partnership, a cropping company and, finally, a horticultural operation. The tremendous news is that in all five cases it found that the introduction of the GST would mean an increase in net disposable income. All five farming systems reviewed are better off, and let me quote the centre:In fact all the analyses we have done at CARE to date have resulted in increased net disposable income under the reform tax package.There is more good news: it is not just the big operators who are better off; the small grazing enterprise was 57 per cent better off in terms of net disposable income, the medium cropping operation was 20 per cent better off, the cropping partnership 16 per cent better off, the cropping company 22 per cent better off and, finally, the largest operation, which was the horticultural outfit, was 13 per cent better off. They are quite stark improvements in disposable incomes for farmers at a time when the sector is seeing very, very low and often negative returns on capital investment. They are in fact very encouraging, very significant figures. It is worth noting that this study involved the use of five actual farms - they were not hypothetical; they were real. The question has to be asked in the face of this - and indeed it was referred to by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry yesterday - about the ALP's empty slate of a policy approach which contains just one commitment, and that is roll-back. Where is Labor's roll-back going to hit the farm sector, so desperately in need of a better bottom line? Where will it be? We know that we are looking at attacks on the income tax rates - the Treasurer has clearly established that - but what of some of the other important benefits, such as the very substantial benefits to the grains industry that the minister for agriculture referred to yesterday? What about the $3.5 billion cuts in fuel excise? We still have not heard from the new spokesman for the regions over there a repudiation of the member for Dixon's claim that our fuel cuts were nothing more than a boost to pollution. We are still waiting, member for Batman, for a repudiation of that statement. We have not had it. The only question that can be asked is: why does Labor in reality hate the bush so much that they are not prepared to commit themselves to the reforms that make a difference.</DOC>

 - I recognise that the member asked these questions in good faith. Some of them raise issues which I am not immediately aware of -  - Well, I am not particularly aware of future plans for a telecentre in Orange, and I think that all members of the House would accept that that is entirely reasonable. I will seek to see whether or not Telstra is in a position to give you any reassurance on that matter. I have to say that we are not in the business - and I do not think it is appropriate for us to be in the business - of micromanaging Telstra's business affairs. Let me make that point. - And the ALP doesn't either! The new found concern for the regions is indeed thin, because it is so new. -  - To come to the issue of CDMA, I understand the member's concern. I think that the roll-out of CDMA, which is a superior technology - and I do believe that, when it is completed, it will offer a level of service that is superior to that which we have had in the past - was badly hampered by the lack of CDMA transmission capacity and the fact that the old analog handsets did not work as well on analog signal as Telstra apparently believed they would. As those analog signal towers, more than half of which were left switched on into this year, are replaced by the new ones, I genuinely believe that you will see the better service that you get from the newer and better technology.  Let me come to the issue of standards. I repeat what I said earlier: the fact is that Labor never made any attempt whatsoever to do anything about setting standards and then monitoring them. That is the first point. They did not tackle this; we did. The second critical point that has to be noted and that is so often overlooked is that the ownership of Telstra is a separate question altogether from the government's capacity to set standards and insist that they be maintained.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his answer today, one of the reasons that we have had much greater success in creating jobs is the fact that we have been prepared to reform the workplace relations system. What that does is turn the key in all of our businesses to better relationships between employers and employees, which is why the level of industrial disputes in Australia has fallen. It also encourages people at work to ask, `What can we do at work to make our business more efficient?' If our businesses are more competitive, they will grow, they will invest and they will create more jobs. Not only do they create more jobs - and we have seen today's very good figures, with 59,000 extra jobs - but people can actually earn more pay. The trade unions put out a document in the middle of last year which said that Australia's proudest boast was that we have increased wages for low income people. We have done that because we have been prepared to give the responsibilities to our businesses, subject to a safety net being in place, particularly small businesses, and they have really gone out there to make a big difference. We have nearly 100,000 Australian workplace agreements now, and they are working. They are helping us to create a better system, which means more jobs, and the unions' policy is to abolish them. That is going to destroy jobs, not create jobs. The non-union agreements have been working. We have nearly 200,000 people covered by those. They work, and they help to improve our businesses. The Labor Party's policy - because the unions say so - is to abolish them. We have moved away from industry-wide bargains to an enterprise focus, something which the Labor Party used to agree with.When you have an industry-wide approach, you get problems like pattern bargaining, which is exactly the problem we have in the building industry in Victoria today, a matter about which the member is long on experience, having himself been an employer in that industry. If you have a lot of pattern bargaining you get more disputes. It is interesting - I have taken out the figures - that the average level of industrial disputes in Australia when the Labor Party was in government and running this industry-wide sector approach was 190 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Under our government, the equivalent figure is fewer than 75 days. That is a lot fewer disputes. The figures show that not only have there been fewer disputes but also they have been shorter disputes because they have been settled locally, between the people in the business.When you look at the circumstances in Victoria, the Labor Party's policy is to go back to the industry-wide approach, which is at the heart of the problem in Victoria. So when there is a solution, an enterprise bargaining solution, they are opposed to it and want to take us back to the days of Norm Gallagher. In the last two weeks there has been a proposal for a cooling-off period in Victoria. When that was half agreed, the unions doubled the work bans. So much for their attitude!  - I think a cooling-off period is a good idea, and I think it might actually help in Victoria. What is interesting is that the Labor Party has opposed cooling-off periods, both in the federal parliament and at the state level. Why? Because all the trade union bosses have to do is ring up weak leaders like Kim Beazley and give him their marching instructions. Lastly, in Victoria the state government is responsible for what happens in this particular industry because it buys a lot of product. It is a big buyer from the building industry. Instead of trying to blame the federal parliament, Steve Bracks ought to, as Mark Birrell, the shadow minister, said today, front up in the commission next week. He has the opportunity to do so. He ought to show some leadership. He ought to stand up to these unions and show them that a 36-hour week is simply not affordable. This is just a classic lesson in Labor Party politics. If you get a weak Labor leader the unions run amok, and that is a very great cost to the taxpayer. That is what is happening in Victoria, and if ever that weak leader gets in here the same problem will occur Australia-wide.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his interest and for his question. He has been at the forefront of development of the government policies in the communications sector that saw through 1999 an increase, by some 12 per cent, in employment with the creation of 17,700 jobs. All of this is being fuelled by government policies that increase competition, that see benefits not just in job creation but also in the lowering of costs to consumers. Look at the drop in price for overseas calls, long-distance calls in Australia, local calls, calls in corporate markets and the like. There has been a reduction in the price of all telephony services. That is because, unlike the opposition, we have moved from the old days of the PMG and Telecom into a new era of telecommunications services in Australia. As of March this year, we have 37 licensed carriers in Australia. That is competition - competition that is of tangible, material and concrete benefit to consumers. Remember that telecommunications does not involve just voice call services. Telecommunications extends to data and Internet access for Australians. There are now over 1,000 Internet service providers. That means that, over the last decade, industry revenue grew from $9 billion to $22 billion in 1999 - so much so that the communications sector contributed $5 billion towards GDP in 1999 whereas in 1993, during Labor's stewardship, it contributed only $2.8 billion.  -  - There are interjections from the opposition. What interests me about this question on telecommunications is that the Telstra announcement about the job reductions - but with corresponding commitments to service improvements, which we will hold by legislative impost, Telstra 2 - was that it was made yesterday morning. Did we get a single question in this House on Telstra or telecommunications yesterday? Was the MPI on telecommunications? Was there a suspension of standing orders on telecommunications? Did any of the Labor members during the adjournment last night mention telecommunications? Worse still, Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, did not receive a single question in the Senate yesterday on Telstra and the issue of job losses. It was only because the leaderless opposition woke up this morning, saw some media interest in the issue and decided that was the issue of the day. Again, a Leader of the Opposition taking his guidance, his lead, if not from the unions overnight, from the media of this morning. While the government has policies that see the telecommunications sector arguably the fastest growing sector of the economy with real benefits to all Australians wherever they live, the opposition is leaderless, is lost and has no policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. Obviously, the member for Makin, with the electorate that she represents, is interested in Australia's automotive exports. I returned on Monday from a business delegation to the Middle East, which contained 60 business leaders from Australia and had been organised by Austrade, through Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. At this juncture, I will encourage all members of the House to visit the Austrade display that is on upstairs to give you an idea of the excellent job they are doing overseas.During the trip to the Middle East we were very impressed with the efforts of Australia's exporters into that part of the world and the very diverse range of exports in which we are increasing our activity in the Middle East - from the food and agribusiness sectors through to services, including health, education, tourism, finance and defence equipment. But, of course, there is very strong growth in the export of manufactured goods, and particularly automotive exports, to the region. Unlike the Labor Party - and particularly the Labor Party led by Paul Keating with his `Asia Only' policy, but I suppose we should acknowledge that he at least had a policy for a short period of time, unlike the current Labor Party that does not seem to have any policies at all - the coalition has established an export base beyond Asia to both the east and to the west into the Middle East region. The success of our policies is reflected across a broad range of exports. The one thing that stood out on our visit to the Middle East was the capacity of the Australian automotive industry to be very competitive in the international marketplace. In the Middle East we saw how popular Australian made left-hand drive Camrys, Commodores and Holden Caprices are. -   - I will come to the Labor Party's efforts in a minute. The Australian built Camry is now the largest selling car in Saudi Arabia. Last year we shipped 23,000 Australian built Camrys to Saudi Arabia alone. While I was in Dubai a deal was struck with the Dubai Transport taxi division to buy 850 new Toyota Camrys. This is along with the 2,000 Camrys that are already in the fleet. These are Australian built motorcars. Passenger vehicles are Australia's fastest growing export to the Middle East - almost 46,000 cars in 1999; $760 million worth of Australian cars into the Middle East. Remember that figure: 46,000 in 1999. What was Labor's record? What did Labor achieve in the last year in government in 1995? How many did they sell? Did they sell 20,000 motor cars? No, they did not. Did they sell 10,000 motor cars? No, they did not. Did they sell a thousand motor cars in 1995 to the Middle East? No. How many did they sell? The answer is one - $14,000 for one motor car in 1995. Compare that to 46,000 motor cars in 1999 under the policy of this government. This government has established a strong and sound operating environment for Australian businesses, and we are going to go on and improve the operating environment under which this automotive industry operates in Australia. What can exporters expect from Labor? They are asking the question now: what is Labor going to do? We have told exporters what we are going to do. We are going to remove $3½ billion worth of costs out of the system that impact on exporters. They are saying: what is Labor going to do under its roll-back policy? Which of those taxes that we are going to remove is Labor going to put back on? Are you going to roll back those tax improvement measures? Are you going to roll back the reduction in the corporate tax rate that this industry receives benefit from? Australia's exporters need an answer from the Labor Party in terms of what it is going to do as far as its policy for the future is concerned.</DOC>

 - What I said precisely yesterday was:I am not a doctor, so I cannot satisfy myself as to the medical condition of each patient. However, because I was sufficiently concerned that there may be matters to investigate, I had the department refer the matter to the Federal Police.In fact, the deputy secretary of the department wrote to the Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Police in the terms that she wanted to discuss `the complaints and findings about Commonwealth funded aged care facilities which may involve criminal conduct in the form of bodily harm to residents. I would appreciate it if you would contact me' - and gives the number - 'or your executive assistant could contact mine'. Following that, the same departmental official forwarded to the Federal Police on the 6th of this month the Riverside report, which contained within it - and what had concerned me -  - Last night the Federal Police brought out a press release saying that they had in fact received that report. The concern of mine in that report was that a dying patient was described as having been bathed in the kerosene bath - that is, a bath containing 30 millilitres of kerosene - and that that person had subsequently died. For me that was sufficient concern. There is a requirement under the Coroners Act. The coroner has been in touch with my office today and asked that a copy of the report be forwarded to the coroner. I referred that letter to the department. The department then sent it on to the coroner. I might say that, under the Coroners Act of Victoria, there is a requirement for doctors who are present at or after a death to refer cases to appropriate authorities, including the coroner, where they believe it is a reportable death, which is then defined. In other words, what I said to you yesterday, and I would quote to you very simply from the Macquarie Dictionary what a reference is, if you like - or you could look it up for yourself - 'to direct the attention or thoughts of; to direct for information or anything required; to hand over or submit for information; considers'. The bottom line was that I was concerned; the contact was made; the report was sent across on 6 March.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and for his support for Work for the Dole, which is one of the signature programs of the Howard government and one of its great and lasting contributions to rebuilding the civic culture of our country. For long-term unemployed people, one of the best things you can do is to give them a useful task. One of the worst things you can do is to just give them a handout. Passive welfare is cruelty masquerading as compassion; it is the kindness that kills. As Noel Pearson has pointed out repeatedly, passive welfare is the poison that destroys communities, and Work for the Dole is really an extension to broader society of a concept which has been helping indigenous communities around our country for more than 20 years. As a society, it is high time that we became absolutely determined to end the cycle of alienation and despair which usually accompanies life on benefits for people who are capable of work. We need a determination that no-one should go on Newstart and disappear into the system to emerge years later as just another welfare statistic. This government is determined to be constantly engaged with job seekers - preferably to get them real work but, if not, to give them something useful to do. It is true that Work for the Dole is a no-frills program, but it is a first step towards empowering people to regain control over their lives; it is a step towards restoring the social contract between society and job seekers, and towards reassuring Australians that all of us have a contribution to make. In just over two years, 57,000 young Australians have participated and 1,500 or more projects have commenced. Late last year the government decided to establish an achievement award for participants and projects. We received 90 nominations for projects and 65 nominations for participants. I am delighted to say that the three finalists - Helen Warr of Hay, Joe Rickard of Darwin and Troy Bryant of Gosford - are in the gallery today. You, may I say, represent the commitment and the civic idealism of the 57,000 young Australians who have participated. The Prime Minister will be announcing the winner at a dinner tonight.Over the last couple of years Work for the Dole has been described by some members opposite as shoddy, as mickey mouse and as evil. I think it is time to put that kind of point scoring behind us as the former employment spokesman was trying to do. Bipartisan support for this program might be too much to expect, but surely we should have bipartisan support for the great organisations and the young Australians who are participating in the program and making the most of their opportunities. I would like to place on record today our appreciation of participants' work, and I would like to thank them for renewing Australians' pride in our young people and for restoring our confidence in society's ability to find a place for everyone. I ask all members to show our appreciation of the three finalists in the usual way.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I have said in this place before that I am not a medical person. It is not proper that all deaths be referred to me, any more than the minister for health is responsible for deaths in a hospital. The normal course of action is, where residential care staff or a family member believe a resident may have died in unusual circumstances, these situations are routinely referred to the relevant state or territory coroner. These referrals are handled by the staff of the aged care facility or the hospital where the death occurred. There are also, as I mentioned before, obligations on doctors who are present at or after the death to refer cases to appropriate authorities, including the coroner - and I refer you to the coroners act.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question, and I note the very considerable interest that the member for Petrie has in the need for a non-discriminatory and balanced migration program. I think it is important to recognise the way in which the migration program has changed to ensure that it is balanced, and what was the situation that we inherited when we came to office. The fact is that when we came to office the program was dominated by family reunion applicants. Seventy per cent of the places went to family reunion applicants; 30 per cent went to skilled applicants. I note that, at times when the Labor Party recognises that it is losing the argument on these issues, it says, `If we were there we would have a balanced program.' And it is important to recognise why that is the case. The first reason is that if you bring people to Australia under a skilled migration program, the impact on the budget is positive. It is something of the order of $36.7 million per thousand on the forward estimates. But if you bring people through the family migration program, the impact on the forward estimates is negative - and negative by $1.8 million per thousand. The fact is that skilled migrants have unemployment rates at about half the national average. Family stream migrants have unemployment rates at about twice the national average. So the argument is that if you bring more people through family migration to Australia, you are bringing them here essentially to be welfare dependent and without employment.  -   - That is the case. And it is totally non-discriminatory to make that point, and to allege that any suggestion about those differences is in some way racist is quite -  - If that is the sort of allegation that you want to make, you will live with that as part of your reputation. The point I want to make in relation to this is that I am very disappointed that the Labor Party appears to be rethinking its position in relation to this matter, because the honourable member for Batman the other day had to say that he thought it would be appropriate to look at making family arrangements more flexible for regional initiatives. What people need to understand is that if a skilled migrant comes to Australia under the skilled migration program, they bring with them their wife and their dependant children automatically as an entitlement.  - If honourable members are saying that we need to expand the program to attract skilled migrants so that they can bring their brothers and their sisters and their uncles and their aunts and their cousins, without any form of skill testing, they should recognise that those family members are entitled-and there are special initiatives in place in relation to regional Australia-to come under the Australian skill linked category. All that ensures is that they have English language competency and a skill that would enable them to get a job in the Australian labour market. If the Labor Party is rethinking its position on this matter, let the Leader of the Opposition make it clear. He wanted to go out and parade that he had a virtue in this area by supporting the measures that the government has put in place. He was out there saying to the Australia Israel Review back in June last year that he would increase substantially migration programs `but I would want to test the employment issue'. He went on to say `I would want to see really quite high levels of success in entry to the employment market.' If you are out there arguing that the brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and parents can come to Australia as part of a family reunion scheme to get skilled migrants here without testing them against the labour market, make it very clear because, brother, you will all be in trouble in your electorates if that is what you are advocating. </DOC>

 - I can inform the House that, following legislative changes and community and business consultation, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has today released its updated pricing guidelines for price changes relating to the new tax system. The updated guidelines are firm but fair. They put in place a regime that puts consumers first. They provide clear direction for businesses who are not about price exploitation. Importantly, we are protecting consumers from price exploitation or misleading and deceptive conduct. In particular, the guidelines deal with matters relating to the pricing of goods and services, price display, and enforcement and compliance issues. They clarify the principles that underpin the transition to the new tax system, including the principle that no price should rise by more than 10 per cent because of the new tax system changes. Putting consumers first is a key part of this government's policy objectives. I reissue a warning to unscrupulous businesses that if you try and rip off consumers you will face fines of up to $10 million. These guidelines are part of the most extensive price monitoring regime ever undertaken. The price guidelines, the price monitoring and law enforcement are the basis of the ACCC's work. - However, ultimately com---pe-tition is the best servant of the consumer. - I say again that competition is the best ally of the consumer. It has been proven with the recent wholesale sales tax changes that delivered better than expected results for consumers when we decreased the wholesale sales tax on certain goods from 32 per cent to 22 per cent. I note that the member for Hotham is shaking his head. Well, on this side of the House, we are still waiting for the price monitoring guidelines in relation to the introduction of capital gains tax. We are waiting for the guidelines in relation to fringe benefits tax. We are waiting for the guidelines in relation to the wholesale sales tax changes that occurred under the l-a-w tax cuts. Remember those - the l-a-w tax cuts? Where was the price monitoring? Where was the pursuit of businesses that were unscrupulously increasing prices to consumers? The opposition has no credibility on this issue. Their position in relation to price exploitation is pure hypocrisy. The ACCC will pursue those businesses that try to rip off consumers.</DOC>

It is not uncommon for Commonwealth departments to seek the advice of the AFP on issues which may involve criminal matters. The AFP have responsibility for matters where Commonwealth legislation is involved and it is a quite common occurrence for people to consult the AFP. My colleague Senator Vanstone has said in the Senate today that the department and the AFP will be meeting later this week on how the Riverside concerns and any other concerns in other homes may be addressed. She did not rule out that there may be matters for the state police or the state coroner.

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I know that he is concerned about the continuing confusion on the part of the Labor Party about its educational targets and objectives. We have had three national educational targets from the Labor Party in the last two weeks, all contracting one another. Two weeks ago, we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that his goal was that 100 per cent of young people should come out of their teens with a post-school qualification, a lift from 13 per cent now to 100 per cent. It turned out that was a blunder, the kind of blunder that the member for Werriwa is of course well aware of. The Leader of the Opposition has a very uncertain hand in this area. Secondly, he issued a revised target: that 90 per cent of young people should leave their teens with a year 12 or equivalent qualification. Unfortunately, the member for Dobell was not listening to that. He read from a different script on Monday night and said that the target actually was equivalent to an 82 per cent year 12 qualification rate. So there is now an eight per cent gap between targets of the member for Dobell and the Leader of the Opposition. Who is right? The Leader of the Opposition or his shadow minister? The Leader of the Opposition clearly does not know. He has no grasp of these matters. He is not sure who is right. Perhaps he should ring up the union.  - Perhaps he should ring up Shazza and ask what the target really ought to be. The problem the Leader of the Opposition is facing here is that he cannot get his mind around education. For two years he was minister for education - and what was his legacy? Thirty per cent of young Australians could not read and write properly and 20,000 traditional trade apprenticeships were destroyed in one year. What one has to say is that in his heart of hearts the Leader of the Opposition knows that he has a problem, because in Peter Fitzsimons's biography he is quoted as saying - and he is honest about this problem:I had sort of finally to accept that I would never be defence minister again, so I lost a lot of ambition. I stopped straining - Poor old diddums spat the dummy; he stopped straining. He went on to say:I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had.This was when young people could not read and write properly, and the Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister for education, thought that there was less opportunity to do something than in any other portfolio. The Sunday Age in May 1993 summed up this educational underachiever when it said:The greatest ambition harboured by a highly relieved Beazley was a change of portfolio. - So let us hear nothing about the educational ambition of the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. Clearly, the provision of communications services in the bush by a body in which the government holds a 50.1 per cent interest is one that attracts the reach of the Nyngan declaration. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to give that statement that kind of notoriety and it is very important because I want the people of Australia to know - and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his bipartisan support - that this government is very strongly committed to the maintenance and, where possible, the improvement of government services in rural and regional Australia. Our position is that Telstra has obligations not only to the government but, more importantly, to the Australian people. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when Telstra was 100 per cent owned by the government, there were 17,000 jobs taken out of it under the former Labor government and the justification used at the time was that there was no direct correlation between the employment level and the provision of services. On that occasion the Leader of the Opposition was right, and that is why we are right in saying that, just because there are going to be some redundancies in Telstra, that does not mean automatically that the quality of service is going to decline. Indeed, the quality of service in many industries has gone up in Australia over the last 10 years with fewer employees. Are people really arguing that the level of productivity, for example, in the steel industry in Australia is lower than it was 20 years ago when there were more people employed in that industry? Does the Leader of the Opposition have such a Neanderthal attitude towards the operation of the Australian economy that he fails to notice that one of the fastest growing sectors of the Australian economy is the communications sector?Unless my hearing failed me more than normally, I thought I heard the member for Bendigo illustrating the very point I was making. He was extolling the fact that there are a few hundred people employed by a communications carrier in the electorate of Bendigo - I think it was AAPT - and he was saying that there were 600 or 800 new jobs created. Thank you very much, Member for Bendigo. That is precisely the point that I make: in a growing, rapidly changing economic sector such as communications, jobs disappearing in one area of communications can easily re-emerge in another area. We have seen that happen in relation to the Job Network. We had this rather fallacious argument from the opposition that, because Employment National, the government owned job provider, had fewer contracts in the second tender round, that automatically meant that services collapsed. The reality is that services in the area of communications are not directly related to employment levels; they are related to a large number of things. And I say again for the benefit of those opposite but more particularly for the benefit of the people of Australia: it is the policy of this government that the existing level of telecommunications services in the bush is not only maintained but improved. That has been communicated to the management of Telstra and over the weeks and months ahead that company will have an obligation to deliver on the community service obligation that it has, and it will be required to deliver by its majority shareholder, which is the government. I also take this opportunity of making it perfectly clear to those who sit opposite that in the long run it remains the policy of this government, subject to the conditions laid down at the time of the last election, to proceed with the full privatisation of Telstra. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. In fact, he did draw to my attention the survey of manufacturing which was published recently by Australian Business and the Colonial State Bank, finding that manufacturers' confidence is on a high after a back-to-back boost:Business conditions for manufacturers have improved in the March quarter. It was the first back-to-back improvement in business conditions in more than five years.So that is a very good finding about confidence in the manufacturing sector. The Australian Business Managing Director, Philip Holt, said this:We are particularly pleased to see that, for the first time since mid-97, a majority of manufacturers have had their export sales increased from the previous quarter.So there are good manufacturing conditions and, most importantly, an improvement in exports for the manufacturing sector. Of course, one of the reasons why that is coming back since mid-1997 is that the Asian financial crisis which we went through in 1997 and 1998 appears now to have bottomed and the world is growing stronger. - The Prime Minister reminds me that we could have avoided the Asian financial crisis if his predecessor had remained in office! We saw that claim on the weekend. - He interpolates on me, Mr Speaker. Manufacturing will be the industry which benefits the most from the government's tax reform because, under Labor policy, indirect tax falls heavily on the manufacturing sector. Labor believes in having indirect tax on goods and only goods, and as goods shrink as a proportion of the economy Labor's policy was to kick the rates up. So, after the 1993 election, it took the 10 per cent rate to 12, the 20 per cent rate to 22 and the 30 per cent rate to 32, as the manufacturing sector bore a heavier and heavier burden of taxation under Labor. Basing a broad based goods and services tax at a low rate of 10 per cent helps the manufacturing industry. In addition, it particularly boosts exports. Mr Speaker, you do not have to take that just from me. That point has been made by the Manager of Opposition Business, Mr McMullan. When he was asked on radio station 5AA in Adelaide on 12 January 2000, `What about exports - what is the GST?' he said this:Well, the GST overall should be good for exports.That was the Labor Party: the GST should be good for exports - on radio station 5AA on 12 January. That was the Manager of Opposition Business, a former senator, who is now the member for Fraser. Here is Labor: it has been absolutely opposing a tax reform which is good for exports, which is good for the manufacturing industry and which is going to help create jobs in Australia. So we now have a situation where the Manager of Opposition Business thinks tax reform is good for exports and the member for Lilley wants to repeal the GST between now and 30 June but on 1 July he wants to keep it. His policy is to repeal it up until 30 June and, when the clock goes past midnight, he is suddenly in favour of it from 1 July. We have got the member for Werriwa who wants GST-free areas, we have got the member for Griffith who wants good OECD practice, we have got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yet to make his first speech on the economy - such a serious thinker, he is yet to make a speech on the economy - and we have the Leader of the Opposition, who is in favour of roll-back on an uncharted road with an unknown destination and who is so opposed to GST that, if he is ever elected, he wants to keep it. Tax reform is good for the manufacturing industry. It is good for exports. It is about time the Labor Party dropped this pretence and admitted they want this side of politics to do the hard work. They just want to take the benefit of it. You might as well join us and do the hard work if you ever want the country to take the benefit of tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and acknowledge the contribution that he has made in this place over a long period of time. The government proceeds with the reform of business taxation. The company tax rate in this country, which is currently 36 per cent, is going to fall to 34 per cent on 1 July and to 30 per cent the year after. The government has cut capital gains taxes. I might say that again, because this is the first government to have ever done this in Australian history. This government has cut capital gains taxes, and we halved the application of capital gains taxes from the end of September last year. For small business in particular, for farmers who hold an asset for a period of 15 years and want to retire, there is no capital gains tax on an active asset in their business, and they can retire from the farm into a town without paying capital gains tax. And we have introduced scrip for scrip rollover between companies to allow for more efficient returns to shareholders.In addition to these matters which have already been put in place, the government has asked for business consultation in relation to even more far-reaching reforms to business taxation. Those consultations have been conducted by the Business Coalition for Tax Reform under the chairmanship of Mr Dick Warburton. I want to acknowledge the work that Mr Warburton has done in consulting with the business community on the so-called option 2 from the Ralph review to see whether there is general support to proceed with those far-reaching reforms which would dramatically simplify the Australian taxation system. Mr Warburton has done a lot of work on this, and I note some of the comments that were in the paper today about where he is up to in his consultation. The government will be very interested to receive the results of that consultation.I make it clear that for small business there is the option to go under the simplified taxation system, which will mean that on a cash basis most of the tax value method of option 2 will not be applicable and so they will be cut out of any transitional costs. I also make it clear, as the government has said on a number of occasions, that we will be setting up an advisory board on the taxation system which will allow access to private sector expertise on a regular basis, not only on business tax but on all aspects of tax law, to help with any transitional costs in relation to option 2 and the ongoing business taxation. Such an advisory body would give the government the opportunity to consult with the business community. It would have a number of business representatives on it, but not just business representatives; it would have consumer representatives and people who are familiar with issues for PAYE taxpayers. The government is currently receiving expressions of interest and will evaluate them. After considering those expressions of interest, I hope to be able to announce the establishment of the membership of that particular board. I commend the business coalition for the work that it is doing. The simplification of the Australian taxation system is a goal to which we should all aspire. Indeed, if it can generate widespread business support, it is something that we can move to with consensus, which would be needed if this were to be put in place by 2001.  </DOC>

 - I point a couple of things out to the Leader of the Opposition. The first thing I point out is that the obligation to provide levels of service - in other words, the community service obligation - is enshrined in statute, and that obtains irrespective of who owns Telstra. This fact seems to have completely eluded the Leader of the Opposition. This notion that the only way you can have standards, the only way you can deliver services, is for the government to own it is totally fallacious. The requirement to provide services is there irrespective of who owns it, and I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that standards of service delivered by the old government owned to the extent of 100 per cent Telecom were in many respects massively inferior to the services that are being delivered today. - I remind the Leader of the Opposition that if you are really interested in service delivery for the bush you will be interested in the community service obligation, because that is how you deliver services to the bush. If the Leader of the Opposition is really interested in this matter, he should turn his attention to the community service obligation. I did not evade the second question. Clearly, declarations made relate to government services. The Leader of the Opposition knows exactly what I mean by government services and I think every member in the House knows exactly what I mean by government services. I simply point out to the Leader of the Opposition yet again that, when under your stewardship, Telecom, as it used to be called, was 100 per cent owned by the government, in many areas the service delivery was massively below what it is now. So, far from partial privatisation having led to fewer services in rural Australia, although we are far from happy with the level of service delivery in rural Australia - and I make that very clear - in many respects the service delivery now is significantly in advance of what it was four or five years ago when Telecom was 100 per cent owned and when the Leader of the Opposition in his former ministerial manifestation presided over the loss of 17,000 jobs in Telstra. He comes into this place today peddling this nonsense, trying to draw a direct link between literal employment levels and service delivery when he knows that in all the years he held government under both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating he would argue the opposite. - I have for the moment, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde, who is a great supporter of small business, a member of the government's committee on small business and a great advocate in this parliament for the interests of small business. I know she will be interested to know that the huge effort the government is undertaking, the biggest education and information program ever to support a tax reform, is now I think starting to have results and starting to get through to the small business community. I am told we had something like 100,000 registrations last week. On one day for the Australian business number we had 28,000 registrations. It is interesting that people are using the Internet as a means of getting those registrations in. Apparently, 40 per cent have been lodged through the Internet, with a turnaround of those applications of seven days. The ABN hotline is receiving up to 17,000 calls a day, and I am pleased to advise the House that over 600,000 registrations have now been lodged with the ATO. The effort continues in other areas. I was down the street in my electorate the other day, in Hastings, and I am pleased to report that, as I was waiting for my sandwich to be prepared, the person in the shop told me that the Taxation Office had actually doorknocked their particular business and offered them a helping hand with advice and assistance. We had 220,000 hits alone on the start-up assistance web site last week. We have had three million fliers distributed to assist small business. Under direct assistance for business, 5,300 supplier applications of GST related products have been made, and I recommend all members have a look at the GST start-up assistance web site to give you some sense of the very comprehensive service which is being provided to small business. We have had another 50,000 booklets and another 35,000 CDs sent or ordered. Most members would know that there have been something like 1,000 seminars conducted by the ATO up until Christmas and they are running apace now with the professional organisations. - I am interested in the interjection because the Labor Party are opposed to this. They are totally opposed to the GST and they are totally opposed - by the interjection - to the pay-as-you-go system. And we know why. Usually it is just opposition for the sake of opposition. In this case it is opposition for the sake of research because we know the Leader of the Opposition was asked by Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program only last month, `What does your research show? What will change votes?' and he said, `The two vote-changing issues that our research shows basically are people's concerns about health and of course the GST.' So this is a campaign based on the latest research. We know it is not based on their policy because, whilst they are opposed to the GST, if ever they were in government, of course they would keep it. And the Leader of the Opposition was out there saying on 1 June last year, `The problem for small business with this particular exercise that the incredibly cumbersome paperwork is totally unproductive labour,' so they are totally opposed to the pay-as-you-go system. But what was their policy on pay at the last election? They were going to introduce it. They are now totally opposed to that which was their policy, yet obviously if ever they were elected they would be in favour of the pay-as-you-go system because that is their policy. Usually it is that side of the paper; on this occasion it is this side, and they are in favour of it.Then just to add hypocrisy upon hypocrisy, if they were ever elected, they would roll back the GST, they would keep the pay-as-you-go system because they are in favour of it, but as they are now opposed to the pay-as-you-go system they are going to make it even more complex by the roll-back. This is just hypocrisy on a grand scale and, as the Leader of the Opposition says, it is not opposition for the sake of opposition; it is opposition because this is the latest research.We are doing this because it is good for small business. That is why you are seeing small business now making their applications. Sure, there is a transition period, but this is a transition to a better system. These people are totally opposed to it, but they will keep it. Furthermore, they will make it worse.</DOC>

 - I know one thing is absolutely certain in this case, and that is that I am totally right when I say that the ALP has absolutely no credibility here - none. The Prime Minister has referred to what it was like in the good old days when you ran telecommunications. You have form. - Surely it is relevant to illustrate the point by referring to alternative approaches to telecommunications policy. I happen to remember what it was like in the days when you ran it. I remember it well. You had people running all over the place, yet you still could not get services delivered in a reasonable time. - Mr Speaker, it is entirely relevant to make these points. The fact is that there was a real lack of competition, particularly in the area of competition that drove prices down. When it came to choice, you had the choice of what colour you wanted for your handset - as long as it was black. The point needs to be made that this issue of the link between services and personnel was obviously a real problem for the ALP.  -   - When the current Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible, 17,500 people went. Those were the days -  - Those were the days when they had not established a consumer guarantee. There was no consumer guarantee; that is the point of all of this. - Mr Speaker, the clear point in all of this is that there is no direct correlation between the delivery of services, which we have made quite plain we are intent upon improving, and the issue of actual employment levels of any one given company. I have been with Senator Boswell over the weekend. He understands entirely the point that I have sought to make here, that jobs and prosperity in rural areas will be underwritten by a first-class service delivery that is accessible, that is affordable, that is competitive and that gives people the edge that they need.  - You went around the process of shedding labour all over the place, with no guarantees at all in relation to customer services. We have. We have laid down what is required and we have put the teeth behind it to make sure that Telstra has to deliver. That is the difference.We have had Mr Beazley out there over the weekend saying, `When you remove linies' - by which he means linesmen - 'and techs from the bush, and they have been removed from regional Australia by the bushel over the last few years, when something goes wrong with somebody's phone, there isn't anybody to replace it.' I remember what it was like moving around the constituency in the early 1990s. I remember going to Delungra, Warialda and Mungindi, where people were saying, `There aren't enough people to fix the lines because they have all been pulled out of the depots.' The point is that we have put in place the guarantees that mean Telstra cannot do that any more.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. It could not have come from a more appropriate member of this House, because honourable members may be interested to know that the honourable member for Farrer is Australia's representative on the ASEAN CER free trade area task force. He has already been to a meeting of that task force. The very existence of this task force demonstrates the determination of this government to build close, practical and constructive relations with our neighbours which can be to the benefit of people in this country. The idea that we are pursuing, of building those economic links with the countries in South-East Asia to open up markets for Australians in South-East Asia, is a practical and constructive way of engaging with our neighbours.  The government has recently become a member of the East Asia-Latin America Forum, another practical illustration of Australia building links with not just our own region but other regions around the world. The House should be reminded that this government played an extremely active role in helping our regional neighbours through the Asian economic crisis. We and Japan were the only two countries in the world that supported all three IMF packages, and we very considerably increased our aid budget for countries most seriously affected by the crisis. It does beg the question, as the honourable member said: are there any alternative approaches? The fact is that there are alternative approaches, at least in a somewhat hypothetical sense. When I came back from Papua New Guinea on Saturday morning, I was greeted with the Weekend Australian magazine and a photograph on it saying, `He's back,' I wondered why the children were a bit disconcerted on Saturday morning.  -  - I knew that would get you going. You would not sit there quietly for long, would you? When I looked at this article, which I am sorry to have to report to the House is somewhat bitter and paranoid, I saw one particular part that I thought the House would be interested in, because it does demonstrate an alternative approach. The journalist who wrote the article seems to be somewhat of a fan of the former Prime Minister. - Labor men normally aren't. The journalist wrote:... Keating's assessment of what he would have done in foreign policy is typically bold and breathtaking.Then there was the quote:'I think we would have avoided a lot of the Asian crisis ...'Had Labor won the 1996 election under Keating, all of these people would have been ministers in the Keating government and the Asian economic crisis would have passed the world by; it would never have happened. If I have read a more fatuous and foolish comment in an interview I would be interested to be reminded of it. It is a pathetic reflection of the Labor Party - and this is the relevant point - that that statement by Mr Keating constitutes all there is of Labor's foreign policy: had Labor been re-elected there would not have been any Asian economic crisis. In conclusion, I noticed that, had Labor been re-elected, according to Mr Keating, they would have done nothing about East Timor; that would not have mattered. They are bold on rhetoric in opposition but very silent in government. It is a sad thing that the Labor Party have to depend on Mr Keating now for any comment at all on foreign policy.</DOC>

 - Obviously farmers and all people in rural and regional Australia are very keen to have a quality telecommunication service. That is their highest priority - a good quality service that enables them to interact and to transact business around the world and to get access to all the latest information as quickly as possible. That is their objective. They want that to be delivered in a competent way. If it is delivered by Telstra or some other company, their fundamental interest is in that service being delivered in a quality way.There are many people in rural and regional Australia who are disappointed with the way in which Telstra has responded to their demands for services and the speed at which these things have been rolled out. They have looked to other companies to deliver that kind of service. Indeed, there are now many employees from alternative companies who are providing services in the bush. I heard a little earlier that the member for Bendigo has identified that some of those are employed in the electorate of Bendigo. That is also true in many other regional areas. So it certainly takes people to deliver services; it takes technology to deliver services, but there are many ways in which those services can be provided and provided in a quality way. This government, through its community service obligation, has legislated to guarantee that there will be a quality service delivered and we are determined to see that happen. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I know how concerned he is about the actions of the New South Wales Teachers Federation in that state. I informed the House last week of the inexcusable slap in the face that the New South Wales Teachers Federation has delivered to the parents of New South Wales schoolchildren. This union has engaged in massive educational vandalism in that state. This was revealed today in the Sydney media, which reminded us of the extent of the union's obstruction and educational treachery. On at least three occasions there have been bans on school reports, HSC marking, procedures covering student care and safety, and literacy testing. We are seeing inexcusable action by a union which is a close friend of the federal Labor Party. Parents in New South Wales are entitled to ask whether at any point the Leader of the Opposition has stood up and asked the union to stop its industrial action, has condemned the actions of the union and has said that the Labor Party will have none of this. Of course we have had crashing silence from the Leader of the Opposition. He has not, I am quite sure, telephoned Ms Burrow and asked for the Australian Education Union to intervene. Government members - Shazza! - If he has rung up Shazza at all it has been to ask where the ALP's education policy is. The union has been very slow in delivering this policy. There is no policy on that side. Until the union delivers one there will not be a policy. Make no mistake: this union, this destructive educational vandal, has carried out its action without the slightest word of condemnation from the Labor Party. The Australian Education Union will be writing the Labor Party's educational policy and the Leader of the Opposition will not rock the boat. Why? He made that quite clear in Workers Online on 3 March when he said:I want a close relationship. ... I regard the relationship with the union movement as a plus.With friends like the Teachers Federation, who needs enemies? We have a party on the other side of the House closely linked, day in, day out, with the most destructive educational organisation in the country. They make not a word of criticism or condemnation. Parents in New South Wales are entitled to draw the conclusion that they can expect nothing supportive of the education of their children from the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As the minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I am more than happy to take this question. Telstra has indicated that no final decisions have been made in respect of the call centre optimisation program. It is therefore not possible to discuss individual centres. Naturally, the communications environment is very competitive and Telstra is reviewing all of its operations, including call centres, with a view to offering a cheaper and better service to its customers. Competition also allows other companies to enter the market. The member for Bendigo gave us a classic example a short while ago with the new call centre being established in Bendigo by AAPT, a new entrant into the market. They have announced they are setting up a call centre in Bendigo, creating 413 full-time jobs. Telstra has indicated it is very aware of the effects of its business decisions on staff and the local community, particularly in rural areas. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The historic GP memorandum of understanding is now delivering for both patients and general practitioners. It has been in place since the middle of last year. It showed great foresight and courage on the part of the medical groups that were involved in its signature and undertaking. It is already working for Australians. As a result of the GP memorandum of understanding, we now have an annual health check for older Australians. This was introduced in November. Already, over 20,000 older Australians have taken advantage of this with over 6,000 people having the annual assessment in their own homes. This changes the way general practitioners do their work and can treat their patients. It gives a greater focus on prevention. It allows items that have not previously been covered under Medicare to now be covered.Secondly, it gives us a framework where we can modernise the medical benefits schedule in ways which can lead to better health outcomes. We are developing a program to enable GPs to undertake population health activities, something they have never been able to do under Medicare. We are looking at a patient-doctor charter which outlines the rights and responsibilities of each. We are looking at further scope for telemedicine consultations and mechanisms to improve access to patients for a wide range of services at doctors' surgeries. The GP memorandum of understanding is looking at ways in which we can increase facilities for patients to claim from Medicare. This was discussed in the House last week.From 1 May, the memorandum of understanding will result in a 2.25 per cent increase in the Medicare rebate for GP attendance. This is over and above the normal 1 November increase. This is a one-off increase that would not have happened had this memorandum of understanding not been in place. This will increase the schedule B rebate by 50c per consultation, and will be a significant boost to high quality general practice. This is a direct result of cooperation between GP groups and the federal government. It has shown that, working in cooperation, we can deliver for both the public and general practitioners.I was asked if I was aware of any alternative plans. I am not aware of any alternative plans, because the opposition has not had a single original idea on health in four years in opposition. The shadow minister for health was prepared to put out carping, negative, opportunistic press releases saying that this would lead to a blow-out in the Commonwealth budget. It has not. She has also said that it would lead to a collapse in bulk-billing. It has not. She has been proven wrong. We are delivering in this area.</DOC>

 - Alchera was visited on 8 March by assessors from the aged care standards agency, who undertook a spot check. There is no immediate risk to residents. The accreditation agency has done two reviews and spot checks of Alchera. - Quite clearly, the opposition indicate that they want information, and then they purport not to want it. So I will continue. The accreditation agency is supervising a second plan of improvement with the service, and two assessors remained at the home until 10 March to provide support. I am aware that two GPs are now raising concerns relating to care at Alchera last year. But, if the GPs consider the matter to be serious and related to the death of a resident, they should report it to the Queensland coroner. - The fact of the matter is that Alchera was raised. There were concerns that were raised and, accordingly, the response was to have a spot check done and to have reviews in order that we can be sure that in fact this home is properly monitored. As I said, the Alchera Park Nursing Home had been the subject of complaint and, as a result of that complaint, spot checks were conducted to ensure that there is no serious risk.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Aston because I know he has a very firm commitment to helping the elderly and all those receiving some type of social security payment. Before I actually explain to the Australian Labor Party and the rest of the Australian public some of the enormous benefits that are coming through the new tax system on 1 July, this House should know that, as of next Monday, 3.5 million Australians will receive substantial increases in their payments. The pension rate will increase by $5.50 a fortnight to $372 for single pensioners, and for couples there will be an extra $4.60, taking it to $310.50. For those single allowees over the age of 21, there will be a $5.30 increase, taking the maximum rate to $358.70 -  - and for couples an increase of $4.50, taking it to $299.10. What this means, particularly for pensioners, is that, when our four per cent increase comes in, pensioners will have a $20 a fortnight increase within four months time. And that is equivalent to an increase of around $520 over a year. That is true compensation going to pensioners. And there are other measures that have been put in place. We are putting in compensation measures that were never put in by the Australian Labor Party with their policies. I will come to them in a moment. Turning to other measures, there is the taper rate. For the first time the taper rate will be reduced from 50 to 40 per cent. There will be real increases in the maximum rate of rent assistance - by seven per cent. There will be an increase in the assets and income test free areas - by 2.5 per cent - which the member for Lilley may wish to listen to. We are introducing an aged persons savings bonus of up to $1,000. But there is more than that, as the member for Aston knows. For the first time, after 1 July single pensioners can earn up to $14,500 and not pay taxation and couples can earn up to $24,500, giving them the incentive to save and to earn. And, of course, for the first time 50,000 self-funded retirees will become eligible for pensions.But let us look at the alternatives. When you guys were in power, as the Treasurer articulated earlier on, there was no compensation when WST went up - none at all - from 10 to 12, from 20 to 22 or from 30 to 32 per cent. There was no compensation whatever. You promised tax cuts. We know what happened to those: they never materialised. There were no tax cuts. You did not tie it to total male average weekly earnings - which was probably just as well, because male average weekly earnings went down under your stewardship. Of course, these are the measures we have put in place. But you have no plan. You have no plan whatsoever. Of course, the member for Werriwa has his special GST exemption zones. The member for Griffith - well meaning as he may be - has his plans for the OECD. The member for Dickson does not have an employment plan; there is a discussion paper, and that is positive, I suppose. And of course there is the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley's plan is roll back. Are you going to roll back the compensation package on 1 July? I will tell you what you all have in common -  - What you all have in common is that theme of the lowest common denominator, which is fear. Fear and scare tactics are all very much encapsulated in Wayne's world: create fear, whether it is with people in nursing homes or people who are less privileged and have less advantage, particularly the pensioners and self-funded retirees, who we are looking after.</DOC>

 - The complaints raised by Mrs Bohm require careful investigation and consultation with the agency. Indeed, a response will be provided to Mrs Bohm when the information is received. Officers from the complaints resolution scheme contacted the facility on 29 February by phone to follow up the matters that were raised, both on 27 February with the department and then with the phone call to me on 28 February, which I have already put on the record in this House. When that report has been furnished to Mrs Bohm, I have asked for a copy of it. I am informed Mrs Bohm has agreed that, if all the improvements proposed within the action plan were to be implemented, she would be satisfied with the action taken. The information that I gave to this House, when I was told that the complaint had been resolved on 18 January 2000, was in fact the advice that I had been given through the department and it was advice that I was entitled to rely upon.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know of his interest. I was in his electorate last year, up in Broome, talking with people about indigenous employment opportunities. The government announced a big program last year of a doubling of funds. We have been working with communities and others to see the full implementation of the government's policy initiatives. One of the things we have been doing is to encourage some of Australia's biggest companies, in particular the CEOs of those companies, to be personally interested in doing what they can through their companies to provide more employment opportunities. It is a long and difficult task, but I can report to the House that we have had a fair measure of success. I am pleased to announce to the House today that Pasminco has agreed to take on another 95 trainees at their Century Zinc operation in the gulf. I was there last year, and I personally spoke with trainees at Pasminco. They seem to have a very good operation in place. It is a very practical program. I believe it works, and I think they should be congratulated for taking this further step in their program with the appointment of an additional 95 trainees.This is one aspect of a multifaceted approach that the government has. This is only one of seven subprojects to the total employment policy. In this area, though, we have something like $800,000 going in. In this particular case Pasminco are putting in $3 million, so it is a real commitment on their part. They are taking trainees from Normanton, Burketown, Mornington Island and Gregory. They will go through a lot of training programs, including hospitality, mining, environmental, pastoral and information technology traineeships and apprenticeships. I believe that, with reaching 700, we ought to be aiming for a thousand, and we are. Whilst these stories do not get front page in the Sydney Morning Herald,  this is just another example of genuine efforts by this government to help Aboriginal people, indigenous people, into permanent jobs and to give them the training to back it up and make it a reality for them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and for his support for great government programs like Work for the Dole, Green Corps and others. Work for the dole schemes have a long and honourable history in Australia. As Noel Pearson has repeatedly pointed out, passive welfare is the poison that destroys communities. It is the kindness that kills. What is happening is that the government's Work for the Dole program is in many ways an extension to the wider community of policies that have been helping indigenous Australians to regain the dignity of work for the best part of 20 years.This lesson seems to have been lost on at least some members of the Australian Labor Party. Last Thursday, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Councillor Jim Soorley, derided Work for the Dole as being of no lasting benefit to the community. How dare he denigrate the work of participants and community organisations in projects that he has never visited. Last Thursday, Australian Labor Party members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly unsuccessfully supported a resolution condemning Work for the Dole in ACT schools How dare Labor members of parliament condemn projects when they have never visited any? I challenge the diehard sceptics to break out of their ideological ghettos and go out and visit some Work for the Dole projects. They will discover that the 50,000 young Australians who have participated in this program are decent young people who are fair dinkum about getting work, and they deserve the support of all members of this House. I have been asked about alternative views. There are all sorts of alternative views, but unfortunately there is no alternative policy. The ALP used to have a policy on Work for the Dole when the member for Batman was the employment spokesman. The policy was that community organisations should participate in the program and make the most of it. Since the member for Dickson has become the employment spokesman, this policy has sailed off into the Bermuda Triangle. Like so many other Labor policies and principles, it has disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle. When the member for Dickson was the Leader of the Australian Democrats, she opposed making Work for the Dole compulsory. She also opposed making Work for the Dole something like a Working Nation program with credential training.A lot has changed. The member for Dickson has changed party, changed House and changed philosophy. It is important to know whether she has changed her views on this subject as well. So far, the only discernible policy of the member for Dickson is to demand that the government send out the ALP's 2010 employment forecast to every school in Australia. I would have thought that that was something the member for Dickson could do herself, using her own postage allowance. It is just not good enough. The Leader of the Opposition ought to put his employment spokesman on probation. He ought to give that spokesman three months to come up with a policy. If a credible, costed policy is impossible, at least a considered opinion would do for the time being.</DOC>

 - The report upon which the delegate made a decision that sanctions should be applied to withdraw the licences and approved provider status in the Riverside Nursing Home case was released on the decision of the secretary, who decided that it was a matter of public importance that it be released. Otherwise, under the legislation it would not ordinarily have been released. A full review audit will be put on the Net in accordance with the time schedule laid down in the principles, which is the subordinate legislation to the act, and that will occur in accordance with the timetable that has been established. The second thing to say is that the action that was taken was the correct action. We could see that the residents who were at Riverside could not remain there, and the report has shown the reasons why the delegate made the decision. In accordance with the timetable laid down in the principles, the agency will be releasing the full audit report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Obviously, representing an electorate that has an enormous inbound tourism industry, he is interested in the export of services from Australia. Interestingly, my attention has been drawn to our trade relationship with Europe and the current trade statistics with Europe. Last week, the shadow spokesman for trade referred to the Australian-European trade relationship. He said, `Whichever way you view the facts, it always comes out the same. The Europe-Australia relationship is a significant one which has been neglected in recent years.' He makes the assertion that it has been neglected, but the statistics tell a different story. The member for Cowper will be very interested in them: since 1996, exports of manufactured goods to Europe have increased by 23 per cent and exports of value added primary products have increased by 54 per cent. As part of those value added primary products, wine exports to Europe alone have doubled to $716 million. More interestingly, exports of services have climbed by 8.5 per cent to $5.5 billion. A lot of that is from tourism into Australia and into the member for Cowper's electorate. Since we have been in office, we have paid a great deal of attention in that part of the world to expanding the capacity of our exports. Of course, that will increase, and we will become far more competitive following the introduction of the government's tax changes on 1 July this year, when we will see a reduction of $3½ billion worth of indirect taxes on exports - a reduction of taxes on exports that will benefit exporters, which has been acknowledged by the member for Canberra.Unlike the Keating Labor government's policy on trade of Asia only - at least Mr Keating had a policy - we have a policy of Asia plus: Asia plus North America, plus South America, plus the Middle East, plus Africa and plus Europe. That is our policy. We are focusing on developing strong export markets in all those areas. It was interesting to note that on the weekend, because of the lack of policy from the current Labor Party, they had to trot out Mr Keating to indulge in his favourite pastime: rewriting history. skipping along the yellow brick road, as Miranda Devine put it in the Daily Telegraph today - skipping down the yellow brick road of reality.Going back to the lack of policy by the Labor Party in any area, as part of the shadow spokesman's speech last week, he indicated that he was going to announce some policy, which was quite enlightening and quite hopeful for all Australian exporters. In his speech he said, `A Beazley Labor government will breathe new life into the relationship. I will announce how we intend to do this while in Europe.' He is not going to announce it in Sydney, Melbourne or Newcastle - where a lot of those wine exports come from; he is going to announce it when he is in Europe.  - It could be while he is checking out the wine in Bordeaux. - We are interested in hearing what Labor's policy is going to be in this area; unfortunately the exporters in Australia will not be able to hear it first-hand, unless they travel to some of those good Aussie Labor heartlands like London or Paris or Geneva.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question. Several weeks ago I received a letter from the Premier of Tasmania which I can only describe as correctly falling within the sort of correspondence you would expect a premier interested in pursuing his state's future would write to a Prime Minister. It was a letter seeking a meeting with me to discuss energy matters, including Bass Link, and I readily agreed to that meeting. But yesterday there appeared on the front pages of the two major newspapers in Tasmania a declaration from the Premier of Tasmania that he was coming to Canberra to demand job guarantees from the Prime Minister. This comes of course from a Labor Premier of Tasmania who watched unemployment in that state go to 12.1 per cent under the stewardship of the current Leader of the Opposition. What the Premier of Tasmania has sought to do with the meeting I am having with him tomorrow is not to engage in a serious discussion with me about the future interests of the people of Tasmania, but to endeavour to turn tomorrow's meeting into a media sideshow and to use it as an opportunity to score cheap political points at the expense of the Commonwealth government. It ought to be possible for a Labor Premier of Tasmania to have a serious and constructive discussion with a Liberal Prime Minister of Australia without the sort of petty point-scoring nonsense that Mr Bacon has engaged in. I intend to honour the arrangement I made to meet Mr Bacon tomorrow, but I want to make it very clear to the Premier and, through this parliament, to the people of Tasmania that the people of Tasmania elected somebody to govern for all Tasmanians. They did not elect somebody to use his every waking hour when he deals with the national government to try to score political points off us. He even had the temerity to issue a press statement saying, `The Prime Minister must act on Telstra jobs threat.' Everybody, including Mr Bacon, must know that no state in Australia got a better deal out of the first and second sales of Telstra than did the state of Tasmania. He ought to take that press statement along to the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier of New South Wales or the Premier of Queensland. I would say to Mr Bacon: `You ought to understand that you are Premier of the state of Tasmania. You have been elected to govern for everybody and you have a higher obligation than engaging in this sort of grubby point scoring against a political opponent.'</DOC>

 - May I first of all say that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Community Services, and the member for Gilmore are in every sense outstanding and impeccably honest representatives of the people they represent. I have visited the electorates of both the Minister for Community Services and the member for Gilmore -   - I cannot help but remark that on both occasions I received a warm welcome. In relation to the caravan park issue -  - The member for Grayndler has asked me a question and I will answer that question. I observe, in the course of answering it, that he belongs to a party that wants to increase income tax for all caravan park occupants. He belongs to a political party that is falsely representing to the occupants of caravan parks around Australia that if you took away the option which now exists under the legislation, those caravan park occupants would be better off. The reality is that they would not be better off.  - The reality is that if you take away the five per cent GST option - in other words you deny to the operators of those parks the capacity to claim back their input tax credit - the rental impact of that decision will be equivalent in almost all cases to the imposition of the five per cent GST. You are the people who are misrepresenting the situation, not my colleagues on this side of the House. If you were really honest you would say to those people - some of whom are in the gallery today - that if the five per cent option is taken away they will be no better off, and in some cases they will be worse off. Those who sit opposite are the great deceivers on this issue. Those who sit opposite are miserably holding out to people the idea that they would be better off if they would follow the exhortations of the Australian Labor Party. They would not be. I say to those people who have come today: `Welcome to Canberra; you are always very welcome.' I also say to them: `Don't believe this mob opposite. They are going to jack up your income tax, and, if they have their way, they are going to impose upon you an arrangement that will not make you better off by one cent; in many cases you would be worse off.' So the option remains: we will not be altering the legislation. I say one final thing to you: `If you want your income tax to go up, vote Labor.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question, and I am quite pleased to outline for him the benefits for local government of the introduction of the goods and services tax. The first thing that happens for local government is that they can claim back all embedded taxes on all of the services which they use. This means that, for local government, communication services will become about four per cent cheaper, repair services will become about six per cent cheaper, and business services will become about 2.5 per cent cheaper. For legal, accounting, marketing and business management services, after they claim full input tax credit, their costs should fall by about 2.5 per cent. For local government, they charge no GST on water, sewerage or waste so they are able to deliver those services at a lower cost.  You do not have to take my word for the benefits to local government that come from the goods and services tax. I have here a letter telling about some of the benefits that arise from the introduction of the goods and services tax. This letter is written by the Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Egan. He wrote to Thomas George, MP, the member for Lismore, on 22 December 1999, explaining why the New South Wales government would not be sharing competition policy payments with local government. He said that local government were getting enormous benefit from competition policy, and then he said this:In addition to the above gains, local government also stands to be a major beneficiary in funding arrangements following the introduction of the proposed goods and services tax.I would like to table that letter from the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Michael Egan, to Thomas George, MP, dated 22 December 1999.I am also indebted to the member for Macquarie for giving me a copy of a letter that was sent to him. This is a letter which he received on 7 March 2000, and it says that the New South Wales government had no need to share competition policies with local government because `in addition to the above gains, local government also stands to be a major beneficiary in funding arrangements following the introduction of the proposed goods and services tax.' This is a letter to the member for Macquarie from the Labor Minister for Regional Development, Hon. Harry Woods. We remember Harry very well - he was a Labor member of the House of Representatives. We would like to send Harry a cheerio and thank him for his support of the goods and services tax. Can you imagine the poor old member for Macquarie? He would have been absolutely gobsmacked to get this letter from Harry extolling the virtues of the goods and services tax. The member for Macquarie probably walked into his electorate office on 7 March 2000 and asked his electorate secretary, `Any mail?' and his electorate secretary said, `Oh, just another letter from the Labor Party on the benefits of the goods and services tax.' Just another one in from Harry, to back up the one from Michael Egan. The Labor Treasurer of Queensland has written to me saying, `Please don't extend exemptions on the goods and services tax; we need the revenue.' Michael Egan has written to state National Party members saying, `Look at the benefits of the goods and services tax for local government.' Harry Woods has started writing to federal Liberal members, telling them about the benefit of the goods and services tax. The only people who apparently cannot see it are the so-called Labor thinkers on the front bench of the federal opposition. A modern oxymoron: Labor thinker on the front bench of the Labor Party. They should take a leaf out of the book of their state colleagues - get on board, recognise the benefits and support the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It gives me an opportunity to point to the fact that, although Labor never had a customer service guarantee or anything like it, we do. We put in place a customer service guarantee. It was part of the amendments to the 1997 Telecommunications Act, resulting from a commitment that we made in the 1996 election policy. - As I just said, and to repeat the point, it is now part of the Telecommunications Act. There are very real obligations upon Telstra, and real fines have been applied for failure to meet the standards required. The minimum standards that telephone companies must meet under the CSG have been developed by the Australian Communications Authority, following directions given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. The standards include, for example, the times within which new services must be connected and faults rectified. They indicate that appointments must be made and kept. For example, for new standard telephone service connections that are close to available infrastructure with spare capacity, telephone companies have the following working time frames: five days for urban communities - more than 10,000 people; 10 days for major rural communities - 2,500 to 10,000 people and so forth. What is more, the House might like to know that, from July this year, they will be significantly tightened. For example, there will be a new standard reducing the time -  -  - It is quite apparent that those opposite are not interested in the obligations that we put upon companies. They never did; we do. Companies are obliged under the law to meet them or to pay quite stiff penalties. I make the point that, from July this year, the time the telephone companies will have to supply new phone connections in rural and remote areas where there is infrastructure will be reduced from 40 to 15 days.</DOC>

 - In light of the rather scandalous and outrageous behaviour of the opposition in this matter, where statements have been made by the spokesman for the opposition, who said on 28 February that full powers under the act to revoke the licence of the Riverside Nursing Home providers should be used by me. Yet, a week later, he said that moving people was not the solution. And then the member for Isaacs said that he was certainly not going to suggest for a minute that the residents would be better off in Riverside.There is so much confusion surrounding the facts that I want to put them on the record today. Firstly, under the act, the accreditation standards agency is obliged to publish the review audit in accordance with the time frame. As I said yesterday, that is now on the web site. Secondly, there is a first risk report, where the opposition seems to be saying there is some sort of conspiracy theory going on. I intend to table both of these reports in the parliament here today. The risk report has been released pursuant to the power of the delegate of the secretary under the act.I will begin by saying that the agency's reports support entirely the decision of the secretary's delegate to impose sanctions on 22 February and they form part of the material considered by the secretary's delegate, together with the second risk report, which has already been released, when making a determination to revoke approved provider status and revoking the licences.These reports provide evidence that the government and the department have acted properly and speedily in this issue while observing due process. This includes making agency reports available to the public concerning the risks at Riverside. All procedures followed were in accordance with legal advice and the time frame set out in the act and in the subordinate legislation. As far as the opposition were concerned, we were damned if we did and damned if we didn't. They said there was a cover-up relating to the reports. Yesterday in the House, the member for Jagajaga improperly suggested that I had misled the House about my referral of an agency report. She suggested that I had caused the department to write to the Australian Federal Police three days before I saw a report. In fact, I asked the department to contact the AFP after I saw the first serious risk report, which you will see when it is tabled in this House. The facts are that the review audit report of 24 February, which incorporated the first serious risk report, was referred to the AFP on Monday 6 March, as I reported to this place. It contains the information that concerned me in the first serious risk report. I simply will not be verballed by the opposition. This is an opposition that was so concerned by the censure motion moved against me, moved by the Leader of the Opposition and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that they could not even bother to vote on it. They forgot to vote. It was so important and they were so concerned about elderly Australians that they forgot to vote on their own motion moved by their leader and his deputy. It is important that rogue providers, like the Riverside approved provider, are put into perspective. The vast majority of aged care providers are good providers and they provide good care. In an interview yesterday Professor Gary Andrews, the Director of the Centre for Ageing Studies at Flinders University, said:... It's a very big system. There are something over seventy thousand nursing home beds throughout Australia. And so it's inevitable that some of those will not be provided at an adequate standard and that of course is why there are systems of inspection and accreditation and so on to ensure that as far as humanly is possible everybody in a nursing home bed receives at least a minimal standard of quality of care and hopefully better than that....		...		...I think we've got pretty good care now, to be honest, but it can always be improved and this is the objective of the accreditation program, not only that it ensures there's improvement overall through inspection and accreditation but that nursing homes themselves, their proprietors, their staff and indeed the residents see quality improvement, continuous improvement as an important aspect of providing those services.The behaviour of the opposition in trying to say that I have concealed six deaths is despicable. The fact of the matter is that the first serious risk report relates to the deaths of three residents at Riverside and these were audited by the agency. Had they considered these deaths suspicious, they would have been obliged to refer them to the police or to the coroner, as indeed would the doctor or doctors signing the death certificates. I now wish to table the first serious risk report by the agency, dated 18 February 2000, which has now been released by the secretary's delegate, the review audit report by the agency dated 24 February 2000, which has now been published by the agency and is on the agency's web site, and a transcript of the comments by Professor Gary Andrews. - You bet it is.</DOC>

 - What the honourable member failed to add to his question is what the Labor Party did when it allowed 17,000 jobs to be cut from Telstra. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, the Labor Party allowed 17,000 jobs to be lost from Telstra and, at the same time, had no regulatory framework in place which would maintain customer and consumer standards. Consequently, they come to this place with no credibility whatsoever. I was very interested in a comment made recently on ABC radio by Col Cooper, president of the communications division of the CEPU. He was talking about how there has been an improvement in standards by Telstra. I was also interested in a statement he made to the Senate Telstra inquiry, as reported in September 1996. He said:On the figures that have been put to us -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was trying to assist the House by putting the question in its context before coming to answer it with exact pertinence. May I finish the quote by Col Cooper on this issue of reduction in job levels at Telstra. He is quoted as telling the Senate:On the figures that have been put to us, we have agreed in some areas that there can be staff reductions. We have been through all these processes with new technology.So to stress the point that has been made by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the last few days: there is not a direct correlation between levels of service and job levels at Telstra. - The opposition will attempt to confuse and muddy the waters on this issue of employment levels, but they clearly cannot do so convincingly. I am not aware of such a document. What I do know is that 88 per cent of Telstra's employees, as part of their job placement program, have found other employment. A headline in the Australian today says: `Telstra layoffs 'help' industry'. If there is some implication that the Telstra employees will be abandoned, that is simply incorrect.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I can inform the House that the government has legislated to increase all social security and veterans' pensions by four per cent from 1 July 2000. The four per cent increase means that the single rate of pension will be increased by $14.90 a fortnight and the combined married rate of pensions will increase by $24.80 a fortnight. It was this side of politics that increased pensions and allowances. In addition to the increase in pensions and allowances on 1 July, the government will be increasing the pharmaceutical allowance and the mobility allowance by four per cent. The maximum rate of rent assistance will be increasing by seven per cent. There will be a 2½ per cent increase in the income and asset test free area, and age pensioners with personal income from savings and investments will receive a one-off, non-taxable aged persons savings bonus. The government will match dollar for dollar each dollar they have in income from savings and investments up to $1,000. In addition, of course, the government introduced a 30 per cent private health rebate, which has been of significant benefit to pensioners and self-funded retirees. I am asked by the member for Sturt whether there are any alternative plans for compensation. Needless to say, the opposition, which now has a policy of keeping GST, has not put forward any proposals for compensation other than the prospect of lifting income tax rates. But there was an article putting a new proposal in the Financial Review today -  - along the lines of spatial economics, Prime Minister. It said that the way in which compensation should be done was that:A Labor government should exempt shopping centres in public housing estates, depressed country towns and remote Aboriginal communities from the GST.That proposal was put forward by the member for Werriwa who is described by the press as one of Labor's thinkers. He began his article in today's Financial Review saying:The Federal Opposition has not had many happy headlines in recent weeks about our plan to rollback the GST. Kevin Rudd, an habitual letter writer to this newspaper, obviously wasn't too happy about the favourable comment given to one of my proposals in last week's press.Welcome to the modern ALP.You will recall that spatial economics was described by the member for Griffith as `loopy'. He said this:Latham has written much that is innovative ... His most recent tax proposal, however, is just plain loopy.So we have the member for Werriwa who, according to the member for Griffith, is `loopy loo' over spatial economics. We have got the member for Griffith who wants to follow OECD best practice. We have got the member for Lilley who is so opposed to the GST that he will repeal it any time before midnight on 30 June and then vote to keep it once the clock ticks over on 1 July. We have got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said on 19 February, `GST cannot be made fair under any circumstances. Labor believes the GST itself cannot be made fair,' but he is committed to keeping it. And we have the Leader of the Opposition whose campaign against the GST was felled two weeks ago by a blank sheet of paper. That is when his campaign against the GST came to an end. The member for Werriwa said something which I really do believe is significant - and he is right. He said:As expected, Rudd has no suggestions of his own to assist the poor. As ever, rhetoric is easy in politics. Change is hard.That is what the member for Werriwa said: change is hard. The member for Werriwa knows precisely what this stunt is all about. This is a stunt by the Labor Party to try and pretend it is against change and to make the government do all the hard yards until such time as the Labor Party can fall into office and try and take advantage of it.This is an opposition which will not do anything that is hard - a weak, populist leadership which pretends that you can go on with an indirect tax, based on a shrinking part of the economy. Is the Labor frontbench going to wander up to the Irish Taoiseach tonight and say to him, `You're absolutely wrong with the value added tax, Taoiseach. You need a modern wholesale sales tax as thought up by the Australian Labor Party and practised in Botswana and Swaziland.' Is that the speech it is going to be giving tonight? Does it go overseas and say to France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Singapore, `You've all got it wrong'? The Australian Labor Party wants to campaign on cheap populist rhetoric, and it has been belled by the member for Werriwa who says, `Change is hard.' Too right it is hard, and it is far too hard for the Leader or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question and his involvement and interest in this important, indeed crucial, area of public policy. The government moved very quickly, on coming to office in March 1996, to establish a regulatory framework that was missing, negligently, because of our predecessors' inaction. We extended the universal service obligation to include a digital data obligation so that all Australians have access to email and the Internet. We established price controls requiring Telstra to reduce the price of its main services by 5½ per cent in real terms each year and special restrictions on local access prices and prices faced by low spending customers. We established the Telecommunications Ombudsman Scheme which provides independent resolution of consumer complaints and service issues. In addition, we introduced the customer service guarantee, which has been explained today in eloquent fashion by the Deputy Prime Minister, which requires companies to pay customers financial compensation if they do not meet a set of standards regarding installation, repair, keeping of appointments and the like.So we are holding the carriers, including Telstra, to these higher and new levels of service standards. Telstra is paying a price when it does not meet the government's standards. For example, in the 1998-99 financial year, Telstra paid over $1 million in customer service guarantee compensation to customers. The average payment was $190 per customer. At the moment Telstra is averaging 3,000 payments per month and, over the last couple of months, over 17 per cent of the payments have exceeded $1,000 per customer. So there is a great deal of room for improvement which the government will require Telstra, as we do the other carriers, to uphold. If service quality does not improve substantially next year, the government's new requirement for phone companies to pay customer service guarantee penalties to customers automatically means that the annual customer service guarantee payout is likely to be $40 million. Of course customers want their phone services repaired or installed on time, but, if that is not so, compensation is forced upon the carriers by this government - something that was sadly lacking before we came to office. There is an incentive, indeed penalties, for companies to perform to our standards.Taking a couple of examples, a citizen in Kalgoorlie had a number of faults on his line. Due to mismanagement problems in Telstra, the fault was not fixed on time and he was paid over $100 under the government's customer service guarantee. Interestingly, a citizen in Clovelly, which I understand is just jogging distance from the central business district - so you would think Telstra would fix that fairly quickly - requested a phone service from Telstra on 19 May 1999. Because of infrastructure capacity problems, Telstra had to install a new cable in the street and did not connect until 1 September. That customer was paid $1,700 under the government's customer service guarantee. This government has acted in the interests of consumers and customers and will continue to do so. </DOC>

 - I am happy to take up that matter on behalf of the local member. It is a pity she did not come to us beforehand. I might be wrong but I think she is trying to make political capital out of this issue. It is very mischievous, if that is the case. Of course, you belong to a party that opposed the part privatisation of Telstra, which allowed us to inject hundreds of millions of dollars into upgrading rural, regional and remote telephone and telecommunication services. And we are keeping at it. Above all, at the last election your party had a policy of repealing or abolishing Networking the Nation. Not only did you not support us in our capital upgrade of the telecommunications sector in rural Australia; you actually had a policy to repeal the funding.My answer to the member would include that the customer service guarantee is working. I should give you this information. I know you will be interested. Telstra has reported that from March 1998 to December 1999, as Col Cooper or Len Cooper - one of the Coopers - has claimed, standards have improved. -  - Yes - another dynasty within the trade union movement. He will end up in parliament in that case. I am advised by Telstra that over that period March 1998 to December 1999, from 88 to 98 per cent of remote customers were connected, from 97 to 99 per cent of customers in minor rural centres were connected and from 84 to 86 per cent of rural faults were repaired. We will keep the pressure on Telstra to deliver even better performances.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He was with me in Rockhampton, which just happens to be in the electorate of the person who asked the previous question. This happens to be a bit of very good news indeed for Rockhampton. I am not quite certain why she did not ask the question. The federal government has committed itself to a range of very important programs in the member for Capricornia's electorate including a massive upgrading of the national highway grid just north of the town of Longreach. If we are talking about what we are delivering for Longreach, the replacement of the Thompson River bridge and all the roadworks that go with it at many tens of millions of dollars of expense is something else that we could refer to.The federal government has contributed $7 million towards the lengthening of Rockhampton's airport. It will have a very substantial positive effect on local employment and on export opportunities. The runway has been extended from 1,980 metres to 2,630 metres. We opened it last Friday. By July, the next stage of the program, a strengthening of the runway, will also be completed. I am sure this is of particular interest to the member for Capricornia. It is believed that this will generate another 400 jobs and provide an annual $40 million boost to the local economy. The upgrade will enable the airport to handle Boeing 747s and heavily laden Boeing 767s. It will position Rockhampton to become the main staging point for international military exercises conducted at Shoalwater Bay.Another very important point, in terms of the government's ongoing reform program, is that this upgrade will enable Rockhampton to tap into opportunities that are being opened up by the government's new international aviation policy. Under that policy, foreign air carriers will have unrestricted access to regional international airports such as Rockhampton. As a result, that city, the region and the country communities around it will have the opportunity to gain direct access to overseas markets. This level of cooperation between the Rockhampton City Council and the federal government is a welcome change. It is worth noting that, just 70 years ago this month, the city council approached the then federal government, looking for assistance for an airport. It was not forthcoming. The city council had to say no to someone called Hudson Fysh from Longreach, who offered to run a tiger moth service between the two cities if the Rockhampton City Council would build an airport. That was not forthcoming. It has to be said that Mr Fysh took his knockback very well. His little company, Qantas, now flies to 108 destinations in 32 countries. This airport project has been organised much better than 70 years ago. I believe it is very firm testimony to our commitment to rural and regional Australia and ought to be welcomed by everyone in the House, not least the member for Capricornia. </DOC>

 - Once again the opposition show they do not understand the system. In fact, two reports have been released today. The first is the Serious risk report, which was reported by the agency to the department. The delegate of the secretary of the department then considered that report and made a decision and sanctions were in fact applied on 22 February. There were press releases put out to that effect. There was a lot of discussion about it. Indeed, there were conditions put in place which were not in fact followed. There is an unwillingness by the Labor Party to understand that the mess that they left behind had to be cleaned up. By following the legislation we have put in place, we have closed this home down. On the one hand you say we should do this and in the very next breath you say the opposite. Speaking out of both sides of your mouth, you say, `Yes, you should close it,' and then, `No, you should not.' Flip, flop, flip, flop Beazley - that is your name. Make up your mind.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and I know the great commitment she has to improving the lives and standards of young people in her area. Members of this House are aware that the New South Wales government has capitulated to the campaign of the New South Wales Teachers Federation and has abandoned the year 7 literacy test this year. During that campaign they had no support from the Leader of the Opposition. He said nothing whatsoever during this entire campaign against the neediest students in New South Wales and the right of parents to accountability. He has never had any interest in education. He had no interest when he was the minister: he wanted to be back in the Defence portfolio. He deliberately shut off and went to sleep for two years. `No tanks, no thanks' was his attitude to education. He just did not want it. The issue, however, extends beyond the year 7 test, because New South Wales is now the only state in Australia not to have lodged the results for the year 3 reading assessments against the national benchmarks. It is time that Bob Carr and John Aquilina practised what they preached and released these results. I call on the New South Wales government today to release these results so that the New South Wales education system can be properly accountable for their teaching of literacy skills to young Australians in New South Wales and so that the parents can be properly informed.  I was asked whether I was aware of any alternative policies. The Australian Labor Party at the federal level is some 12 years behind in this area. The furthest they have been able to come is to support basic skills testing, which was introduced in 1989. The member for Werriwa was unduly optimistic when he told the Leader of the Opposition they were 10 years behind - they are 12 years behind. - The Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no commitment to literacy benchmark testing and no commitment to the publication of results. This literacy benchmark testing is the most important equity issue in Australian education today. It has been fought inch by inch by the Australian Education Union, arm in arm with its comrades the Australian Labor Party. Kim Beazley and Shazza have marched hand in hand, arm in arm, in opposition to the national literacy benchmark. They are the two amigos of education. They have aligned themselves against proper accountability to Australian parents for the literacy performance of Australian education systems. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to break this crashing silence and to start to commit the Labor Party to support for proper literacy testing, for publication of those results and for accountability of education systems for those results, and to make it clear that they are on the side of Australian parents, not against them as they are at the present time.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, they still don't understand, do they? The fact of the matter is that there were three reports. The first one -  -   - As I said, they really don't understand, do they? The third report was in fact released on the day that the evacuation of residents began and was the report upon which the decision of the delegate was made to indeed revoke licences and to revoke provider status. That was released by the delegate pursuant to the power within the legislation so that the public - that is, the residents - would know the basis of the closure of the Riverside home. There were three reports: one serious risk report, one review audit report -  - The report, as I told you, was made to the delegate and I saw the report after the sanctions on 22 February were in fact put in place, as is proper because there must not be political interference with the decision making processes of the delegate. Following my concern, which I have expressed in this House, I asked the department to write to the Federal Police and refer the matter to them.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity to answer the member for Dawson's question seeking some information about the nature of population growth in Australia and also some of the various options that might flow from that. Currently Australia has a net permanent migration of between 60,000 and 70,000 people per year and a birthrate of 1.75 children per fertile couple. It ought to be clear to all members that a birthrate of 1.75 children per fertile couple in fact leads inevitably to a decline in the Australian population born here. On plausible assumptions about future migration and fertility levels, we are heading towards a population of around 23 million in 2050, and that is stabilising in size and age structure. If you had any modest increase in the intake, it would have only a marginal impact on the projections I have just given to you. However, some - and it was given credence by the Leader of the Opposition in his earlier interjection - seem to be of a view that we should have a population policy. Population policy is clearly code - either it is code for a significant increase in the size of the immigration program or it is code for eliminating the immigration program. There are some people, in industry for instance, who argue that we should have a one per cent increase in population as a result of migration. Some people argue that proposition, and the opposition gives credence to business when it goes out there suggesting that those sorts of projections ought to be accepted.The fact is that a one per cent increase in our population would mean an immigration program of 180,000 people a year. The projections make it very clear that, by the middle of this century, you would have 360,000 people entering through an immigration program or, at the end of the century, you would have 65 million people, if those were the propositions being put. I hear a great deal of comment by the opposition which suggests that they see that that sort of suggestion ought to have little credibility. Equally, if you argue that you should have a reduced population - there are some people who used to argue that we should have net zero migration - net zero migration would lead to a declining population after about 20 years, and you would see the population decline by the end of the century to 14 million, and it would be in perpetual decline.We have an opposition that is out there suggesting that it can propose all answers to all people. It wants to suggest that it can have, for some, a smaller immigration program. If you listen to the member for Batman, he is hinting at maybe a larger immigration program. If you are going to have a population policy, you either accept the inevitable outcome of the programs that are in place now or go out and argue for something different. We have seen an abysmal failure of the Leader of the Opposition to be able to argue anything different, to be able to put any proposals on the table to tell us what the opposition would do if it had to plan in this area. It needs to make it clear whether it is prepared to accept the programs that are in place or whether it is prepared to have the courage to go out and argue for a separate and different set of policies. Otherwise, you will inevitably be seen as the weak leader that everybody on this side recognises you are.</DOC>

 - Today, because of the typically misleading statements made by the Labor Party, I put a full and comprehensive answer down to a question which explained precisely the mechanisms that had been gone through in accordance with the Aged Care Act. I said it had been done in accordance with legal advice right throughout. With all the hyperbole that comes from the Labor Party, where is their policy? Let me say that Senator Evans has had this to say -   - Not only do they not have a policy, as evidenced by Senator Evans, but, as I have carefully explained so that even the Leader of the Opposition can understand it, the report was handed to the delegate of the secretary, not to the minister. I do wish you would understand. You really cannot be that thick. - To the contrary, maybe you can be that thick. After all, this is what your spokesman said. - My colleague the Treasurer says I should use words of one syllable for your benefit. - Senator Evans said, `We should drive out industry rogue providers, those who are not prepared to meet the high standards set by the new accreditation system.' That is our policy. He then went on, and let us see if we could find what yours was. Here we found it. He said, `I say at the outset -  - Just to conclude, Senator Evans says that he believes that there will always be rogue providers but he guesses that to some extent they will always be there. Not under our policy. That may be their policy, but our policy is to use the power under the act.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I think the House would know only too well that this government is deeply committed to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and few Australians will forget the way this government brought to life the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1996. Indeed, it stands as one of our, and for that matter our part of the world's, great achievements in the area of nuclear non-proliferation. Yesterday it was with great pleasure that I signed the agreement with the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty organisation, Dr Hoffmann, to facilitate the establishment and management of nuclear test monitoring stations in Australia. In this country we will be hosting around 20 monitoring stations, which is more than any other country in the world except for the United States and Russia. That represents a very substantial and practical contribution to the verification of the treaty - in other words, to our broader national commitment to stopping future tests by nuclear weapon states and nuclear threshold states. The honourable member asks me whether there are any alternative policies. I thought the House might be interested to know that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs is soon to attend a seminar on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control issues. Members of the House may expect him to attend a seminar in, for example, the United States, given the alliance relationship between Australia and the United States, or in a country like France or Britain - nuclear weapon states but countries which have a slightly different perspective from the United States. But no; the member for Kingsford-Smith is going to attend a seminar on nuclear non-proliferation in New Zealand, which apparently is now going to be the source of policy advice on nuclear issues for the Australian Labor Party. I am not sure whether this has been cleared with the Leader of the Opposition, who has a longstanding commitment to the American alliance, but it sounds as though right behind his back a new policy is emerging that the Labor Party is taking up where the Lange government left off.</DOC>

 - In relation to the matter that was referred to the Australian Federal Police, it was the review audit report that was referred to the Australian Federal Police, which is the report that contains the findings that are in the first risk audit report. Quite frankly, it was my request to the department to write to the Australian Federal Police in accordance with the letter that has been in fact released, and I have made a full statement here today which I would refer you to so that you can properly inform yourself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is estimated that some 20 per cent of Australians in any one year will suffer some degree of depression. In 1997 the Australian Bureau of Statistics carried out a survey of mental health and wellbeing which found that some 800,000 Australians a year have depression serious enough to be called a depressive illness. Depression accounts for around 25 per cent of years lived with a disability. To put that into some context, if you compare it in the work force to days lost for industrial disputes, there are as many days lost through depressive illness in a fortnight in Australia as there are through industrial disputes in any 12-month period.Australia is not alone here. The World Health Organisation estimates that by the year 2020 depression will be the second major burden of illness in industrialised countries, second only to heart disease. The government has had a number of initiatives over the past four years in this area, but I am pleased to inform the House of one that I announced in Melbourne this morning. It is called the National Depression Initiative, and the Commonwealth will be giving $3½ million a year over a five-year period initially, and we will be seeking matching contributions from state and territory governments and from business organisations. The partnerships in this are essential for it to work and to work successfully.We have taken the model of the National Breast Cancer Centre, which was started in 1995 and has proved successful in changing attitudes to, and the treatment of, breast cancer. We are hoping that the National Depression Initiative will similarly lead to greater community awareness, a reduction in stigma, best practice guidelines and significant work with general practitioners, who are usually the first port of call for treatment, and will focus our national research effort on answering the questions that particularly apply to this country. I announced this morning that the chairman of this initiative would be the former Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. He showed considerable courage and leadership in raising this as an issue. While we have not always agreed on a lot of issues in health care, we felt that this was far more important than any previous political history, and we are highly optimistic that state and territory governments will similarly put this above party politics. He is being joined in the initial scoping by Professor Harvey Whiteford from the University of Queensland, who is a consultant to the World Bank on mental health issues, and John McGrath, who is chairman of the Mental Health Council of Australia, the national peak consumer group.I am enormously optimistic that, in the medium term, initiatives such as this will very dramatically change the way we look at and treat mental illness in Australia and will give many hundreds of thousands of Australians great hope.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. As always, the member for La Trobe expresses the concerns of the average Australian. The average Australian is interested in benefits for their family, and there are many benefits of government policy for Australian families. The first and most important benefit is that we have provided Australian families with more jobs. We have provided them with more than 650,000 jobs over the last four years. Not only have we got more people into work but the people we have got into work are earning more money.I would not be the least bit surprised if the Treasurer were asked about the national accounts later today. Maybe the shadow Treasurer will give the bloke a break and ask him a question. As the national accounts reveal, one of the things that is underpinning the continuing strength of the Australian economy is the rise in disposable incomes of Australian families - there are more people in work and there have been real wage rises. Under the coalition, real wages have grown at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent. Under 13 years of Labor, the average annual increase in real wages was barely anything - it was 0.3 per cent - so there has, by comparison, been a massive rise in real wages under this government. But it does not stop there. We also have the benefits of lower interest rates - $266 a month the average Australian family is better off as a result of lower interest rates. Despite the attempts of the Labor Party to stop the income tax cuts coming in on 1 July, and despite the unwillingness of the Leader of the Opposition to rule out an increase in income tax on Australian families if he were ever to become Prime Minister of Australia, I have more good news for Australian families. On 1 July, Australian families will enjoy the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history. Australian families will share in a cut in income tax worth $12 billion. But that is not the end of it. In addition to the personal income tax cuts, there is $2.5 billion of increased family benefits. The average family will receive a tax cut of $47 a week after factoring in the goods and services tax. The situation will be that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 per cent - in other words, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will know that no matter how much harder they work, and no matter how much more income they earn, the rate they pay on that marginal dollar can never be more than 30 cents. That is a truly historic reform, which says to the great bulk of Australian taxpayers: you can lift your incomes quite dramatically, but you do not go into a higher tax bracket. That will restore a massive amount of incentive.I say to the member for La Trobe: you are quite right to ask me about the application of government policies for Australian families. It has been our determination over the last four years to act in the interests of all Australian families. I am proud to say to the House that, of all of the things this government has achieved, there are none more significant than the enormous benefits we have delivered to average families throughout the length and breadth of our nation.</DOC>

 - I do, I do, I do. I thank the honourable member for Perth. I do remember very clearly saying that - a long time ago. I certainly do remember that commitment, and let me calmly say, for the benefit of the parliament and particularly for the benefit of those members - all of whom sit behind me - who are interested in service levels for regional Australia: the government's policy has always been that the sale of the rest of Telstra is conditional on there being this transparent public inquiry and that transparent public inquiry reporting that there has been adequate delivery according to set criteria of service levels. I will need to check with my office and with the minister, but my recollection - and I cannot at this stage, for obvious reasons, put it stronger than that without checking - is as follows: we presented a bill to the parliament seeking sanction for the full sale of Telstra. It contained a provision for the establishment of this inquiry. That bill in that form was rejected in the Senate, including with the votes of the Australian Labor Party. As a consequence of that, we went back to the Senate and secured the passage of a bill to sell up to another 16-odd per cent, again in the teeth of opposition from the Australian Labor Party - these people who always say one thing in opposition and do the completely opposite thing when they are in government. It remains the case that our policy is that the rest of Telstra will be sold subject to that public inquiry, and there will be an announcement made about that inquiry.  The appropriate nature of this question from the member for Perth grows on me every minute, because there is going to be an announcement made by the relevant minister within the next few days about the terms of reference of the inquiry and the personnel to be on that inquiry. As I said, I will check my recollection because I do not pretend to carry all of these things around in my head - but that is my recollection. Our position is very clear. We are not hypocrites on the issue of privatisation, unlike those who sit opposite. We all remember those ringing commitments that were made to the Australian people by the Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments about how they would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank. I remember being rung up by him when I was in opposition and being asked for opposition support to get a privatisation proposal through the Senate. They were begging for the support of the Liberal and National parties for a privatisation proposal. It is even better than that, though, from a point of view of demonstrating the charge of hypocrisy, particularly against the Leader of the Opposition. Ever since Telstra made the announcement last week, the Leader of the Opposition has been in front of every microphone that will come to a stop in front of him. He has been talking into every single microphone in Australia saying, `This is outrageous. There are going to be jobs lost if Telstra is allowed to do what it wants to do.' I might remind the Leader of the Opposition of a speech he made to parliament on 4 June 1992. He was waxing eloquent about his role in economic reform in Australia.  - The Treasurer tempts me. He says he was being prolix about his role in economic reform. The Leader of the Opposition said this:I will point out one of the fundamental elements of restructuring ... There is one essential accompaniment to restructuring. Almost invariably where there are changes to work practices, where industrial efficiencies are introduced, there will be redundancies. We cannot escape that. That is an inevitable consequence of structural change. We cannot run away from that. That was a fair statement. What is not fair, what is hypocritical, what is duplicitous and what represents the absolute policy bankruptcy of the Leader of the Opposition is that having had the responsibility of government, and knowing that to be a reality, he still pretends to the Australian people that you can have the sort of economic change that is occurring, particularly in the communications sector, without some job implications. I do not pretend to the Australian people, I do not try to walk both sides of the street, I do not try to be all things to all men on this issue. What I am trying to do is to point out - and I know those opposite do not like this because it reminds them of the sheer policy bankruptcy of the man who leads them - that it reminds the Australian people that, on this particular issue, he is playing fast and loose not only with the truth but with policy reality. The communications sector, which the national accounts figures released today demonstrate is one of the fastest, if not the fastest, growing areas of the Australian economy, is an area where the sort of changes contemplated are unavoidable. Nobody likes it. The good thing is that we have generated a climate where people who may be redundant in one part of that industry sector can get a job elsewhere. I would remind the parliament that when Mr Beazley made that statement in June of 1992, the unemployment rate in Australia was massively above what it is now, and the climate for people who are made redundant is infinitely better now than what it was. On this issue, as on so many, the Leader of the Opposition is without policy credibility. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The national accounts, which were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the December quarter this year, show that Australia is a high growth, low inflation economy. The Australian economy continues to perform strongly by world standards, recording a solid one per cent growth in the December quarter and 4.3 per cent through the year. In terms of inflation, the consumption deflator increased by just 0.9 per cent through the year. What that shows is that the Australian economy has now grown at above four per cent for the last 11 consecutive quarters - a growth rate unrivalled in the last 30 years. The Australian economy has grown at or above four per cent for the last 11 consecutive quarters - a growth rate which is unrivalled in the last 30 years. There was nothing like it in the nineties, the eighties or indeed the seventies. That indicates the strength of the economy and the capacity to produce jobs. Last month we had 50,000 new jobs. When this government was elected in March 1996, unemployment was 8.6 per cent and now it is 6.7 per cent. At a growth rate of four per cent per annum, unemployment reduces at about half a percentage point per annum. If we were to keep the Australian economy growing at four per cent, you would expect the unemployment rate to reduce about half a per cent per annum for as long as that growth continued. Because the national accounts came out today, you might have expected that the shadow Treasurer would ask me a question about them. He did have a question but not to me, and its subject matter was not the national accounts. We are still waiting for the shadow Treasurer to make his first speech on macroeconomic policy. He is yet to make a speech on macroeconomic policy. His record of speeches on macroeconomic issues looks a bit like the Leader of the Opposition's tax policy - a blank sheet on both sides. He is still to ask his first question. He was auditioning before the News Ltd editors in Sydney last night - and modesty prevents me from telling him how he went - but he is yet to make his first speech on the economy. There would be a lot of Labor backbenchers who would not realise how unusual it is to have somebody in a position like this who has not had an economic thought for the period that he has held the office. The member for Werriwa said it before: change is hard. To actually support a policy - to be able to do more than cheapjack opportunist, populist sloganeering - you have to actually take a stand, you have to actually do something. The shadow Treasurer's contribution to tax policy, as I recall, was his big claim before the 1996 election that he was going to take the Toorak tractor off the road, which he decided after the election was a bad policy and he abandoned it immediately. - What was he? Lucky that he didn't get elected. So the one policy that he had was the wrong one. The Labor Party is yet to make a statement on economic policy. It is the big reforms over the last four years - the changing of monetary policy, the balancing of the budget, the changes in relation to tax reform - that are setting Australia up for the growth opportunities that Australia deserves. We have seen unemployment fall by two percentage points under the policies of this government, and if we continue with economic reform they can fall further. They are the benefits for Australians from good policy. That is why the government's policy for economic reform should be supported in this parliament and should proceed.  </DOC>

 - I have not heard those allegations, and I am not going to accept them on face value here this afternoon. Neither am I going to be put in a position of defending Telstra's performance in rural and regional areas because, as we have claimed, we believe that they ought to lift their game. The member for Batman says that they are going to look after the interests of the bush and give it a voice because they are going to look after Telstra and Australia Post. They are the people who closed 270 post offices around Australia, the people who did away with analogue phones, the people who did nothing about a customer service guarantee -  - Whilst the Labor Party makes these claims, to be fair and objective about this, the member for Calare, in good faith, asked me some questions about call centres last week, and I added to my answer. In that I actually quoted the CEO of Telstra, who made it quite plain that, in relation to call centres, there are a number of very good reasons why Telstra might very well locate more, not less, jobs in rural and regional Australia - to which I say, `Amen; you've got it right, and we would like to see some action on it.' Finally, the member for Dickson, in some extraordinary leap of faith, implies that I have given some personal guarantee. She misses the point. The guarantees that we have put in place are set in legislation. They are not mine; they are in legislation, which I would have thought was far more robust and of far more value to rural and regional Australia. I can only conclude by saying: (a) you have no credibility on this; and (b) you are plainly more interested in scaremongering than in addressing the real issue, which is services in rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and -  - I am quite happy to talk to him about petrol prices because I believe he is a service station operator and he has taken a great interest in the industry. The price of petrol in Australia is governed by world oil prices and by retail and transport costs. Approximately 60 per cent of Australia's oil is imported but all of the oil, domestic and import, is set at a world price. The reason for that is that the oil price is in a global market and is set by global factors. The benchmark West Texas intermediate crude, which was at about an average of $12 per barrel in February 1999, went to $21 a barrel in August 1999, $27 in January this year and is now averaging around $30 in March, which is almost a tripling of the price of crude oil over the course of the year from February 1999. As a consequence of that, petrol prices have increased.  - In relation to excise, because I hear a question from one of the Labor frontbenchers in relation to excise: excise on fuel is indexed. That was a system which was introduced by the Hawke government in 1983 and has never been opposed by any member of the Labor Party. - To my knowledge, after 13 years of imposing it neither the member for Hunter nor his father ever voiced one day's objection to that system. But of course not only did the petrol excise go up as a consequence of indexation; petrol excises were also increased by the Labor Party as a matter of discretion. - In 1983 - 1.87c per litre increase, discretionary; budget increase in 1986 of 3c; another budget increase in 1993 of 3c; another budget increase in 1994 of, I believe, one cent; and another one in 1995. So the Labor Party was legislating to increase the excises and, because they had indexation in place, those increases fitted into the CPI and indexed it up in addition. This government, unlike its predecessor, has never increased petrol excise as discretionary budget increases. In fact, this government has legislated, as part of its new tax package, to actually reduce excise, and it will be, on the costings in ANTS, reducing petrol excise to the order of $1.2 billion - although the actual reduction will be set closer to the time - with reductions in diesel of around $0.7 billion. So this government is the first government that has ever proposed reductions in petrol excise. The Labor Party not only put the excise up but also used that to feed into indexation. The consequence of that reduction in excise is that to the consumer the price will be equalised back with the goods and services tax, but to business and anybody who is entitled to an input tax credit it actually amounts to a 10 per cent cut in the price of petrol. So, for farmers and other people in business that are using cars in the course of their business, the consequence of that is that petrol will actually become 10 per cent cheaper.I have noticed that there has been some criticism of the indexation system. There were some stories today making the false claim - incidentally, in one of the Fairfax papers today - that the government was not reducing excise on petrol - it is, as I indicated before - and saying that indexation would drive up the price. I make this point: the indexation system, which has been in place since the Labor Party introduced it, has always worked off the consumer price index. Obviously, the best way to minimise the effect of indexation is to have a lower consumer price index. - Under the Australian Labor Party, the consumer price index increased by an average of 5.2 per cent per annum -  - whereas under this government it has been 1.1. - So, Mr Speaker, the member for Hunter should explain why they were discretionary increasing - that is, legislating to increase it in budgets but pushing it up 5.2 per cent on 5.2 per cent on 5.2 per cent per annum over the course of 13 years. Under this government, by doing it at 1.1 per cent, there has been of course an enormous benefit for petrol buyers. I make the point that I see that some of the lobbyists for some of the motoring organisations have a campaign against indexation, which I suppose is fair enough from their point of view. But the government has always indicated that it would keep the system of indexation. We do it for this reason: we index the excise on petrol because we index pensions and other benefits. The motoring organisations who complain about indexing in relation to petrol may well explain to their members, particularly pensioners, why, if they are against indexation, they think pensioners should not have increases in their pension in line with the CPI. Obviously, if you are going to have increases in pensions, family allowances and all other government benefits in response to price rises, the revenues that are going to pay for that should also move in line with price rises. That is the other half of the story that the lobbyists of the motoring organisations are not telling their members. They are not telling their pensioners that, if it were the case that the excise did not stay in proportion to the price of the product, the government would not be in the position to make sure the spending power of the pensions kept proportion with the cost rises that those pensioners have to pay and that people on family allowances and other benefits have to pay. On this side of the House, we think it is important that pensions keep pace with inflation. In fact, on this side of the House we think it is important that they go in front of inflation, which is why we are increasing pensions by four per cent on 1 July. Obviously, to pay for that you need a revenue base which grows in proportion to the economy. One of the ways that pensions will be funded in the future is with a goods and services tax which will grow in line with the economy. If we were not to broaden the base of the indirect taxes, we would not be in a position to pay those benefits. That is why the Labor Party in its opposition to GST has also been opposing increases in pensions and why it would have no basis to pay for increased family benefits if it were not to take the benefit of the tax reform from this government.</DOC>

 - What the government has done is introduce a First Home Owners Scheme for people who have not previously owned homes. The reason for that is that, if you own a current home and the price of housing goes up, you will get the benefit of that in relation to your house. If you are not in the market, you will not get it. So the government, as part of its policy, has decided to fund a First Home Owners Scheme. I am pleased to say that nobody has extolled the benefits of the First Home Owners Scheme more than the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania, Dr David Crean, who is putting out press releases boasting about the wonderful policy of the First Home Owners Scheme. I do thank Dr Crean for extolling the benefits of our policy which will protect first home owners. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. All the Victorian members, with all the other members in the House, would be pleased to see the numbers that came out today on GDP. - It is a great testament to the leadership -  - Today's GDP numbers give us confidence in the reform program that the government has put in place. I am sure I am one of many who want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the work that they have done. As a Victorian, however, I am concerned to see developments in Victoria which show you what happens when you get a Labor government. This was very clear in the survey results that were out this week in the Melbourne Herald Sun under the title `Projects slump as confidence takes a dive'. This is directly attributable to the Labor government's actions - or inaction - in Victoria and, in particular, to the fact that they are under the thumb of the unions, as the Leader of the Opposition federally would be under the thumb of the unions if ever he were elected. As one of the principal operators in the building industry said in the Herald Sun this week: This is the worst it has been for about a decade. There is not a lot of big projects floating around. He went on to say: A client would have to have rocks in their head putting something out for tender now. That is what you get when you get a Labor government that is under the thumb of militant trade union leaders, as is happening in Victoria today. As Nicole Feeley, the head of a Victorian employers association, said in regard to a survey: Victoria cannot afford to slide. You lose six months now and it takes 12 months to recover. Or, as the CEO of the retailers association said: I have to question whether the confidence of six months ago is here.The reason for this deteriorating state of circumstances in Victoria is quite simple to see, and that is that we have had the election of a Labor government and, sadly, the unions are running amok. Martin Kingham, the head of the building workers in Victoria, said last year that, come the early part of this year, there would be industrial warfare, and the Labor Party failed to stand up to him and tell him that it was unacceptable to be putting Victorian jobs and investment at risk. The other interesting reflection on the federal opposition from what is going on at the state level is the state of confusion. If you listen to the Labor Party, my opposite number in the federal parliament says that I am the most interventionist minister of all time, yet the state minister is saying, `Where are you?' - Exactly. Thank you for the interjection. One minute I am too interventionist, the next minute it is, `Where are you? You ought to be intervening.' - And then the state leader, just like you -  - Mr Speaker, you give him a lot more latitude than his union masters do, I can tell you that. The state Premier in Victoria says, `If only we had a system of arbitration, which I am going to set up, then we would be able to manage the building industry in Victoria.' Yet, when the matter was before the federal commission yesterday, the Victorians did not turn up. Why didn't they turn up? Because the union said, `We don't want arbitration because we would never get a 36-hour week if the matter went to arbitration.' It is hypocrisy upon hypocrisy. In the end the reality is, at the state level as it is at the federal level, that when it comes to policy you do what the unions tell you to do, and the people who suffer are the average people who want a job. The average worker who wants to get on and build Victoria is jeopardised and put at disadvantage by your close relationship with the unions. Australia is going well because this government acts in the national interest. If Labor were in power federally, you would get exactly the same as you have got with a weak state leader in Victoria. </DOC>

 - Have I seen the NFF submission to the national wage case? No. I do not write the NFF submission, nor do they send it to me for checking. I have actually read the ACTU submission, which described Australia as a high growth, low inflation economy and said -  - Well, I agree with the ACTU on the point. Presumably you would too. They are your masters. - I was asked whether I had seen the National Farmers Federation submission to the national wage case, and I say that I have not. The question then included a long quote, including compliance costs, and finishes off with a somewhat rhetorical flourish about compensation for tax changes. I would have thought that this government has provided compensation, and not just compensation but benefits, arising from tax changes which are unrivalled in Australian history. When Labor was putting up wholesale sales taxes, there was no compensation. When Labor was putting up petrol excise, there was no compensation. What this government does is it introduces goods and services tax, abolishes wholesale sales tax, cuts income taxes by $12 billion, increases pensions in advance of inflation, guarantees to keep them in advance of the CPI, increases the level of family allowances, increases rent assistance by seven per cent, increases all allowances under the social security regime, cuts the company tax, halves capital gains tax and introduces a simplified taxation system. At the end of all of that, the Labor Party is so opposed to the goods and services tax that if they ever get elected they plan to keep it. When the Leader of the Opposition got up last night to speak to the Irish Prime Minister, I gave him a challenge. He should have said, `Taoiseach, you are wrong about goods and services tax. Europe is wrong, Germany is wrong, France is wrong and England is wrong. Taoiseach, what you need is a wholesale sales tax, thought up by the modern thinkers of the Australian Labor Party.' I said yesterday that it was an oxymoron to be a Labor thinker. </DOC>

 - The establishment of the national literacy standards, which all education systems are expected to meet, has been essential to deal with the massive literacy problem left by the Labor Party after 13 years in office. Members of this House will have noted that a number of the states are now releasing the results of these benchmark assessments and there was significant comment on these results in the press this morning. These standards are the key to the most important equity policy in Australian education today. If you do not support national standards, if you do not support the publication of results, you are simply not serious in addressing the literacy problem in this country. The Labor Party has not committed itself to the standards and has not committed itself to the publication of these benchmark results. There are two essential elements to the national benchmarks which define the national literacy standards. One is that they define the literacy levels which a child will need in order to successfully complete their education.  - The Leader of the Opposition is not interested in empowering parents to act so as to cope with literacy problems faced by their child. When the Leader of the Opposition was in office, 30 per cent of young people in Australia could not read and write properly. What did the Leader of the Opposition do about it? Did he observe that there was a problem? No, he said, `I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than in just about any I have had.' Thirty per cent of young people could not read and write properly and the Leader of the Opposition could not think of anything to do about it. He went to sleep for two years. What an extraordinary record we have here. We have a leader who did nothing in a key portfolio when he had the opportunity. At the last election, he brought out an education policy which was so bad that the shadow minister resigned.  - Mr Speaker, the very point I am making is that the Leader of the Opposition failed, when he was minister, to publish the results of literacy tests when they were available and thus deprived parents of -  - One can understand their sensitivity on this point because the record is abysmal. When the Leader of the Opposition was the minister, when he was wanting to be defence minister but just happened to be education minister, he sat on the results of literacy tests year after year, in partnership with the Australian Education Union, and failed to publish the results of those tests so that parents could take appropriate action. - Parents are entitled to information about the performance of their children. It has been that lack of information available to parents for such a long time that has allowed the literacy problem to persist in this country. It is only the national standards established by this government in conjunction with the states which have put parents in a position where they can go to schools and begin to ask, `Where is my child in relation to the national standard? What action are you taking to make sure my child is at the national standard?' I was asked whether there were any alternative policies and what the implications of these were. I am drawing a comparison with the lack of policy on the other side of the House. The Labor Party's consistent policy on this, in conjunction with the Australian Education Union, was to conceal the results of literacy tests from parents. And they have still not committed themselves to the publication of these results.Today we see the Australian Education Union in the media urging that the national benchmark be shunted to one side and saying that the unions and the Labor Party would put in place a new policy framework that would, once again, conceal information from parents. We have a disastrous record of disadvantaging and disempowering parents, which has led to the persistence of a long, serious literacy problem in this country. When the Leader of the Opposition put forward an alternative at the last election, he devoted four lines to the question of literacy, and the policy was so bad that his shadow minister resigned from it. When he attempt-ed, in the last fortnight, to set out some edu-ca-tional targets and goals for Aust-ralia, he tripped over himself, contradicted himself and contradicted his shadow minister - a move-ment from one bungle to another. There is no policy on the other side of the House. He is the Frank Spencer of education policy. Some mothers do `ave `em, and we are certainly not going to get anything better from that side. </DOC>

 - As is my custom in these matters, I will check all of the sources quoted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is no secret - and the Treasurer and I have certainly been making this plain - that, because of the service component to draught beer, there will be a higher price rise for a glass of beer across the counter. We have never disguised that. My recollection is that, some weeks ago, I mentioned on the 7.30 Report a figure of seven per cent.  - And the Treasurer said it on Laws. That is a double for you if ever there was one: the Prime Minister on the 7.30 Report and the Treasurer on Laws. As far as the election campaign is concerned, my recollection is that I was asked some questions about this. I made it clear, certainly in the context of the question I was asked on the Kempsey bottle shop - Mr O'Brien had a bundle of faxes in front of him and he asked me a number of questions - that there was 1.9 per cent on packaged beer. I will check all of the records. - The Treasurer and I have been making it very plain that there is a difference. The reason there is a difference is that there is a service component in draught beer served across the counter. We have had extensive discussions with the brewing industry about this. They wanted us to change it; they wanted us to give them a concession. We took the view that we were not able to do that. The price of a glass of beer across the counter will rise by a higher factor than packaged beer. Packaged beer will on average rise by around 1.9 per cent or two per cent. That was made clear in the document released by the Treasurer and me before the election campaign. I would point out to the public and to the House that drinkers, along with all other sections of the Australian community, will enjoy very significant tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to inform the honourable member that there has been a remarkable response to the government's program of arranging seminars for farmers to explain the new tax system. Indeed, most of the seminars are heavily booked, and I have been pleased to announce in the last couple of days that we will provide for an additional 284 seminars across four states. Indeed, in your own state of New South Wales, we will be doubling the number of seminars to be conducted to 284. Across Australia there will be 1,578 seminars and workshops - that is just for farmers - to help explain the new tax system, providing around 75,000 places.These seminars are being organised by farm organisations on behalf of the government - farmers explaining to farmers how the new tax system will work in language and with illustrations and examples that are familiar to them and that they can readily understand. They are able to sweep away some of the nonsense and the scare tactics that we have been hearing from the other side, explain the way the new tax system will work and provide opportunities for farmers to understand both their obligations and the benefits of the system to them when it begins on 1 July. There will also be 23 seminars for fishing and 15 for forestry.  These seminars are being held in almost every country town right across Australia. Farmers are keen to learn about the new system. They know that there is around $1 billion worth of tax savings for them and the removal of their costs. They know they will be paying less income tax. Three-quarters of all farmers will be paying 17 cents in the dollar or less. They are keen to learn about the abolition of the wholesale sales tax system, the cheaper rail freight, the lower transport costs and the improvements in Australia's export competitiveness. They want the facts because there has been so much scaremongering. We listened just before question time to the honourable member for Paterson advocating the ALP's roll-back policy - wanting to roll back these benefits to farmers so that they would not be able to benefit from the new system. He wanted to roll it all the way back to Swaziland and Botswana. He was lecturing the parliament about how Swaziland and Botswana had a better economy than anybody else's.  - The honourable member for Paterson. That was his example of where he wants Australia to go. Fortunately, farmers have higher ambitions. They want the advantage of a modern tax system so they can compete effectively with other countries around the world where farmers have not had to endure Australia's archaic tax system as they attempt to fight on tough export markets. These new seminars will help ensure that farmers are well equipped for the new tax system when it begins on 1 July. </DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the member for Pearce and indeed the House that today Senator Newman and I launched the public information campaign for families and those receiving income support. Beginning today, millions of Australians will start to receive information from us, through the letter box, through the weekend papers and through television campaigns, about the benefits of the new tax system. This mail-out will go, over the next two months, to 2.2 million Australians households who will benefit under these new changes - households right around the country, and even in Dubbo. I welcome the Mayor of Dubbo and his general manager here today. This very presentable, very informative 20-page booklet will explain why we are simplifying 12 payments into three payments, and the enhanced pay rates -   - Yes. And the enhanced pay rates are even for the constituents in Paterson. More than 90 per cent of Australians with dependent children will be receiving increased payments from 1 July. As the Prime Minister has very accurately articulated today, this means substantial increases through personal income tax cuts. Eighty per cent of Australians will pay no more than 30 per cent tax. We have increases in pensions and allowances. We have increases in family payments, with more generous income test rules. We have increases in child-care assistance, particularly to low income families, and major benefits to older Australians and self-funded retirees through the increase in the bonus payments. Administering this will be the Family Assistance Office, which will help simplify payments in over 500 locations across the country. Even opposition members might want to avail themselves of this, because they need to be educated. They can ring 136150 and get the family assistance hotline, an office that will actually be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. - not like the old days of the DSS where the office certainly was not open on Wednesday afternoons. What we are doing is being positive for families. It is about positive policies. We actually do have policies, unlike the opposition, who do not have policies. Well, they do have some policies - they have spatial economics, they have loopy policies -  - And your policy, Wayne, of course, which is the family insecurity index, a made-up policy of 60 variables, with half of them wrong. Our policy is about assisting families, not scaring families. We are building on that great coalition tradition of building stronger families and stronger communities.</DOC>

 - I have more good news and more new news about the ever-changing, ever-expanding Work for the Dole program from the Howard government. - The government is changing the way Work for the Dole is being administered. We are moving away from the one sponsor, one project, one contract model to a broken model under which community work coordinators around the country will work with more grassroots organisations to try to ensure we have an even wider range of Work for the Dole projects. Today the government announced the first instalment of projects under this new model - more than 300 new projects, involving nearly 6,000 job seekers, at a cost of about $12 million.Ihave been asked how Work for the Dole is helping job seekers in the electorate of Moreton. I am pleased to say that the very distinguished member for Moreton has received no fewer than 500 letters from his constituents in support of this magnificent program of the Howard government, including one letter from a participant, just one of 500, detailing how she has been helped by this program. Maleena Hardy says:Work for the dole made me more confident at interviews because as soon as I mentioned I was doing work for the dole I was going to at least five interviews a week and getting better at it.We are often told by members opposite that Work for the Dole is deficient because it does not involve credentialled training. But what it does do is give job seekers the right attitude to go on and seek credentialled training. Maleena Hardy writes:I got a full-time traineeship in office skills and administration. That meant I was studying and getting experience at the same time. I don't think I would have got this chance unless I had the experience I received from doing work for the dole at PA hospital.I have been asked about alternative views. Unfortunately, the Labor controlled Brisbane City Council took extravagant advantage of Working Nation programs but has failed to heed the advice of the former employment spokesman, the member for Batman, who said that all community groups should make the most of the Work for the Dole program. Councillor Jim Soorley has failed to heed the advice of his Labor colleague the member for Batman. He should take the advice -  - Speaking on behalf of the job seekers of Moreton, Maleena Hardy has some advice for Councillor Soorley. She says:I think the Lord Mayor and the Brisbane City Council should stop playing political games and help young people in our area gain the chance they need and deserve by being part of the work for the dole project.Councillor Soorley was man enough the other day to abandon his preference deal with One Nation. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Councillor Soorley has been man enough over the last couple of days to abandon his disgraceful One Nation preference deal. He should be man enough to abandon bias and bigotry in this matter as well -   - and make use of Work for the Dole to help - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I note his concern and constructive interest in the aspirations that I know exist among some residents and citizens of Australia to have parents reunited with them. I note that members of the opposition from time to time have expressed some interest in this matter. - I notice the continuing interest of members of the Labor Party in this matter, but the problem with the Labor Party is to know exactly where they really do stand on the question. When I try to find whether they have a constructive view in relation to this issue, I find a lot of comments of the sort that I see from those who want to walk both sides of the street and those who want to be all things to all people. I notice that the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Bowman, when he was speaking on this matter back in July, accused the government -   - To have some idea of the financial constraints you need to have some idea about the sorts of numbers that the Labor Party would have in mind. The question related to the political and financial constraints in relation to the number of parents who might be allowed to permanently enter Australia. What you have is the opposition spokesman, who is prepared to hold out, as he did in the newspaper El Globo, that, maybe, the Labor Party have in mind 10,000 annual places to be available under this category. He said that when he made reference to what happened when the Labor Party was in office.If you think about 10,000 people entering Australia under a program and you know the potential health costs that are associated for a person over 65 years of age are of the order of $6,000 per year - and that includes their hospital, pharmaceutical, dental and allied health and nursing home care - and when you know that such a person may live in Australia for up to 20 years, you can see it represents a cost to the Australian community for a lifetime of something of the order of $120,000 each. For the first two years after arrival a welfare bond cost was recoverable, and data shows that very few parents access special benefits in that time. But what it does show is that two years after arrival, and for up to 10 years after arrival, when costs are not recoverable, the special benefits are accessed in lieu of the age pension. At about $8,500 for a single person, based on eight years of use, it represents a total cost per person of $68,000. When you know that after 10 years residency they could also access an age pension, based on a life expectancy of 20 years after arrival it represents another $95,000 in lifetime costs. We did put forward last year a proposal that would have enabled some of those costs to be recouped by way of a bond. Something of the order of $280,000 worth of costs would be involved. We put forward such a proposal, and what did the opposition do? - You disallowed it. - That was the best possible deal that you could have got for parents. An up-front payment of about $16,000 was involved for a couple, of which $6,000 was refundable if they did not access the benefits. The fact is that, at $280,000 per single person - so you are talking about almost a half a million dollars in lifetime costs - they effectively would have been able to get that for $16,000 up front. When the Australian taxpayer understands that that is the nature of the figures involved and the commitment that would have been made, I think they would think that I probably had in mind a very poor deal for taxpayers. I suspect, given the lifetime costs involved, that today they would expect a much more significant up-front payment to be reasonable in meeting those costs. So if you are serious about meeting those aspirations for parents, with a reasonable idea of the costs involved maybe next time you will take a more constructive approach in relation to the issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Having just visited and spent some time in his seat and having had the opportunity to talk not only to the Whip but also to people in his electorate, I am aware that, as in many rural and regional seats, average household incomes are quite low. Indeed, Mr Speaker, you would be aware of that in your own seat. As I look at the front bench, I can identify no fewer than four members of my own party whose seats see amongst the lowest average household income levels in the country - mine included, despite the fact that it includes two of the country's most productive agricultural regions. For that reason, we have a very real interest in the positive impact that tax reform can have in rural and regional areas. In fact, in the 1996 census, a large number of families in rural and regional Australia were found to be on incomes below $500 a week. On Access figures, families with children, on an income of about $500 a week, get between $30 and $40 a week extra disposable income as a result of tax cuts and social security benefit changes.  There are other aspects, though, to underline the importance of tax reform in rural and regional areas. Perhaps a little surprisingly, the proportion of people in rural areas who are in business for themselves is far higher than it is in the city. For those businesses, as has been constantly reiterated to us and is now recognised by us, capital gains tax is a major issue. It is a very significant issue indeed. The capital gains tax has been halved. As the Treasurer said yesterday, farmers with active assets can sell those assets on retirement without attracting any capital gains tax. That is a major reform and a very welcome one. It is something about which there would be absolute dismay if rural people thought it would be subject to roll-back. There is another big differentiating factor in country Australia, and that is the cost of transport. The reduction in the diesel fuel excise under the grants scheme for vehicles of 4.5 tonne gross operating in regional Australia comes to 23c a litre. That is a massive reduction in transport costs. This effective reduction in excise on diesel takes the level of taxation on fuel used for transportation in this country back to the levels of 1988. I cannot think of any other government decision - certainly not by those opposite - that has ever seen a reduction in a tax impost that takes you back to the levels of 12 years ago.We know that Labor will not get rid of the GST. We know that for all their criticisms of it they intend to keep it. It will remain should they ever find their way back into government. The Labor Party is making all sorts of claims about roll-back, and that roll-back has the potential to do a lot of damage to the benefits of tax reform in regional areas. If we get a roll-back of the GST, we will get a roll-back to the bad tax policies of old: Labor income tax cuts that do not happen; Labor's increases in wholesale sales tax, which were promised not to be necessary; capital gains tax introduced by Labor and never reformed by them. But then there is their record on fuel. When the Hawke government was elected in 1983, excise per litre was 6.155c a litre. It jumped by 1c in 1983 and another 2c by August of 1983 and then again in February 1984. Within a year there had been a 50 per cent increase in fuel taxes on ordinary motorists and the transport industry. Labor doubled it by March 1986 - in just three years - and trebled it by the end of 1986. By the end of the 1980s, excise was running at 24c a litre. When the present Leader of the Opposition took over as finance minister, Labor's excise was over 29c. But then, of course, there was the infamous 3c a litre increase in the 1993 budget. Not to be outdone, the new finance minister - the present Leader of the Opposition - added another 5c. So, at the time of the 1996 election, fuel excise - unleaded and diesel - was 34.1c a litre. That comes to a very significant figure. In 13 years of Labor - and this reflects their tax policy when it comes to fuel - a 550 per cent increase in fuel excise.</DOC>

 - This is an urgent matter because, as we speak, charge sheets, such as I have here, are being addressed in courts in the Northern Territory with results that would have been seen as excessive at the beginning of last century, let alone at the beginning of this one. For example, receiving one bottle of spring water to the value of $1 - 28 days; unlawfully entering a takeaway shop and stealing food and beverages to the value of $18.50 - 14 days; stealing petrol to the value of $2 - 28 days; unlawfully interfering with a motor vehicle and stealing $1.10 worth of petrol - 90 days; stealing four slices of bread and cordial to the value of $2.50 - sentenced to 14 days. If in the Northern Territory you were charged, like Alan Bond, with misappropriating $1 billion worth of shareholders' funds, you might go to jail, but if you steal four slices of bread and cordial you will go to jail. It is an urgent matter, Mr Speaker, because this parliament has a duty to uphold its responsibilities under international conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. When this was signed back in 1990 we did not have what is before us now. These events have occurred since. The fact that we may be embarrassed by our need to intervene in the affairs of a state or territory does not detract from our obligation to do so, as we have done twice in the last decade. There is a pattern of behaviour here which has seen this parliament - with members on both sides of the House participating - roll back positions in territories and states with which we disagreed. There was, for example, the debate in relation to the question of euthanasia, in which I participated in favour of a decision to overturn Northern Territory legislation. Both sides of the House intervened to uphold the rights of the homosexual community in Tasmania. If the rights of the homosexual community in Tasmania are worth protecting - and I do not dispute that - then the rights of Australian children are worth protecting as well.  It is a matter of urgency because of the excessive, expensive failure that this proposal has become. It takes $344 a day to keep a kid in jail. You can multiply the $344 by 14 days, 28 days, 90 days or a year and you will find that it comes out to well in excess of $18 worth of food or $1 worth of water or $2 worth of petrol. It is urgent because mandatory sentencing is a cruel and cynical hoax on the victims of crime. Victims of crime are entitled to effective detention of the perpetrators, appropriate punishment of the perpetrators and compensation for loss associated with the crime. They are entitled to all of those things and they get none of them from mandatory sentencing. Ninety per cent of burglaries in Darwin go undetected, money is spent on incarcerating kids and not on police forces, not on detection of crime. Unlawful entry offences since this act has been in place have increased by 48 per cent in Darwin. Offences against property involving criminal damage have increased in Darwin by 35 per cent over the course of the last year. It is a litany of expensive failure that falls on all Australian taxpayers, given that 75 per cent of the resources that are available for the government of the Northern Territory are available to the government of the Northern Territory at the behest of the taxpayers elsewhere in this country. We have the right to act. We have the duty and obligation to act to deal with this problem.</DOC>

 - The answer to that -  - The answer to the question is yes. -   - The answer to the question is yes. What the Leader of the Opposition has just said is that the Commonwealth parliament should enact legislation, using the external affairs power of the Constitution, based on the argued obligations of Australia under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That is the argument advanced by the opposition. I am asked by the member for Eden-Monaro whether I am aware of any arrangements that might bear upon the enactment of such legislation. I am aware of an arrangement, an understanding, that was entered into between the then Western Australian government and the then Commonwealth government about the time of the enactment of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I have in my possession - and I will table it in a moment - a letter from the then Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Joe Berinson, to the then Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, dated 28 September 1990. It was headed `UN Convention on the Rights of the Child'. The material portion for the purpose of the answer reads as follows: The Western Australian Government is prepared to agree to early ratification of the Convention by Australia subject to: ...		...		...(ii)	the State Government's understanding that there is no intention by the Commonwealth to use the external affairs power (on the basis of the Convention) to enact Commonwealth legislation to override state laws in this area.In other words, there had been an arrangement entered into between Berinson and Duffy. What they basically said was very simple and it is all of a piece with what the Leader of the Opposition does: you say one thing in opposition; you do the opposite in government. You walk both sides of the political street and you carry on as though you are a man of high principle. -   - Let the parliament clearly understand that what is involved here is a massive example of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member of the Hawke government when this letter was written by Mr Berinson. He was not only a senior member of the Hawke government but probably the most senior member of that government coming from the state of Western Australia. For all we know, he may have been involved directly in the negotiations to stitch up the deal between Joe Berinson and Michael Duffy. So let us have none of this. -  - I table the letter -  - Mr Speaker, I will table this letter. What I have read is the material part of the letter. I will read it again. It states:(ii)	the State Government's understanding that there is no intention by the Commonwealth to use the external affairs power (on the basis of the Convention) to enact Commonwealth legislation to override state laws in this area.I table the letter. - I was quoting from the document I tabled. -   - Mr Speaker, do you want me to - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Charlton for her obvious interest in this matter. I can inform the House that a bill is being drafted, and I hope that it will be presented for discussion in private members business on 10 April. Notice has been given of the bill, and it is interesting to note that I have included in the bill provisions that target only those Northern Territory laws which include children who are 17 as well as those regarded as juveniles in that state. There is the inclusion of that age because, according to international convention, those under 18 should be regarded as children.This bill constitutes an amendment to the Northern Territory Self-Government Act 1978. It involves clearly defined constitutional powers of this parliament and this government. It does not invoke any external powers to enable its application, and its philosophy is not substantially different to that behind the euthanasia legislation that this parliament passed several years ago. As I said, I expect to introduce the bill on 10 April and I hope this time frame enables members on all sides to ponder their position on this matter of high moral importance. I know there are those on the government side who would want to support this legislation, which differs very little from that which was attempted to be introduced by a member of the government side.I hope that we have a free and open debate on this matter because this is the chamber in which this matter should be debated - not that other place but here, with us as representatives. I realise that I run a certain risk out there in the community, in my electorate and elsewhere. Quite frankly, I am prepared to take that on board and to argue that this legislation is unconscionable and demands to be struck off the Northern Territory statute book. In fact, if we can get down the path to Western Australia, we should have a look at that, too. I urge the Prime Minister to reconsider his position because he has been duplicitous in this matter. There are people on that side who want to debate this issue. At least, let us bring on a debate. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and for his interest in the situation with first home owners. I think he would be aware that, as part of the move to the new tax system, a First Home Owners Scheme will be introduced which will make available $7,000 for people who have not owned a home before which they can use to buy a home. Eligible first home buyers will receive $7,000 of assistance regardless of their income level, the area in which they are planning to buy and the value of their first home. An eligible applicant must be a natural person buying or building their first home in Australia which they intend to use as their principal place of residence.The First Home Owners Scheme has been warmly welcomed. I have here some clippings that I can table for the House. The Hobart Mercury on 1 December 1999 said it would boost Tassie property markets and that it was a $7,000 first home bonus. The Advocate in Tasmania said, `Funding first home easier' on 1 December 1999. I have here a clipping from the Examiner on 1 December 1999 on the first home owner assistance program. You can imagine that I was a bit surprised by a press release issued by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday saying:Peter Costello today displayed embarrassing ignorance about an enormous anomaly in the First Home Owners Scheme, his own GST compensation program. Mr Costello is unaware of unfair and discriminatory treatment, or he knows and he doesn't care. Either way, many of Australia's homebuyers are being short. - Yes, I do read it into the Hansard because that was an attack on me from the Labor shadow Treasurer, the Hon. Simon Crean. I would like to also read into the Hansard a press release from the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania, the Hon. David Crean, released on 30 December 1999, which said `First home owners scheme launched'. Remember: the Hon. Simon Crean says that my GST compensation scheme is no good. This is what the Hon. David Crean says:The scheme is designed to provide potential first home builders or buyers with the information needed to make their first major purchase and to facilitate access -  - He always yells loudest when the talking gets best, Mr Speaker. - People at home would not know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is now yelling at the top of his voice to try to drown out the words, and the words are as follows from the Hon. David Crean:The scheme is designed to provide potential first home builders or buyers with the information needed to make their first major purchase and to facilitate access to - listen to this - the State Government's first home owners' grant, available from 1 July 2000. An increase in property turnover and building activity will have significant benefits for the Tasmanian economy ... Tasmania is said to be the biggest beneficiary. The $7,000 grant will provide an instant deposit.Here we have the Crean boys in the family business of Labor politics, with one of them up here complaining that my scheme is no good and the other in Tasmania extolling the benefits of his scheme, which happens to be the same thing. - Hypocrisy has no bounds when it comes to the Labor Party - no bounds whatsoever. - Which Crean is right? Is it Simon Crean, the man who will say or do anything and who attacks my compensation scheme, or is it David Crean, the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania, who thinks the scheme is so good he claims it as his own? I am afraid it is the Hon. David Crean, because they will do or say anything in opposition whereas in government they are forced to recognise reality. The great thing is that it took this government to do it. It took tax change to do it. It is a $7,000 First Home Owners Scheme. It is beneficial in Tasmania and it is beneficial in Deakin.  - It is going to be beneficial in Chisholm, it is going to be beneficial in Dunkley, it is going to be beneficial in Forde, it is going to be beneficial for all of the first home owners in Australia - and, again, it took a coalition government to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. She is absolutely right: the small business community has been a great generator of jobs under this government because as a government we go out of our way to encourage small business and as they grow and get bigger more jobs are created, and that is good for the community as a whole. There are alternative policies being promoted by some, particularly in the area of taxation. You can imagine that I was aghast to find that the member for Paterson is encouraging small business people in his electorate to go to a breakfast - in fact, it is a breakfast seminar - being run by the former ACTU president, now shadow Treasurer of the Labor Party, Mr Crean, on 24 March. I am surprised because in the electorate of the honourable member for Paterson he has got beef and dairy farming, chicken growers and the like, and what is interesting is that we know from independent research that those businesses and many others are the beneficiaries of the government's new tax package. In fact, for small grazing properties it is just under $2,000 a year, for medium grazing $5,500 and for cropping partnerships $18,000 a year in reduced costs, making their businesses more viable and giving them the chance to employ more people. At this seminar apparently they are going to launch some small business information for the small business community. You can imagine what that will be like, Mr Speaker. You don't need to imagine, because here I have from the member for Paterson information about the GST, which he is circulating at this very moment. It starts with an interesting cover sheet, which says: As you know, Labor is totally opposed to the GST.Then he says:You deserve to be informed.You deserve to be informed, all right. They are so opposed to the GST they are going to keep it. As they supply the information, the information they are not going to be handing out at this seminar is the extent of the changes that small businesses will have to undergo if the Labor Party are ever elected. It is absolutely ludicrous. The Labor Party are opposed to what they claim to be the complexity of the GST, but if ever they are elected the first thing they are going to do, after the GST has just been settled down and everybody has just got used it, is to change the GST. Just to add insult to injury, their policy is not only to make it more complex but also to put up income tax to pay for it. This is a breakfast at 20 bucks a head. I tell you what: that is not the price you will pay if you are in small business if Labor are ever elected. The real price will be the higher income tax and the higher capital gains tax. This is just a campaign of duplicity run by the Labor Party to deceive the very people in our economy who are creating jobs.</DOC>

 - Apart from making the observation that it would appear that those on the other side of the House do not favour Rockhampton having an airport capable of taking 747s and 767s, I say in regard to the airport capacity that the runway, both in terms of its length and now the strengthening program that will be completed in a couple of months, will be capable of taking international flights. In terms of the particular issue that the member raised at the outset of his question, if there has been some technicality -  -  - If there was some ruling, and I am certainly not going to take your word for it, I will investigate and have a look at it. I might add it would obviously have applied to the airport at a time when it was not capable of taking those big international flights anyway. I reiterate to this House that we have put $7 million into upgrading an airport that the people of Rockhampton want and support but you apparently do not, which will give it the capacity to take international flights, and we have a reformed aviation policy that allows unrestricted access to airports that are capable of taking those sorts of flights. That is a significant advance on your aviation policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. Of course this government is very concerned about people working illegally in Australia and has taken steps to address this issue at several levels. Members would know that I established a review of illegal workers in Australia. It was oversighted by a reference group chaired by the former member for Riverina-Darling, Mr Noel Hicks. It also included one of your former colleagues, Gary Johns, the former minister. The review has proposed a number of measures which include an enhanced employer awareness program to make employers' understanding of their responsibilities in checking work rights clear; upgrading of the information available to employers to enable them to check work rights; and provision of warnings and ultimately fines of up to $66,000 and two years jail for employers who consistently engage staff who have no work rights. I would like to compare this with the 13 years of Labor, when there were no sanctions against employers who persistently breached. - I am interested that the member for Bowman asks how many have been prosecuted? He says you should be prosecuting people when there are no sanctions in place. That is what he is asserting. Yesterday, he had the audacity to put out a press release. And what did he say in it? He said:'To the best of my knowledge, since this Government has been in office not one person or corporation - not one - has been prosecuted by the Department of Immigration of knowingly employing illegal labour ...'There is no such offence in our law or known to our law. Thirteen years in office; no action in relation to these matters; and now the suggestion that people should be prosecuted for an offence that does not exist and is unknown. - The honourable member for Cunningham says, `Four years and what have you done?' Let us understand what has happened in that time.  - Around 3,000 people have had visas cancelled on the grounds of a non-bona fide visit, and many of them could have been working. If the opposition would care to read the report - and the report is available - they would find that 940 people had their visas cancelled specifically for breach of work rights. In addition - and these figures make very interesting reading - over the last year of Labor, 1995-96, there were 7,800 locations of overstayers. In 1998-99, under the coalition 13,472 overstayers were located. In terms of performance, you have seen an increase of 72 per cent and a large number of those people have been removed from Australia. So we have gone from a situation in which there were effectively no runs on the board to a situation where there are substantial runs on the board.To those members who I know are genuinely interested in it, I want to say that I am willing to work with and cooperate with them in relation to these measures. I have had the CFMEU come and talk to me and I would encourage them to continue talking to me. I would encourage them to do that rather than go to the press with stories about illegal workers in a situation in which not all the information is on the table. They gave us a list the other day of about 100 names of people they thought were unlawfully in Australia and working. We checked that list very carefully, and something like 40 per cent of them were permanent residents. They would have us going out there conducting raids in relation to these matters and, essentially, rousing up Australian permanent residents. They go off into the air and say there ought to be raids, and the very next day when we went to one of the sites in which it was alleged there were large numbers of people working unlawfully only three unlawfuls could be found.  It is important that we work together and cooperate in relation to these measures. But you ought to give credit where credit is due and you ought to recognise that your own performance when you were in government was absolutely abysmal.</DOC>

 - It has to be said that the member for Parramatta has focused on an issue that is of real concern to us in rural and regional Australia. I want to say one thing at the outset, which is that I find what is happening in much of rural and regional Australia quite gut wrenching because the adjustment processes are harsh and difficult. When it comes to country people taking a realistic view of the options before them and acting on them, I would suggest to everyone in the House that rural people have displayed very real courage and very real adaptability. We have lost 10½ per cent of our farmers in this country since 1985. They are facing great adjustment pressures. In my view, they are coping with enormous courage and resilience.I also make the observation that more broadly it is quite apparent that rural people are prepared to cope with realities, to move when that is required. I find that gut wrenching as well. I come from a seat that in geographical terms is currently the size of England, roughly, without Scotland and Wales. As a result of depopulation, something which I say quite unashamedly in this place I find utterly gut wrenching, my electorate is about to become the size of England with Scotland and Wales. That reflects very real pressures. But the underlying story that has to be told is one of resilience and courage -  -  - Isn't it revealing that all we can get is cheap interjections from the person who used to speak for agriculture in this place -  - I conclude by making three brief points. The first is that I do accept that the member for Parramatta is concerned to see that people have job opportunities wherever they are, in fairness to him. I make the second point that it is very reflective of the ALP's commitment to policy that on this particular issue all they have tried to do is play politics at a personal level - personality politics. The third and final point that I make is that if there is one thing that is absolutely established beyond all doubt as I move around rural and regional Australia it is that they see you as completely irrelevant to the policy process. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am sure all members of the House would be aware that the figures released yesterday indicated that Australia enjoyed significant increases in exports of minerals and energy in the December quarter last year. They increased by 8.4 per cent to $10.2 billion compared with the September quarter. Of course, the member for Kalgoorlie, being a very good representative for Western Australia, would be aware that more than one-third of Australia's mining exports come from the great state of Western Australia. So these are very important figures that we are seeing released. The mining and resources export sector is growing very well. Our government wholeheartedly supports that and will strengthen their competitiveness with the implementation of the new taxation system, as they will be beneficiaries of part of the $3.5 billion worth of cost reductions on exporters as well as the abolition of diesel excise for the rail industry - the minerals and resources sector being large rail users.  One other part of that sector that is going very well at the moment is the exports of alumina and aluminium. Alumina exports climbed 11 per cent and aluminium exports rose 10 per cent. Australia accounts for nearly 30 per cent of world alumina production, and over three-quarters of that production is exported. Whilst in Dubai recently on a trade mission with 60 business people from Australia, we had the opportunity of visiting Dubal, the Dubai aluminium company, which has just signed a contract over eight years to purchase $1.4 billion worth of alumina from the Alcoa refinery in Kwinana in Western Australia. Interestingly, that happens to be in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition, in Western Australia. Whilst there, the management of that aluminium factory raised a concern with me, and that was continuity and consistency of supply. Last December there was an irresponsible strike by the rail unions in Western Australia that threatened to disrupt the supply of alumina to their factory and those very valuable exports to Australia. It is interesting to note that we have not seen a comment at all from the Leader of the Opposition with regard to these irresponsible strikes. Incidentally, I inform the House that those rail loco drivers, I am advised, were on strike again last night in Kwinana and Bunbury, threatening the very jobs of those people who work in that export industry in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition. The Labor Party in Australia have always been closely associated with the union movement. They claimed whilst in government that that was a very cosy arrangement and that it should still be taking place. The shadow spokesman for trade, who I understand is travelling to Europe shortly to announce the Labor Party's trade policy, said recently in a press release that `Key governments in Britain, France, Italy and Germany are strongly influenced by their countries' union movements.' This government is not, but we know the Labor Party is. The challenge before the Leader of the Opposition at the moment is to deal with his union mates in Western Australia and not put the jobs of those workers in the Alcoa factory in Kwinana at risk. I got that first-hand from the Dubal factory in Dubai, to which we are selling $1.4 billion worth of alumina out of the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition. Those drivers were on strike again last night, threatening the existence of the jobs in that factory. The challenge that those workers in that factory want to put before the Leader of the Opposition is to have him intervene in this and get the railway workers back to work to guarantee those exports.</DOC>

 - The first point is that I am not going to accept the validity of the letter. I will have a look in my files and see if it is there. I would not believe a word that the member for Paterson had to say, for the very first point. At that time, that may well have been the case because we were experiencing low petrol prices in our part of the world. Our government, the coalition government, has been working vigorously to address the issues within the petroleum industry in Australia and at streamlining that process. Let us just get a few facts on the record. The very first fact that we need to get on the record is that the party that the member for Paterson is a member of, the Australian Labor Party, is the party in government in this country that took fuel excise from 6c a litre to well over 35c or 36c a litre. That is one of the major points that need to be made. The Australian Labor Party, from the time they came into office until the time they went out of office, continually ratcheted up those fuel excises - ratcheted them up until they were up in the mid-30s. That is the first point to make.The second point to make is that when our government was trying to address the issues of petroleum pricing in Australia - fundamentally, the structural issues with regard to the petroleum industry - we were opposed at every point along that line. At every point the Labor Party in this House and in the Senate opposed the reforms that we were trying to make so far as Australia's petroleum industry was concerned.The third point to make is that we do not have control over international oil prices. Just to inform the House, on the recent visit to the Middle East that I referred to in my last answer, I took the opportunity whilst there of not only talking to my counterparts, the trade ministers, in those countries but also talking to those ministers responsible for the production of oil in those countries. I asked them how long they thought that the current international price of oil was going to stay as high as it is. They indicated to me that there is an OPEC meeting coming up on 27 March when this issue will be addressed. They will address the issue of oil production and oil prices. At the same time I asked for their indication of where they thought international oil prices should ultimately lie. The indication generally was between $21 and $24 a barrel. That is a market circumstance on a spot market across the world. But the member for Paterson's question indicates that we have responsibility for international oil prices. We don't. I will go back to the first point I made in answering this question. It was the Labor Party when in government that took fuel excise from around 6c a litre to over 34c a litre in this country. So the member for Paterson should look at his own backyard and at some of the current structure of oil pricing in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. Education is, of course, a big winner under the government's new tax system. All education activities related to the schools curriculum are GST free. After 1 July Labor's wholesale sales tax, the tax system that they favour as an alternative to the GST, will be completely abolished. As a result of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, according to tax office estimates the cost of delivering education in Australia over four years will fall by close to $1 billion. That is the level of Labor's current impost on the cost of delivering education in Australia. The average family on $40,000 a year with two children will be over $47 a week better off after the effects of the GST, so education will become more affordable for Australian families. Australian families will be able to afford a better education for their children. Income support payments such as the youth allowance, Abstudy, Austudy and the Australian postgraduate awards will be increased by four per cent from 1 July, which means that students will have more money in their pockets. Students who work part time will benefit from income tax cuts and a $600 increase in the tax-free threshold, taking that up to $6,000. What a contrast this is with the education policies of the Labor Party and the lack of those policies in opposition. It is quite clear that Kim Beazley's roll-back is going to rip these benefits away from Australian students and Australian families, because he has no alternative under this roll-back policy - this infamous policy that he has put forward - but to increase income taxes. Increased income taxes are going to take money away from Australian families. They are going to take money away from Australian students. Labor does not believe in making education more affordable; it believes in making education less affordable. That is why the wholesale sales tax is already putting an almost $1 billion impost on education over four years. In conjunction with his mates in the Australian education union, arm in arm with Shazza, he wants to roll back not only the government's tax reforms and the benefits they bring to families but also the literacy benchmarks, the New Apprenticeships system and greater choice for parents. The Leader of the Opposition has never been interested in education, and his roll-back policy confirms once again that the opposition does not have the interests of education and of Australian parents and families at heart. </DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer questions about tax and the rules which apply -  - I am very happy to answer questions on tax which are within the area of responsibility of Treasury. I make the point that in relation to retirement villages - that is, in relation to those people who own their homes and where they are purchasing services - those services are subject to GST. In relation to those people who rent their villas or units or whatever they may be, the maintenance fees which are charged are input taxed and are worked into the rent in exactly the same way as they would be in relation to residential rents. This question, of course, arises from an article in today's Herald Sun by Clinton Porteous. I would echo the words of Deputy Commissioner Rick Matthews who said:Residents of retirement villages were being treated the same as everyone else. Rents were input taxed but people who owned their own home had to pay GST to maintain their property. The treatment is equal.Those rules which apply generally apply in relation to retirement villages because they apply on the same basis of ownership or residential rents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also thank him for his interest in this area. He can take great personal credit for and pride in the John Flynn scholarship scheme. Health is an area that requires balance across a broad area. Balance is often used between public and private and between city and rural. Nowhere could the difference between the opposition and the government be more stark than in this area where the opposition certainly have no understanding of what balance means between public and private sectors in health care. It is interesting to note that, since November 1998, we have had 29 separate press releases from the opposition about the 30 per cent rebate - every one of them carping, negative and opportunistic. In a press release on 13 March last year, the member for Jagajaga stated: Instead of propping up private health insurance the government should recognise that the public are very happy with Medicare. On 28 September last year, the member for Jagajaga said in the House:The Australian public are well aware of what they get from Medicare and they do not have the government's ideological commitment to private health insurance.So opposed are they to the 30 per cent rebate, they have decided to keep it in spite of the shadow minister going round and privately briefing journalists that the opposition was thinking of abolishing it. All the opposition has to do to understand how popular the 30 per cent rebate and Lifetime Health Cover are is to stand outside any Medicare Private, HBA or MBF office, or any other private health insurance company, at the moment and see how many people are joining up under Lifetime Health Cover. She could actually call Medibank Private's free call number 1800 188188 and talk to any of the 95 operators who have had to be put on to deal with the interest in Lifetime Health Cover. This number is going up to nearly 260 operators next month, just to deal with the extra interest and extra demand. We all know that the opposition does not support the balance of private and public. They sat by for more than a decade and watched private health insurance decline by two per cent a year. They sat idly by in 1991-92 and watched premiums go up by 17 per cent a year. The government's policy has always been that we should have a balanced, robust public health system complemented by a viable private system.The other area where this is obvious is in the balance between city and country. The single most significant thing we have done to get more doctors into country areas is to use what is called the provider number legislation - legislation the opposition fought tooth and nail against in 1996. In 1996 we had scaremongering that there would be 400 young doctors a year turned on to the scrap heap because of this legislation. Four years of graduation on, we should have 1,600 doctors, by the opposition's counting. When Ron Phillips did his review late last year, he could not find a single doctor anywhere in Australia who was without work because of the provider number legislation. This legislation is back in the House and the opposition is going to have to decide what it wants to do, because if the sunset clause is not repealed, it will mean that many doctors from country areas will flood into city areas and doctors who have come from overseas to work in a country area will not actually be bound to do what they undertook to do. It would be a disaster for rural Australia. But the opposition is going around privately, again - it does a lot of private briefings - saying, `We're going to be on the side of the young docs.' What that means is that you are going to sell out rural Australia. You have no direction and no ideas. You get into short-term interest groups, you cannot deliver anything and you will tag along with whatever is the easiest thing to do. Quite frankly, you are not strong enough to be unpopular.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I advised the House last week that there is a real risk that the Commonwealth's exposure to the member for Fremantle's legal costs could exceed $750,000. Members are aware that this liability is due to the actions of advisers in the offices of then Prime Minister Keating and the member for Fremantle when she was the minister for health. I wrote to Gary Gray, one of the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, making the reasonable request that the trustees of the fund take steps to pay the proceeds of the fund to the Commonwealth and thereby reduce the exposure of taxpayers to the costs of the member for Fremantle. Mr Gray has responded. He said that the trustees of the fund `do not have the power to pay these funds to the Commonwealth'. This is quite extraordinary when we see media reports that the fund is writing to contributors seeking their agreement to the balance of the fund being used for other purposes, presumably ALP purposes.Today I have again written to Mr Gray and have asked the trustees to take the only honourable and decent option open to them: to write to contributors and ask that they agree to the fund being used for what it was intended - payment of the legal costs of the member for Fremantle. If this does not occur, it will be another example of Labor protecting its own interests and thumbing its nose at ordinary taxpayers. What about the Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition ought to do the honourable and decent thing and tell the trustees to do the honourable and decent thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Over the last three weeks, the number of applications for Australian business numbers has increased dramatically. In the last three weeks, 391,515 applications were received. As of today, there are over one million applications and 858,000 Australian business numbers have been issued, including 106,285 Australian business numbers which were processed over the weekend. There has also been a dramatic rise in electronic lodgments, with electronic lodgments running at about 47 per cent of total applications. This proportion is rising. Of the total applications, over 75 per cent have been processed within four weeks and, for electronic applications, over 70 per cent have been processed and have had an ABN issued within two weeks. Of the one million applications, there are now only 1.7 per cent that are more than 28 days old. So there is a dramatic increase in the applications and in the issue of Australian business numbers.I would recommend to those businesses that can do it through electronic lodgment, with their tax accounts and like, that they do so. They can be turned around extremely quickly - indeed, even turned around out of hours, as we saw with 106,000 being turned around over the weekend. I also remind businesses that intend to register that they are guaranteed an Australian business number if they apply by 31 May. It is very important to apply by 31 May. If they leave it until after 31 May, they are not guaranteed their Australian business number by 1 July, which they will want to have in order to claim back their input tax credits. This dramatic increase which is now taking place shows that business is now improving dramatically in applying for its Australian business numbers and getting to grips with the system. We would encourage those remaining businesses that have not yet applied to do so, preferably this month, and to remember that it cannot be done later than 31 May with a guaranteed number by 1 July.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the statements that have been made by the Premier of Western Australia and by a number of my colleagues, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I believe some of the reactions that have followed the publication of the submission made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the Senate committee have been unreasonable. For the benefit of the House, I think it would be desirable if all members of the House actually read the submission. They would gain from the reading of that submission a number of fundamental facts. The first is that the government does not for a moment deny that there were practices carried out in relation to the indigenous population of this country which are in today's standards quite unacceptable. There has never been any attempt by the government to deny that. There has never been any attempt by the government to deny the proposition that the removal of children and the separation of children from their families inflicted a large amount of trauma and suffering on those people at the time and that the consequences of that suffering and trauma endure in their descendants to this day and certainly in relation to those who were removed who are alive today.That is not at issue, and the government does not argue that. The submission was not designed, in the words of one daily newspaper on Saturday, to categorise the debate about the stolen generation as being a `myth'. It was not designed to do that. It was designed in an honest way, and I reject the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition. It was designed in an honest way to put some facts on the record. If we are to have intelligent debate about these issues, we ought to be willing to place facts on the record, and we ought also to acknowledge that it is not an issue in which exaggerated claims should be made on either side of the debate. That puts an obligation on the government, it puts an obligation on the opposition and it also puts an obligation on those who write and otherwise comment on political affairs in this country.Mr Speaker, it is undeniable that people were removed forcibly and in circumstances which Australians today would regard as quite unacceptable. It is also undeniable that some of those removed years ago - and, I repeat, some of them - would be removed under the operation of existing laws today, and that applies in relation to both the indigenous and non-indigenous section of the Australian population. Might I also say that the figure of 10 per cent that was used in the submission, and has formed the basis of a lot of the comment that has followed the publication of this submission, I am advised was originally drawn from a survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and released in 1994. As I understand it, and as I am advised, it is not a figure that was generated for a particular political purpose by the minister or by the government. I repeat for the benefit of the House that it was a figure taken from a document released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1994.These are difficult issues. They are not resolved by sloganeering on either side. They are not resolved by using exaggerated claims on either side of the debate. At no stage has this government denied that certain practices were carried out which we would all find quite unacceptable and quite distasteful, and in relation to which I think there is a significant level of sorrow and regret within the Australian community. It is equally the case, if we are to have an intelligent understanding of what occurred, that all of the relevant facts should be available to the Australian community. It was not the government's initiation that this submission be put forward; it was in response to a request from a Senate inquiry. The minister put the submission forward in good faith and I think he has argued the context of that submission with his commendable decency and candour.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and his enduring interest and concern for the people of East Timor. Let me begin by saying that we welcome the Indonesian government's very recent decision at the end of last week to extend by three months the time for the East Timorese who are in camps in west Timor to make up their minds as to whether they wish to return to East Timor or whether they wish to remain in Indonesia. I also welcome the fact that the Indonesians are extending humanitarian assistance for a further three months to people in the camps in west Timor. We have made it perfectly clear that we think the refugees should be allowed to make a decision on their own future free from intimidation and fear. I remind the House that we are continuing to cooperate with the international community in providing assistance to refugees. So far we have provided around $12 million to assist the people in the camps and to facilitate their return to East Timor. This demonstrates yet again the practical support that this government is giving to the East Timorese people, which has been a constant of this government's time in office. The honourable member for Aston asked whether there are alternative approaches. I noticed that during the weekend the former leader of the Labor Party - although from his appearances on television recently I have begun to wonder whether he isn't still the Leader of the Labor Party - Mr Paul Keating, much admired by you -  -  - We will get back to that. I notice that Mr Keating was on television once more claiming to be an expert on issues Indonesian and on matters pertaining to Asia. I want to make two points about that. First of all, Mr Keating is not an expert on Asia or Indonesia. He is not an expert on Indonesia, and if you think he is, it shows how you have been sucked in by your leader, or should I say your former leader. - I think I am right in saying that Mr Keating never visited Indonesia in all the time he was a member of parliament up until he became the Prime Minister. So, for 21 or 22 years it was a place you flew over and looked down on from 35,000 feet on the way to Europe. - On your way to Paris, and then suddenly he became the Prime Minister and it was the epicentre of our universe. Mr Speaker, I will tell you what was not at the epicentre of his universe, or the Labor Party's universe, and that was East Timor. - Paul Keating made it perfectly clear at the weekend that if Paul Keating had remained as the Prime Minister of this country after the 1996 election -  - the people of East Timor would not be free today. That is the difference between this man and his predecessor. What is extraordinary, Mr Speaker -  -  - I know it hurts the Labor Party to hear about human rights because you never did anything about it. - As I was saying, Mr Speaker, there are alternative approaches. There is the alternative approach of the former leader of the Labor Party Mr Keating. What was interesting - and this is the last point I will make about the alternative approach of Mr Keating, you will be pleased to hear - was that, despite all the comments that Mr Keating made about how Australia should not have stood up for the people of East Timor, who was silent? Who had nothing to say? Who refused to repudiate him? The current Leader of the Opposition. I was at an agricultural show on Saturday and somebody came up to me and said, `Mr Downer, is Mr Keating still the leader of the Labor Party?' I said, `You can believe he is, because the present leader of the Labor Party is too weak to repudiate him.'</DOC>

 - The views on this matter of mine and the views of the government have been encapsulated on numerous occasions. It is clear that large numbers of children were taken away from their parents in circumstances that could only be described as forcible removal. It is also clear that the numbers that were taken away cannot be established after this lapse of time with total precision. It is also clear that many of them -  - Many were taken in circumstances where under today's laws they would be regarded as being properly and lawfully taken from their families in the interests of their own protection. I would clearly have in mind the operation of child protection laws in many parts of the country. As to the use of a particular term to collectively describe the practice, different people have different terms. I content myself with the submission that was made on behalf of the government. I content myself with the response that was made. People have talked a lot about being semantic with statistics. I could equally say that the Leader of the Opposition is being semantic with words. The reality is that large numbers of children were taken in circumstances where they should not have been taken. Those practices, as I have often acknowledged in the past, represent the most blemished chapter in the history of this country. I have never walked away from that. The government has never walked away from that. But, equally, those people who are genuinely concerned about the process of reconciliation in our nation will not decry attempts to have a sensible, reasoned and as far as possible free of rhetorical flourish debate about this issue. We do not achieve anything on this issue by arguing the toss about a particular expression on either side. We do achieve a great deal by acknowledging facts and showing to the Australian community a willingness to debate facts. That is what the minister was doing. Those who deny him the right or impugn his motives for doing that I think are downgrading the debate and they are certainly not serving the interests of the indigenous people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I know of his real interest in this matter. Having been through his electorate a couple of times recently, I can report that there is a great deal of real interest and benefit happening in terms of development in that very interesting part of Victoria. I committed myself to calling together the state ministers responsible for regional development and services and also representatives of local government at last year's summit to talk about a real concern that came up repeatedly through the working groups and so forth about a lack of coordination and cooperation within and between the three tiers of government on the delivery of the things that we try to do to benefit rural and regional Australia. I can report that it was in fact a very successful meeting, which I think is good news for regional Australia. All of those who attended were deeply seized of the need to get it right - all states and all territories and local government as well.I note that we issued a communique afterwards. It said, `All ministers register their deep concern that in the face of growing challenge and change, regional and rural Australia needs the sustained support of all levels of government in helping create opportunity and prosperity.' There was a real belief there that opportunity and prosperity can be identified and secured but that we need to work together to overcome the challenges that undoubtedly for some areas - not all, but some - remain in the way. So ministers agreed to work together to establish a clear framework for cooperation between all levels of government in the area of regional development. We also established a fixed-term task force - it will last for just three months - to work through opportunities for improved collaboration and cooperation, including in the areas of shopfront service delivery, regional leadership development, one-stop shops and so forth. That task force's work will be considered at a meeting of relevant ministers and local government authorities around the middle of the year. I do have to report my disappointment that, in contrast to all other state and territory governments, the ALP government in Victoria, despite their much touted concern for and commitment to regional Australia, could not see fit to send their responsible minister or an alternative minister. I also have to record my other disappointment - that is, that the shadow minister in this place, far from making a constructive contribution to the debate, claimed that local government was left out of it. I just seek to place on record that the President of the Australian Local Government Association, John Ross, wrote to me on 30 March saying, `I can assure you that local government has a genuine and long-term commitment to regional development and we appreciate being recognised as a partner in a whole of government approach that is dedicated to finding long-term solutions to a better future for the people we jointly represent.' </DOC>

 - The question is hypothetical, but I will nonetheless endeavour to answer it. With the greatest of respect to the Leader of the Opposition, I do not believe that this line of questioning, while he may think it is politically advantageous to the Labor Party, is promoting the cause of a more rational debate or discussion on this issue. The minister has put forward on behalf of the government a submission. This submission is in response to a request from the Senate committee. It is an attempt - and it can be criticised, as it has been by some, unreasonably in my view and overemotionally in my view - to put on the table an honest assessment of some of the facts. It is interesting in all of the debate that has gone on since the publication of this report - and I think Saturday's Daily Telegraph was the most prominent report and one that I think quite mischievously and erroneously used the word `myth'; there is no word `myth' in this report, that was the invention of the headline writer of the newspaper - that there has been no serious attempt made by the Leader of the Opposition, or indeed by anybody else, to dispute on a factual basis what is contained in this report.Let me say on behalf of the government that if there are factual errors in this report or if there are propositions that are advanced on grounds that are insubstantial, unreasonable or unfair, then the government will examine them. This is meant to be nothing more than what was asked of the government: to respond to an inquiry by the Senate committee. It does not represent an exhaustive statement of policy on indigenous affairs by the government. I think the submission is a contribution to the analysis, but it does not deserve to be put at any higher level than that, not that the government in any way retreats from what is contained in the submission. So those who are interested should read the report. If they can find something in it that is wrong, let them point that out to the minister. I repeat: this document does not deny in any way that practices were engaged in that are totally unacceptable according to the standards of today. They were the practices that this parliament unanimously had in contemplation when it passed its motion last year acknowledging that the treatment of the indigenous people of this country represents the most blemished chapter in the nation's history and when we recorded our regret and sorrow at the injustices that were meted out to indigenous people within the Australian community. There is nothing in this document that in any way walks away from that statement of attitude both by the government and by the opposition. All of us in this parliament understand the sensitivity of these issues. There is goodwill, I believe, in the minds and hearts of people on both sides of the parliament on this issue. And what this document is designed to do is to contribute in an unemotional way to this debate; it is not designed to create the sorts of outcomes that have been attributed to it by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was out in front of the parliament saying that this document had been put forward by the government as a diversion from debate on Telstra and the goods and services tax. The Leader of the Opposition was beside himself saying that it was a diversion; it was nothing of the kind. This document was a response. Who has asked all the questions about it? The Leader of the Opposition. He is running around saying it is a diversion but I have had the first four questions on the issue. The Leader of the Opposition can question me as often as he likes, but perhaps in the remaining six questions he has he could point out to me some of the factual errors in the document so that we can then set about remedying them if the basis of the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition is correct. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What we are seeing in Victoria is exactly what we would see if ever we had a federal Labor government. It is quite obvious what is happening in Victoria. As David Buckingham of the Business Council said, confidence in Victoria in the business community is `taking a battering'. We have already had projects deferred or cancelled in Victoria because of the control that the unions have over the state Labor government. As recently as last Friday, the Australian Financial Review reported yet another project - this one a $50 million project - dumped. Dumped why? Because, as is always the case with weak Labor leaders, they do what the unions tell them and the cost of that is a loss of investment and a loss of jobs. Not only are the unions in Victoria running riot with the state Labor government compliant, putty in their hands, but they are in Victoria doing to the state Labor government what they do to the federal Labor opposition - and that is they tell you what your policies will be. So on the weekend we saw announced the latest set of policies from the Victorian Trades Hall Council. What do they want? They want a new industrial relations system so they can put their mates into jobs in the establishment of a $24 million commission to be paid for by taxpayers. They want to widen unfair dismissal laws, which will mean fewer jobs, not more jobs. They say that there is no place for the making of an individual agreement. So if you as the employee want to have an agreement with your employer, because the union bosses are not involved you are not allowed to. They also have a requirement that there will be collective bargaining only on the basis that their unions are a party to the bargain.In the private sector in Australia 80 per cent of people are not in unions, but if you in your workplace want to sit down with your mates and do a deal with your boss which is good for the business and good for the employees these union bosses, telling the Labor Party what to do, say that you are not even allowed to have an agreement unless the union secretary, who has no members in that workplace, first agrees. - Half the frontbench are former trade union leaders; this is where you get your policy from. Lastly, instead of having enterprise bargaining, which was the Labor Party's policy when it was in government, now the unions are saying, `We have to have industry-wide bargaining.' So you could be working in a business and everybody is happy in that business, but because the unions tell you to go on strike, even though it is against your interest, you will be required under these laws to take industrial action. That is a recipe for the high levels of industrial action that we had when Labor was last in office. It should be noted that, when Labor was in office, the average level of days lost per 1,000 employees was 190; under us it is about 80. Under Labor, that would mean a massive increase in the level of strikes and the consequent loss of jobs. Arch Bevis, the shadow minister, said it all when, in the Financial Review of 20 March, he said: ... there's no question of the commitment of Labor here in Canberra. There is no doubt at all that our industrial relations policy will be predicated on restoring the traditional rights of unions and their members. In other words, they are more interested in looking after their union mates and their union bosses, and the people who suffer are the rank and file who lose job opportunities as a result.</DOC>

 - I was asked a somewhat similar question about two years ago. If you think back to the time that the opinions that you are referring to relate to, they were several months prior to the legislation being finalised in the Senate. As I explained about two years ago, we got advice on a continuous basis. We were quite satisfied at the time the Senate settled the legislation that our obligations were complied with and we were not in breach of any international obligations. The legislation was a fair compromise of contentious political interests. We are not in the business of providing legal advice at the drop of a hat or at the request of individuals even in this parliament. It is the ongoing practice of successive governments not to provide legal advice or even at times to mention that they have sought it.The member for Banks suggests that the amendments to the Native Title Act are, in the view of some, in breach of international obligations. If you are referring to the CERD committee, which has recently reported, you would be well aware that in March and August last year we rejected the report of the CERD committee. It reiterated last week those same opinions, and again we reject the conclusion. There are no reasons offered. It is just simply adopting a political point of view in a report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. I know how committed he is to making sure that young people in his electorate get high quality training opportunities. He will undoubtedly be aware that the policies of this government have significantly increased education and training opportunities in regional and rural Australia. Indeed, in December last year, there were 87,320 new apprentices in training in regional Australia - that is twice as many as in the last year of the Labor government. In other words, this government has doubled quality training for apprentices and apprenticeship type opportunities in regional Australia. This year, we expect an additional 50,000 young people to commence a new apprenticeship.This is a proud record, and it contrasts dramatically with the record of the Leader of the Opposition, who was the last responsible Labor minister, when some 20,000 traditional trade apprenticeships disappeared in one year. Contrary to the policies of the Labor Party, this government has made available a wide range of training opportunities. These new apprenticeships are available across a range of Australian industries, and they give young people the chance to get a nationally recognised qualification. We have been able to achieve this because, unlike the Labor Party, we have not elevated the Labor Party's union mates to a controlling role in the apprenticeship system. When the Labor Party was in office, the unions were given authority to walk into workplaces whenever an employer wanted to take on a trainee or an apprentice. - The Leader of the Opposition makes fun of this. He asks if they were wearing red suits and did they have a horn and a tail. Believe me, many employers who had union-free workplaces were very concerned about the nature of those who might come through the door and try to represent a political agenda instead of a job creating training agenda.I was asked whether I was aware of any alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition of course has no credibility in this area. There has been no advance in his thinking on training since he was the responsible minister. Indeed, what the Australian of 24 June 1992 wrote about his alternative policies remains true today. It said:What is crystal clear, however, is that Mr Beazley ... is having trouble pulling it off this time around. He has been unable to control the training agenda, failing to impose his own mark and thus stave off interference. ... His failure to run hard on TAFE and training and kids and jobs has allowed the erosion of his position. The Leader of the Opposition had no policies then. There are no alternative training policies now, and it is this government which is providing quality training opportunities to young Australians in regional and rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I want to start with the end part of the question because it goes to motive. Despite the language in which it was clad, the purpose of the Leader of the Opposition's question was to maintain differences of opinion over indigenous affairs as a divisive political issue in the Australian community. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this parliament this question time as the man outraged about the behaviour of the government, yet in reality he is the person who seeks to use this issue to divide the Australian community. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that on 26 August last year the members of the Labor Party joined the government in unanimously supporting a resolution dealing with the issue of reconciliation, which amongst other things said that the House:... acknowledges that the mistreatment of many indigenous Australians over a significant period represents the most blemished chapter in our history.Those are the words that were put forward by the government. Those words were supported by those who sit opposite, and those words are designed, amongst other things, to have contemplation of the events relating to the forced removal in earlier years of indigenous children. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that particular paragraph encapsulates the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of the Australian community. We might differ and argue about other approaches to reconciliation, but recognising that the treatment of indigenous people does represent the most blemished chapter in our national history is something that I think most Australians agree upon.The Leader of the Opposition implies in his question that the government has abandoned the quest for reconciliation. Let me tell him that the government has not abandoned the quest for reconciliation. The government believes very strongly that the goals of reconciliation are very important national goals that this government will continue to pursue. It is not easy to achieve reconciliation. I am not expressing my own words on this. I think I am expressing the words of many reasonable indigenous leaders who have said that the process of reconciliation will in fact take years. That is the view of the Chairman of the Reconciliation Council, it is the view of the Chairman of ATSIC, it is the view of many commentators on indigenous affairs and it is certainly the view of the government.Last week I had the opportunity to launch an indigenous program dealing with literacy and numeracy, commiting $27 million for a program to address one of the proven and admitted causes of indigenous disadvantage in the Australian community: the fact that indigenous Australians' levels of literacy and numeracy are even worse than those of other Australians. This is something I describe as practical reconciliation. That was criticised by some - not many - within the indigenous leadership, but the great bulk of them saw it for what it was: a practical gesture on the part of the government towards the goal of reconciliation. We remain committed to those sorts of things, and the Leader of the Opposition knows that we are committed to those things. The Leader of the Opposition knows that we are putting unprecedented levels of resources into attacking the health problems of indigenous Australians. The Leader of the Opposition knows that there are not racial motives in the policies of this government. The Leader of the Opposition knows that the government is not endeavouring to divide the Australian community on this issue. The Leader of the Opposition knows that it is not the intention of the government on these issues to create division within the Australian community. We have an honest difference of opinion on the issue of a formal apology. It remains the view of this government that a formal national apology is not appropriate. It remains the view of this government that the motion of sorrow and regret contained in the resolution to which I referred a moment ago is the appropriate response of this national parliament to that issue.That is our view, honestly held. I accept that there are other views in the Australian community that are different, but ours is not a view based on any kind of racial prejudice, it is not a view based on an assumed superior reading of Australian history; it is an honest view as to what the appropriate response is. These are difficult issues. I think all Australians regret many of the things that occurred in the past. There is an overwhelming desire on the part of the Australian community to work to address the root causes of Aboriginal disadvantage: the lack of appropriate standards of education, of health, of employment opportunities, and of housing. They have been the priorities of the government I lead over the last four years, and it is a continued application of those priorities that will give to the indigenous people of Australia a greater opportunity in life and the opportunity to participate fully within the mainstream of the Australian community. I do not think it contributes to the appropriate level of debate in this community for the Leader of the Opposition to seek, as he has done, to impute improper motives to the government. By all means, let the Leader of the Opposition tell me what is wrong in this document. Let the Leader of the Opposition tell me what is wrong with us providing, this year, $2.2 billion, a record amount, to address Aboriginal disadvantage. Let the Leader of the Opposition tell us what was wrong with the literacy and numeracy program that was brought down last week. The Leader of the Opposition talks about division, but the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow minister want to reopen one of the most divisive debates in recent Australian memory, and that is the debate on native title. - The Leader of the Opposition wants to reopen the debate on native title. We believe the debate on native title was resolved by this parliament elected by the Australian people. One of the reasons we rejected the findings of the United Nations committee last week was that, amongst other things, that United Nations committee called for a reopening of the native title issue. I cannot think of anything more divisive than to reopen that issue. All of us knew that it was a potentially explosive issue within the Australian community. All of us knew that when the government reached an understanding with Senator Harradine - no thanks to the Australian Labor Party - we had avoided the consequences of that. The Leader of the Opposition on this occasion has sought to make miserable political capital out of this issue. He ought to be condemned for doing so.</DOC>

 - Last Friday the Prime Minister and the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales signed three additional regional forest agreements covering actually four of the final RFA areas, leaving just one, the southern region, to be completed. That brings to 10 the number of regional forest agreements that this government has concluded since it came to office. That stands in stark contrast with the activities of the previous government, which brought down the national forest policy statement in 1992 but on their defeat in 1996 had not concluded one regional forest agreement.Two of those agreements were signed for the Victoria RFA regions of Gippsland and Victoria west, and I would like to thank the members of parliament from Gippsland, Corangamite, Ballarat, McEwen and Wannon for their assistance in achieving five RFAs now concluded in Victoria. Time and time again those people have been coming to my office promoting the issues relating to both sides of those matters - the green issues and the workers' issues - and they have shown a great dedication to their own electorates in that regard.There have been very substantial additions made in the process of concluding these last two RFAs, because the agency in Victoria discovered that it had been overestimating sustainable yields. We had some suspicion of that. This government decided to conduct an audit and, before that audit was completed, the local state agency had reduced its sustainable yield calculations. That is good conservation policy. But that has created problems in terms of available wood supply, where there has been a reduction of 37,000 cubic metres in the western region and 12,000 in the Gippsland region. The government's response to that was to provide an additional $5 million which, when added to our previous offer of $13.8 million and with state government contribution, had made available $42.6 million - not to kick people out of their jobs, as was proposed in 1992 by the previous Labor government, but to give them the opportunity to better use the remaining resources and to add value to them so there will be no net job losses. I can tell you that every one of those members I named made that a non-negotiable condition to me. They are the ones that did it.I am asked whether alternative proposals have been put to me. I have brought to the attention of the House before the lack of suggestions and of support - in fact, the complete vacuum of policy - coming from the opposition ranks. With one exception, the member for Burke, I am still awaiting my first piece of correspondence. I was thinking that maybe one day the member for Bass would want to put some argument on behalf of the workers who used to pay her wages. It is pretty interesting. I do not even know her Christian name or surname, because I have never seen it on the bottom of a letter. I have got a few memory joggers like that: botanically, you can think of petal, petulance, the member for Dickson - you have all these sorts of things you can do -  - but I do not even know her name. The whole point is that there are no proposals coming from the opposition benches. The CFMEU has applauded our attempts to keep their people in employment; but not one word, not one request.Finally, it is interesting to note the response to our decisions and our ability to get on with this job, when we see people like Senator Brown and Christine Milne of the Greens saying what a dreadful situation is arising with these RFAs and indicating that the forest is being devastated. But then I pick up the Geelong Advertiser and find the letter from Democrat Senator Lyn Allison, complaining that the regrowth of harvested forest in the Ottways is so vigorous that it is reducing water supplies flowing down the hills into dam catchments for Geelong. Why do they do that? There is a concern about water catchment in Geelong, and any argument will do. But you cannot have it both ways. Our policies are producing good production forests and good reserve forests. What is more, on the word of Democrat Senator Allison, the fact of life is that, where forests have been harvested, they are growing back so quickly and so vigorously that they are slowing down water run-off - her words, notwithstanding the truth of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There are three initiatives currently under way in the area of vaccines, all of which should be very positive in terms of protecting Australians from the effects of vaccine preventable illness. The first relates to an announcement we made in April 1998, nearly two years ago, that child-care assistance would be linked to a child's immunisation status. Parents were given plenty of warning of this. It is a serious threat, but we are going to carry through with it, and children who are not fully immunised or whose parents have not signed a conscientious objection form will lose access to child-care assistance.Parents have the right to make the choice of whether to immunise their children or not to immunise their children, but they do not have the right to do nothing. A letter was sent to parents in early February alerting them to this. There were some 65,000 families who had registered for child-care assistance but who had not, on the immunisation register, fully immunised their children. This may overstate the number, because some parents would have registered for child-care assistance but not actually be receiving it. I am pleased to say that since that first letter some 32,000 parents have contacted the childhood immunisation register and have immunised their children. A second letter was sent out in early March. We were to make the cut-off today but we have decided to extend it for one month and send a final registered letter to every one of these 30,000 families, so there will be absolutely no excuse for any parent who does lose child-care assistance for doing absolutely nothing.It is disappointing to see that the opposition, through their shadow minister for family services and the aged, Senator Evans, putting out a press release last week calling on the government to delay its threat to stop child-care benefits for up to 30,000 children who allegedly have not been immunised. A significant point is that this was sent out on the Leader of the Opposition's fax machine six hours after I made the announcement that we were going to do just that. Here is the opposition, with no policies on immunisation at all but prepared just to tag along and, after we make an announcement, six hours later put out a press release calling on us to do exactly what we have done. Secondly, this press release says, `Labor agrees on the desirability of encouraging immunisation in children but that the introduction of this penalty has been rushed.' Given that it was announced in April 1998, two years can hardly be said to be `rushed'. This is just mindless, petty nitpicking on an area that is exceedingly important.The second area of initiative in immunisation is that last week I announced that hepatitis B would be added to the immunisation schedule. Hepatitis B is involved in liver disease, particularly chronic liver failure in carriers, and liver cancer. We have decided to give children an injection at birth and then add it to the immunisation schedule at two months, four months and six months. This is a very positive development, flowing on from the National Health and Medical Research Council's recommendations.But again, I get the same petty nitpicking from the Labor Party, this time from the member for Bruce, saying that children may not get full immunisation as a result of confusion arising from the introduction of the new combination vaccines. This sort of scaring of parents can only contribute to the sort of confusion that we had prior to this government coming in, when 53 per cent of children were fully immunised.The fact is that, while there may be differences between one state and the other, any doctor can access the childhood immunisation register on the web site or they can make a telephone call and get immediate information, or a parent can write and get the information sent to them in the mail. Your intervention in this is disgusting, outrageous and hypocritical, coming from a member of a government that failed to protect children against the most basic of diseases - a complete abrogation of leadership, a complete abrogation of public health.With winter approaching, we have influenza A likely to hit Australia. It hit Europe over the Christmas-New Year period; 20,000 people over 65 years of age died in Europe as the result of influenza A. The third initiative is that this year, for the second time in a row, the government is offering free influenza A vaccine to anyone over 65 years of age or, in recognition of the poor health status of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, anyone over 50 years of age. These vaccinations will help to very substantially moderate the epidemic expected in Australia, and I would very much encourage those people who are eligible to have them.</DOC>

 - I think members of the House would be aware that somebody who worked for the Taxation Office some time ago, Mr Petroulias, has been charged and is awaiting trial, I believe in Melbourne. Under the Australian law, of course, a person is innocent until proven guilty, and it will be a matter for the prosecutors to put the evidence in the court. Comment on the case should be very careful because, again under Australian law, it can often be said that comments, if they are made and are prejudicial, can prejudice a fair trial and not lead to such proceedings.I can advise the House that I have been advised by the Commissioner of Taxation himself that when he became aware of various matters he called in the law enforcement authorities. The law enforcement authorities have conducted a full investigation which has led to the laying of charges, and the matter should now be decided in the courts, as it will be.</DOC>

 - There was nothing inherently easy about the Job Network 2 transition. Some areas have had a high turnover of Job Network members, some former Job Network members have lost contracts, and some continuing Job Network members have had very significant restructurings to manage in just three months. The fact that it has all gone so smoothly is a credit to everyone involved in the delivery of employment services right around the country.The good news is that the transition has been extremely well received, particularly, I am pleased to say, in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Job Network 2 has been greeted by headlines such as `Locals help locals' in the Cooma-Monaro Express, and `New Job Network services' in that well-known publication the Eden-Imlay Magnet. The enthusiasm of the people of Eden-Monaro is not so surprising because in the old days there were just four CES offices in Eden-Monaro. There were 18 Job Network 1 sites, and there are now 36 Job Network 2 sites. Towns such as Jindabyne, Eden, Pambula and Narooma now have separate, individual employment service sites for the first time. Job Network 2 has been generally well received right around the country. For instance, I am sure my friend the member for Greenway was pleased to see in the Blacktown Sun the headline `Network adds six'. Today the government announced further enhancements to Job Network through fee-for-service arrangements at sites such as Nhulunbuy, Thursday Island, Menindee and Wilcannia. All this shows what can be achieved under competitive tendering arrangements. The Leader of the Opposition understands this. He said in his Garran Memorial Lecture in 1994:Today government can also be about purchasing services on behalf of its clients and it will look increasingly to buy from the most efficient supplier, whether from within the public sector or externally.I have been asked about other approaches. The only other approach is coming from the Labor Party's employment spokesman, the member for Dickson, who wants one government owned organisation to be given the `driving role in the delivery of employment services'. So the question is: why should any organisation - Employment National or any other organisation - be given a head start in any competition to provide these services? Job Network members such as the Salvation Army, Mission Employment and Centacare are entitled to know why the Labor Party thinks Employment National should get the inside running in any future Job Network tender. They are entitled to ask that question, and the member for Dickson should provide an answer very quickly.</DOC>

And, while it was recommended by my department that I should fund it, I have asked that the Health Technology Advisory Committee run its course. As for the resignation of individual members, I am not aware of that. I do not have anything to do with the day to day running of these consultative committees. While I am the responsible minister, I do not involve myself with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note his interest in it and the interest of others, such as the member for Cowper, of course, who has endlessly campaigned for this road. It really ought to be called the `Garry Nehl Highway'.Last week work commenced on replacing the deadliest stretch on the entire Pacific Highway with a four-lane $348 million freeway. It is a 29-kilometre stretch, from Yelgun to Chinderah. It is a deviation which will bypass the notorious Burringbar Range section. It will certainly make a very big difference in terms of safety for motorists. But it will be more than that: it will be an upgrade which will improve transport linkages very significantly, especially for the burgeoning North Coast, ably represented, of course, by the members for Page and for Richmond. And, of course, the member for Richmond, Larry Anthony, was on site to officially launch the project just last week.This is actually the largest single project in the $3.1 billion Pacific Highway upgrading program. It delivers a priority election commitment for this government. This is the road that the coalition built, that the ALP had no capacity to fund. This is the road that was left out in the cold because in 1991 the now Leader of the Opposition decided that the Commonwealth ought to get out of important regional roads of this sort. They would not touch it. That does not stop, of course, the member for Paterson - out there every day proclaiming the value of the road that the coalition is building. He is out there every day saying it is wonderful. I simply ask him to do the decent thing and point out that if his team were still in power the road would simply never have been funded.</DOC>

 - I have known Dr McLean for some time. He is a highly talented person. A nuclear medicine physician is a highly appropriate person to be heading the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA. He is doing an excellent job. Given what someone in private practice earns, $25,000 per annum for the chair of this is a tiny amount of  money. I would also say that nuclear medicine is quite different -  - Is there a conflict of interest? I do not believe so. I do not see what ARPANSA really has to do with PET scanning, other than it produces isotopes. The two are quite separate. - Well, ARPANSA is what he is chairman of. Finally, you asked me: was he one of the radiologists involved in MRI? Nuclear medicine physicians have got nothing to do with radiology. They are separately trained. One are physicians; one are radiologists. You obviously do not know the difference, and you are a complete dope!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and for the keen interest that she takes in the delivery of ever improved employment services to her electorate. A few years back, any job seeker entering the CES had access to, at most, a few hundred jobs listed on cards on notice boards. It was, I am afraid, despite the best will in the world of CES staff, the `Jurassic Park'of job seeking. These days, Australian Job Search, the government's national jobs database, has become a national electronic notice board available through more than 3,000 touch screens around the country and also through the Internet. I am pleased to say that every day Australian Job Search receives nearly 400,000 hits on the Internet, making it by far the most visited employment site in Australia.In the past 12 months Australian Job Search has been very significantly upgraded so that it now amounts to a virtual labour exchange. First, there was the lodge-a-job facility enabling employers to automatically lodge their own jobs through the Net. Then we had the lodge-a-resume facility allowing job seekers to put their resumes, without any middleman or intermediary, on the Net. Next we had a resume search facility enabling employers to search the database for suitable potential employees themselves. This is world-class technology and it has been acknowledged as such by honourable mention from the Smithsonian Institute, as well as by more than three special awards here in Australia. Three weeks ago the government announced a very significant new Internet based service called Job Outlook, which will enable job seekers, with one click on the Internet, to access updated information about employment growth and job prospects in nearly 400 separate occupations.I have been asked about alternative policies. A couple of weeks before the latest announcement, the member for Dickson launched a pamphlet called Workplace 2010. This was not a policy; it was in fact a forecast, she said, of where jobs might be. The only policy the member for Dickson had was to demand that the government post this printed document to all schools. I am pleased to say that the government have done a lot better than that. We have made more extensive, more refined and much more immediate information available to everyone through the Internet. Even on the member for Dickson's own interpretation of these events, it took us two weeks to deliver something which apparently the Labor Party had been working on since March last year. The government are delivering not only their own policies but even Labor's policies - where they are any good. The member for Dickson had better go back to the drawing board and come up with something original.</DOC>

 - As I understand it, that is in shorthand called the `Brown bill'. The Brown bill deals with mandatory sentencing in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The position of the government in relation to these matters is well known. We believe that ultimately these matters ought to be within the legislative competence of the parliaments of the state and territory concerned.It remains, however, the case that I and many members of the government take the view that the principle of mandatory sentencing is flawed. We have particular concerns about the operation of the mandatory sentencing laws of the Northern Territory as far as they affect juveniles. In fact, shortly before question time I spoke to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. I indicated to him that we continue to have significant concerns about the operation of the mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory - consistent, however, with the government's view that, in the end, it is within the legislative competence of the Northern Territory to finally resolve these matters - and that the government does not believe in using the legislative power of the Commonwealth to override the Northern Territory law.Nonetheless, there are serious concerns the government has, and the Chief Minister has agreed to meet me to discuss those concerns. That meeting will be taking place shortly. Amongst other things, we will be exploring during that meeting the suitability of diversionary programs and other initiatives which were dealt with in part in the Senate committee report, and we will discuss a range of other concerns the government has. I said to the Chief Minister that, in the spirit of cooperative relations between the Commonwealth and the Territory that ought to characterise these matters, I expected the Northern Territory government to take seriously the Commonwealth's concerns. That is consistent with the view that I have put for some time that, although I respect the ultimate legislative right of local communities in these matters, I personally, and many members of my government and many members of the government parties, have significant concerns about both the principle of mandatory sentencing and the operation of those laws insofar as they affect juveniles. Insofar as the Brown bill is concerned, I think we have indicated a disposition in the past not to debate that. With no disrespect to the member for Calare regarding what I might loosely call the `Andren bill', if there is a proposal that that matter be dealt with, then I invite those who might want it to be discussed to seek a suspension of standing orders.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I can tell the honourable member that recently the Chairman of the New Tax Advisory Board and the Commissioner of Taxation have announced procedures which will mean more simplification in relation to business filling out their business activity statement and remitting GST. I remind the House that the business activity statement is a two-page statement on which business can not only remit GST but also remit group tax, fringe benefits tax, luxury car tax and wine equalisation tax, if that applies. It also allows the pay-as-you-go tax remittance, which replaces the reportable payment system, the prescribed payment system, provisional tax, company tax and a whole lot of other tax reporting regimes which bog business down at the moment. The simplification which has been announced in relation to GST is that, instead of having to show sales and GST which applies to the sales and then inputs and the input tax credit, if you have a sufficient accounting system you can move straight to the bottom lines of the tax payable on sales and the input tax credit on purchases, which means essentially that you can go straight off your accounting system to those two lines.I also remind the House that as part of goods and services tax the government is introducing pay-as-you-go tax. As you can see from the business activity statement, the pay as you go is calculated directly off the GST return. You recall that at the last election the Labor Party said it was against GST but in favour of pay as you go, which would have required every business to fill in a GST return even though there would have been no GST - another one of the clever policies of the Australian Labor Party. Pay as you go is calculated off the GST return of sales and inputs, and the Labor Party, in its wisdom, decided it would have pay as you go without the GST return. Plainly ridiculous and plainly nonsense. These are good, new measures for small business. They are part of the modernisation of the Australian taxation system. Remember this: up until 30 June, Labor is opposed to goods and services tax and on 1 July becomes in favour of it. So, presumably, we have to put up with another three months of Labor opposition while this government does all the hard work, with the Labor Party intending to take benefit from it after 1 July. This is good; this is simplification. I welcome the fact that Labor is going to support pay as you go and GST after 30 June. I only regret the fact that you have been so lazy as to make this government do all the work on the issue in the interim.</DOC>

 - The leader of the Australian Labor Party talking about a free vote is an absolute contradiction in terms. The Labor Party has been so hypocritical on a free vote. I remember that some years ago it took an absolutely impassioned speech from the then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Lionel Bowen -  - to prevent an ALP conference from denying people a free vote on abortion. That is how absolutely contemptuous they are of it. The answer is: you move your suspension and you will find out everything in due time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. The government has the biggest information and education program ever implemented for the introduction of a much better tax system for the small business community, including $12 billion worth of income tax cuts, which will be a great help to small business, as well as the abolition of wholesale sales tax. One of the things I particularly like is the abolition of provisional tax, which has been the bane of the life of many small business people. Specifically to assist with the transition - it is a big job for small business, which we recognise - we have a $500 million program supplemented by an additional $175 million for GST related expenditure. Part of that $500 million program is a scheme which will see the posting of officers to various area consultative committees to assist small business on the ground in local regions - to signpost them and direct them to sources of advice as small business grapples with the transition. I welcome those people who have taken up those appointments and who are in Canberra this week going through a final training and information session to prepare them.We also have a program of certificates which look like this one: these are direct assistance. They will probably be a collector's item. These are worth $200 but, in addition to the monetary value, we have commitments from lots of suppliers to provide goods and services at a discounted fee, for small business in particular as they get themselves ready for the GST. The Treasurer announced yesterday that over one million ABNs have now gone through -  - One million applications. Over 800,000 ABNs have actually been issued. Once they have been issued, as the process moves through, we send out these certificates worth $200. So far there have been 693,074 direct assistance certificates sent, worth approximately $138 million, which is a practical help to small business as they move to the new system.This is part and parcel of a much better system for small business, a simpler system of tax administration which of course compares very favourably with that of the Labor Party, who want to keep all the old systems in place. They want to keep prescribed payments, reportable payments, provisional tax - all the old system. That is their policy. Then, when you put a bit of heat on them, they say, `We are so opposed to this policy that when we are elected we are going to keep it.' They are so opposed to the GST they are going to keep it. But, just to add hypocrisy upon hypocrisy, they have another proposal for small business: once you have got used to the GST, the Labor Party are not only going to roll back your income tax cuts but are also going to introduce a whole lot more exemptions, which means a whole lot more red tape for small business. There is no comparison. There is one side that is pro small business - not just because small business is good but also because of the jobs that it creates - and that is the coalition.</DOC>

 - Whilst I cannot testify to which bit was seen by which group of people over a period of time, my -  - My understanding, from what I have been told, is that the procedure was as follows. The document was, as would be appropriate with a document of this kind, drafted in the Indigenous Affairs Unit in my department, where they report and work to Senator Herron. It was sent to Senator Herron's office. There were, so I am told, some changes - but, in the overall scheme of things, not big changes - made by the minister, as is appropriate. It was then that what I think was a fairly late draft - it may not have been the final draft - was cleared through my office. It was not seen by me. In fact I did not see the document until after it had been reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph and in other papers. I do not deny - in fact, it has been acknowledged from the very beginning; I think I have answered this question before - that it was certainly seen by somebody in my office. Yes, there is no secret about that. - The document was seen -  - The unbelievable from Hotham is intervening and saying `those words'. I am not as good as you, Simon - speaking ironically, of course. I am not as good as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I do not have a capacity to know, every moment of every day of every week, every word that every person in my department or on my staff reads. All I can say is that we followed a normal procedure - I guess, a procedure that may in fact have been followed by the Labor Party when it was in office. The document, from the chain of events that I have described, was plainly not inspired for political wedge purposes; otherwise it would not have been drafted in the indigenous branch office. That really is the beginning and the end of the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and for his deep interest in regional policy. In addition to the Job Network and Work for the Dole - two major government policies which have worked to the great benefit of regional Australia - my department also administers the $40 million per year Regional Assistance Program. Under the Regional Assistance Program, the government makes small, carefully targeted grants to local employment generating projects. I have to say that this is not a `Canberra knows best' program. Every cent that is spent under the Regional Assistance Program grants is made on the recommendations of area consultative committees of my department, comprising local business and community leaders.Last week the government announced an additional $7.2 million in Regional Assistance Program grants for 147 new projects right around Australia. I will just mention three: $30,000 for an abalone plant in Narooma, $50,000 for the Avon Industrial Park in Western Australia, and $100,000 for the Ceduna Marina in South Australia. The Regional Assistance Program is designed to build constructive partnerships between state, local and federal governments and between local business; and I am pleased to say that the $7.2 million in federal funding attracted an additional $8.1 million in partnership funding from other sources. There are a lot of good things going on in regional Australia at the moment - a lot of good things happening as people turn problems into opportunities, as people meet the challenges of adjustment and globalisation, and many of these projects are being assisted by the Regional Assistance Program. I have been asked about alternative policies for regional areas. The truth is that there are no alternative policies. A policy evolution in the Australian Labor Party is like watching the Marie Celeste sail off into the Bermuda Triangle. However, what can you expect from a weak leader who has an opinion on everything but a policy on nothing, and needs a personal trainer to improve his policy as well as his fitness. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can give the honourable member some advice off the top of my head. I was very concerned about eye health, and I asked Professor Hugh Taylor to review Aboriginal eye health. I must say his report, which I released publicly some time ago, was deeply disturbing. It showed that today, in many parts of Australia, we are no better off than we were 20 years ago when Fred Hollows did his pioneering work. The point is that you were in government for 13 of those years, and there has been no progress in this area. - The member for Jagajaga asks what we have done. I would say the first thing we have done is put azithromycin on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has led to a great increase in the ability to treat eye disease amongst Aboriginal people.There is a problem relating to surgeons. The problem relates to how we pay people who operate in public hospitals, and of course the payment for non-insured patients in public hospitals has always been the province of state governments. We have hit a brick wall here because the state government in Queensland is refusing to treat its Aboriginal constituents in the same way as it treats all other constituents. I think this is outrageous and a scandal. So I would say to the honourable member: perhaps you could use some of your influence with your Labor Party colleagues in Queensland and see if they would treat the Aboriginal citizens the way they treat everybody else.</DOC>

 - As always, comments made by us on this side are taken out of context. I have read the Treasurer's comment. What he was referring to as being no bad thing was the growing strength of the world economy, and the idea that that is a bad thing could only be generated in the mind of an economic spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, because you people were the kings of the depressed Australian economy. I want to make one other observation on the interest rate issue and to remind the parliament - and in particular remind those who sit opposite - of the level of interest rates that obtained under the former government. The combined effect of interest rate movements since this government came to office means that the average Australian homebuyer is now $250 a month better off than that homebuyer would have been if the interest rate regime that we inherited from you incompetent lot had continued.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. As the Prime Minister said, the Reserve Bank today increased official interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 5¾ per cent, which is a full one per cent tightening; as has been the case in Europe where there was a full one per cent tightening, in New Zealand where there has been a full one per cent tightening, in the United Kingdom where there has been a full one per cent tightening, and in the United States where interest rates have been tightened by 1.25 per cent. The Australian official cash rate stands lower than that of the United Kingdom and the United States.As the Prime Minister said, when this government was elected home variable mortgage interest rates were at 10.5 per cent. Even after today's movement, they would be at 7.55 per cent, meaning that on the standard Australian interest only loan you are saving today $250 a month on your interest bill, compared with the interest rates which applied when this government came into office, which is a $3,000 a year saving for the average Australian family over the course of the last four years since March 1996. In addition, unemployment has come down to 6.7 per cent, inflation has been low, Australia has survived the Asian financial crisis, and over the last 11 quarters the economy has grown at four per cent per annum, something that we had not done for 30 years. As the Prime Minister said, one of the consequences of a stronger world environment - which will be good for Australia - is that interest rates are going up in all countries around the world. As I said before, the main ones are the European Central Bank and the English speaking economies of New Zealand, the US and the UK. I have seen a claim made - and it was not a claim made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but I have seen a claim made by a much lesser economic authority - that this is all a consequence of the Australian GST. Presumably, the US Fed is moving interest rates because of the Australian GST; presumably, Eddie George at the Bank of England is moving rates because of the GST; presumably, Mr Duisenberg of the European Central Bank is moving interest rates because of the Australian GST; and presumably, Don Brash sits down there in New Zealand and moves New Zealand's interest rates because of the GST. No, the Reserve Bank Governor said that the central bank in Australia was tightening, as was happening around the world. There is only one so-called economic authority, fired up by his pollster, who went out today to make the rather extraordinary claim that interest rates - which are rising around the world - are being caused by the Australian GST. I fully expect that, if there is an earthquake in Ecuador, according to the Leader of the Opposition it is the Australian GST and if there is a flood in Nicaragua, according to the Leader of the Opposition it is the Australian GST.He made inter alia this particular claim today, that a further impact was a substantial slash on the budget. Apparently he is also against that, because he believes that that will be bad for interest rates. What he calls a substantial slash on the budget is an income tax cut. That is what it is; an income tax cut. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition going out campaigning against income tax cuts, campaigning against the GST - which he is so against that, if he ever becomes Prime Minister, he wants to keep it - and adding to the net sum of economic wisdom around the world by saying that interest rates, which have risen in the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Europe, are all caused by the Australian GST. It is totally poll driven and totally lacking in any economic credibility.The good news, to finish the quote that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so wilfully tried to misrepresent, of a growing world economy is that a growing world economy will be good for Australia. It will give us additional export volumes, and it will give us additional export values. The consequence of that is that you will see growth moving out of consumer demand and into exports, something that was shown up by recent figures and we would expect to be shown up by figures on the trade front over the course of the next two years.</DOC>

 - The elements of economic policy that the government put in place when it came to office included not only the concept but the practice of independence for the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank of Australia has a much greater level of independence to set monetary policy today than it had under any previous government in Australia. In that sense, it has followed the practice of other governments around the world. One of the first acts of Gordon Brown, I think, when he became Chancellor in Tony Blair's government was to hand over the control of monetary policy to the Bank of England. But one thing I can be certain of is this: no Treasurer in any government I lead, no member of any government I lead, will make the claim made by the former member for Blaxland - I do not know whether he was Prime Minister then or Treasurer - when he said that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. Nothing did more damage to the concept that there was some integrity in the conduct of monetary policy than making a statement like that. Can I say for the record that I believe that the current Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, is doing a first-rate job. I think one of the things that has contributed to the economic strength and the great economic prosperity of this country over the last few years has been the skilful conduct of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank. I notice today that the Governor issued a statement. It was quite a lengthy statement, and I think it provides a very good explanation for the rationale of the decision taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Monetary policy is an important element of economic prosperity and economic stability, and it is inevitable that adjustments in monetary policy will take account of national and international financial circumstances. What the Governor has done today, very usefully, has been to put into full context the decision taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia. I congratulate the Governor on the contribution that he has made in that very senior and important position to the stability and the strength of the Australian financial system.Australia was able to stare down the Asian economic downturn, and the frantic prediction of the Leader of the Opposition on the AM program on 3 September 1998 was not realised. When the Leader of the Opposition criticised some growth figures, he said:These are not a beautiful set of numbers ... they're an indication of a substantial problem ...Then he went on to say, characteristically:And remember, we haven't really been hit by the Asian crisis yet. We don't get hit by the Asian crisis until these next two or three years.In other words, the Leader of the Opposition was desperately hoping that Australia might be hit by the Asian economic crisis, once again hoping for some bad economic luck for Australia. One of the reasons that this country was not hit by the Asian economic crisis was that we had a very strong, well-supervised, prudentially regulated, transparent banking system. The contribution that successive Reserve Bank governors - and particularly the current one - have made to the stability of the Australian financial system is something that deserves credit on both sides of this House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I am delighted to answer it. In short, the $1 billion social bonus that the coalition has put together out of the partial sale of Telstra is now delivering some extraordinarily valuable initiatives in rural and regional Australia. A very large part of that is, of course, the $464 million Networking the Nation program. That is part of the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, and it has funded now no less than 235 projects across Australia. A vast array of rural communities really can benefit from more innovative approaches to telecommunications of a sort that were never possible under Labor and would not have been impossible without this initiative.I had the great pleasure of launching one of them the other day, Growzone. Growzone covers an area of 28 per cent of Queensland, much of it in the electorates of Groom and of Maranoa. It runs from Toowoomba right out to the Birdsville corner. There are no less than 37 towns there that will now have access to the Internet at reasonable rates. It raises the prospect, extraordinary as it may sound, of the producers of organically grown beef in the Channel Country - one of the most remote parts of Australia; indeed, of the world - being able to communicate instantly and on the spot with their customers in Japan, the sort of thing that would not have been thought possible at all a few short years ago and would never have been possible with the ALP's approach to telecommunications innovation in regional areas, with their constant obstruction of the machinery that we have put in place to allow these things to happen. The $2.6 million grant has been very well used by those who put together this program. They are already directly employing 15 people but, with the 37 towns across southern and south-west Queensland - including Charleville, Dirranbandi, Quilpie, Chinchilla, Roma, Cunnamulla, Goondiwindi and eventually places like Birdsville - that will now have such things as public access terminals, the employment prospects are really very serious indeed. These are the sorts of innovative approaches which are going to revolutionise the future for people living in rural and regional Australia. The member for Barker also asked whether I was aware of any alternative approaches. Yes, I am. The ALP have made it quite plain that they regard this as a hotchpotch approach which they would wind back or obliterate in government. They stand condemned. There is no doubt about them. If they see a good service delivery out there - whether, for example, it is Networking the Nation or closing down 270 post offices - they will roll it back.</DOC>

 - The proposition that the reduction in fuel costs of around 23c a litre that we will be putting in place from 1 July and the proposition that the abolition of the wholesale sales tax on trucks, parts and tyres and all the equipment that goes with that will not deliver substantial benefits is absolutely absurd. It is just a total absurdity. I note, and I am sure that all members would note this, that regrettably the rise we are seeing in crude oil prices - which the government has absolutely no control over - is something that we hope will not last indefinitely. We look forward to an easing of those crude oil prices, which I acknowledge are putting pressure on transport operators at the moment. But to somehow extrapolate from that that the benefits from our tax reforms for transport will not be huge is absolutely extraordinary.It is interesting that the member for Hotham asked this particular question, because we now know what the opposition's attitude is towards reductions in fuel excise. We have, of course, had previous indications from the member for Dickson, who described them as nothing more than a multibillion dollar boost to pollution, a view not repudiated by the new spokesman for regional areas. But more recently we had - and I cannot help reading this into the Hansard - an interviewer asking Mr Crean about fuel excise. `What about fuel excise, Mr Crean?' the interviewer asked. `That causes a lot of problems, too. What sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?' The response from Mr Crean was, `Basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect and direct taxes. We always had fuel excise in that mix' - and here is the cut-through line - `and we were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime. That wasn't the issue.' </DOC>

 - I can inform the honourable member for Sturt that on 25 February the Federal Court delivered a final judgment requiring the Commonwealth to pay some $761,594.13 for legal costs incurred by the member for Fremantle in connection with the Marks royal commission and her related court challenges in respect of that royal commission. The judgment makes it clear that staff members of the then Prime Minister and the then health minister had bound the Commonwealth contractually to payment of such legal costs. In fact those commitments by such staff members were subsequently ratified by the then Labor cabinet on 8 June in 1995.A number of members of this House, past and present, have served at various levels in state governments prior to entering this parliament, and I am indeed one those. I would believe the majority of us, while serving in this House, would not have the slightest expectation that, should proceedings be instituted in respect of our former administration in a state government, the Commonwealth budget would be required to pay the legal costs in respect of those proceedings. The role of any minister in this parliament has absolutely no relevance to the previous responsibilities of a minister in a state parliament.A few weeks ago, the Attorney-General called upon the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence defence fund to provide approximately $100,000 that was collected in that cause towards the payment of legal costs. The Attorney-General has received a response dated 22 March from Mr Gray, indicating that no contribution would be made. This whole episode, which now requires the Commonwealth taxpayers to pick up the tab, is new territory. It is not only unprecedented; it is also a shameful step in public administration. But I can inform the honourable member for Sturt and members of the House that I will shortly introduce a special appropriation bill into the House to meet the Commonwealth's liability under the Federal Court judgment. In other words, the Australian taxpayers will pick up the bill. I repeat: this is a shameful episode in public administration. It demonstrates to the Australian people once again that Labor operates under the principle of whatever it takes. Of course, Labor has nothing but contempt for the Australian taxpayers.</DOC>

 - I have already, in the course of the past few days, answered a number of questions and made a number of comments about this issue, both in the parliament and elsewhere. If the Leader of the Opposition seeks to further pursue the argument, I would simply say to him that what I have said represents my attitude. It acknowledges gross injustices having been practised in the past against indigenous Australians. It also recognises that the overwhelming desire of the Australian community now is to see all Australians working together on a basis of equality of opportunity and a recognition of the particular place of the indigenous people within our community. The Leader of the Opposition may, for his own purposes, seek to pursue the issue in particular. He is welcome to do that. I can do no more than draw his attention, which I do, to the remarks I have made in the parliament over the past few days and the remarks I have made elsewhere.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. The Australian workplace agreements, which can be either individual or collective, were introduced in the Workplace Relations Act in 1996 and started in early 1997. As of the end of March, 98,699 have been approved. We are well on the way to reaching a milestone in the development of this new option for people, with the approval of 100,000 in the next week or so. They have been a very successful option for people. They have allowed for new productivity flexibility, they have allowed for family friendly work practices, they have allowed for rostering flexibility and they have allowed for performance pay, just to mention some of the new features which are part and parcel of this new form of agreement.They are under threat - there is no doubt about that - even though the concept is well entrenched now and is being taken up right across the Australian community. They are under threat from the former trade union officials who sit opposite. I have read a report in the last few days that the issue of Australian workplace agreements and individual contracts would be up before the federal executive of the Labor Party on Friday this week. The report was to the effect that Labor's attitude to individual agreements is in the balance. We know it is a question mark as a policy issue. - Thank you. This is exactly the point I am making. I was going to quote Doug Cameron saying the other day that you cannot have AWAs. It must be that the Leader of the Opposition read it, because he has announced his policy already - no AWAs. So you are going to deny tens of thousands of Australian workers the right to have an agreement that suits them. This is ideology at its worst, taking Australia back into the sixties and the seventies. You already have the unions giving you your public marching instructions. When you go down to your federal executive on Friday, as soon as you walk in, the first bloke you will meet will be Joe de Bruyn. He is from the shoppies. - When the Leader of the Opposition fronts up on Friday to the ALP executive, he will be met by Joe de Bruyn from the shoppies union. -  - These are the members of your executive. These are the people who tell you what your policy is. These are the people who dictate policy to you. - You, Mr Speaker, will not be at this meeting, I can assure you of that. He will meet Janice Mayes from the Australian Services Union, Margaret Sexton from the CPSU and Greg Sword from the National Union of Workers. Out of the 21 people on that executive, two-thirds are from the unions. You are going to the unions to ask them what their policy is on AWAs. - We have now flushed out a policy from the Leader of the Opposition. He is opposed to allowing people to have Australian workplace agreements. I appreciate that we now have a clear difference. We are prepared to give people an option. The opposition are going to say that for the 100,000 people who have AWAs, they are out. They are going to deny them the option that any Australian ought to have.</DOC>

 - Regarding the remarks that I made at the launch, that is certainly not my understanding. It was not the advice I had. I stand completely by the remarks I made because there was absolutely no intention on my part to mislead. The program represented, on my understanding and on my advice, the commitment out of the overall literacy and numeracy program of specific resources to lift the standards of indigenous literacy and numeracy within the Australian community. That was the advice that I had from both my own department -  -  - I have already said that the money came out of the overall literacy and numeracy allocation. There was absolutely no deception at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest and considerable background in aviation. We are pressing ahead with modernising Australia's air safety systems in a measured and sensible way. I would in particular like to draw the House's attention to the fact that the airspace reform program is scheduled to be completed in June 2001. The government, having learnt various lessons, including those that could be drawn out of the G airspace demonstration, are continuing to modernise Australia's airspace - it is an important part of our national transport infrastructure - and we are doing so in a staged way to ensure that industry can handle appropriately the changes as they are made. Airservices has phased out the manual traffic information or DTI arrangements that we used in the low level airspace between Bass Strait and Ballina. It has replaced, too, the 1950s vintage procedures with air traffic controllers using the award winning system, TAAATS. TAAATS is now fully operational. I have drawn the attention of the House to this matter before, and I reiterate that we all ought to be very proud that this is quite simply and without any doubt the most advanced air traffic control system in the world. That is something that we can all be very proud of. The new arrangements increase the safety of air travel in regional Victoria and New South Wales. Under the procedural arrangements in times gone by, the flight service officers did not use radar to provide information to pilots, even in areas where there was radar coverage. In contrast, the air traffic controllers now use radar where it is available to provide better and more accurate traffic information. Airservices will phase out the last of the manual traffic information systems used in Australia by December of this year. The final stage of the airspace reform program is scheduled to be completed by June 2001.There are other important reforms going on. I have recently appointed a new consultative body, the Aviation Safety Forum, and it will provide strategic advice direct to CASA. It will, I believe, act as a useful and, I have to say, needed bridge between CASA and the industry. We are pushing ahead with regulatory reform. For example, we have announced the new rating for private pilots - the private instrument flight rules rating - which will reduce accidents caused by light aircraft attempting to dodge around clouds. AOPA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, has actually commented that `the whole concept is quite revolutionary and the development team have done a great job'. Of interest to people in rural and regional areas is the fact that we have reduced the duty on fuel used in small planes by 85 per cent since we came to power in 1996. Under Labor, the duty on Avgas was 18½c a litre. It is now 2.8c a litre, a reduction of 15.7c a litre. We slashed the duty in 1998. We made a modest increase of 9.77c last year to ensure a very important service delivery objective - that was that Airservices Australia could maintain affordable tower service provisions at 15 regional and general aviation airports, including centres like Tamworth, where, if we had not taken that action, the landing fees would have increased from under $7 a tonne to nearly $40 a tonne. We are pressing ahead in a sensible way with aviation reforms that will benefit the travelling public in this country in a very real way. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the importance that the honourable member places on the prosperity of the exporters from has electorate and the one in five jobs that Australia's export effort provides to rural and regional Australians. I know this is a message that the honourable member, as well as all members of the government, is going to continue to provide. Today I presented to the parliament and released publicly the government's Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement - the fourth in the series. Since we have been in office we have continued to release details of what has been achieved in trade in the previous 12 months and the objectives for the upcoming 12 months. An integral part of what we are doing as far as our export effort is concerned in the year 2000 is improving Australia's taxation system - improvements that all Australians, particularly the business community, have been calling for. Changes in the taxation system will see more than $3.5 billion a year worth of indirect and embedded taxes carved away and taken off the backs of Australia's exporters. It is a policy that has been continually opposed by the Labor Party. They have continually opposed and talked down the benefits of tax reform as far as Australia's exporters are concerned.   - Everybody except the member for Fraser. The member for Fraser is the only member of the ALP who has acknowledged the benefits for exporters of the GST. He said, `Well, the GST overall should be good for exporters.' He was being quite honest when he went on to say, `I'm not a fan of the GST, as you might imagine, but if there is one thing that is a plus for it, it should help our exporters.' Indeed it will. I agree with the member for Fraser - it will help our exporters. Over the last couple of years we have managed the economy of Australia through very difficult international circumstances, such as the economic downturn in South-East Asia and East Asia, and our exporters maintained a level last year of $114 billion in exports. They have done that carrying the burden of the embedded taxes that the Labor Party wants to keep and that the Labor Party kept on increasing. We all remember the budget of 1993. We want to remove that burden, and we are going to do that on 1 July. The manufacturer of Malibu boats in Albury indicated to me in February this year that, as of 1 July, because of the GST, he is going to be selling his product at 1997 prices. He is going to get a net reduction in the cost of producing that product. He cannot wait for 1 July to arrive. He is asking the question, `Why is the Australian Labor Party opposing a policy that is going to see that happen?' Where is the policy from the Labor Party? All Australian exporters are asking, `Where is the Labor Party policy?' At the moment the shadow spokesman for trade is on a five-week tour through Europe. While he is in Europe, he is announcing policies on China as far as Australia's trade circumstance is concerned. I suppose he will go to China and announce their policy on Europe, but he will not announce any policies back here in Australia and we have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition how the ALP propose to improve the circumstance for Australian exporters and make them more competitive, as we will as of 1 July.</DOC>

 - Given the detailed nature of the question, I would have to take on notice the specifics raised, but it gives me an opportunity to remind the House that there was a commitment of $63 million made I think towards the end of 1997 within about six or seven months of the publication of the HREOC report. I do not think under any circumstances that could be seen as unreasonable or unfair, given the character of the report and the particular recommendations that were made. The honourable member knows, as do all people in this House who have sat in government, that there are reasons why, after a commitment of money is made, you do not expend every last dollar of it within the first few weeks. It does take time. As to the particular reasons, I do not have them in mind. I will find out, and as appropriate I will come back to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I commend him for the leadership he has shown in his local area on this issue. We have had a concerted effort to address mental health matters over the last four years and Australia has had very significant international credit for it. Last week I launched a program that we have called MindMatters that we use amongst secondary school children in Australia. It came out of a national schools audit in 1996 that showed there were very significant barriers to dealing with mental health problems in Australian schools. This is an innovative resource for teachers to address and promote in the classroom mental health and suicide prevention. It is a sad reality that up to 20 per cent of Australian children may experience a mental illness in their teenage years; the most common of these is depression. It affects people particularly up to 18 years of age. Students may feel that there is no way out, that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.The materials that I am talking about were developed by a consortium. We tested them in 24 Australian schools in 1998 and 1999, and they have tested extraordinarily well. They relate to a range of materials for teachers and schools and are particularly designed to help increase the resilience of children and to give them skills to cope with challenges, change and stress. They also show how a school may take a whole of school approach to issues of harassment, understanding mental illness and helping students with loss and grief. It is a truly national project that is being coordinated by the Australian Principals Association and the Curriculum Corporation. There is no easy solution to the issue of suicide. The member has raised with me the issue of a summit in Frankston in May, and I hope materials such as these that have been thoroughly tested do give people at that summit some hope for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler. Honourable members would know that the member for Hinkler represents one of Australia's foremost horticultural regions. Indeed, I was happy to join him for a dinner last Saturday night near Bundaberg to celebrate the achievements of the horticultural industry.  - Indeed, the horticultural industry has a lot to celebrate, Mr Speaker, as you would well know. It has been one of the real success stories of Australian agriculture, with tremendous boosts in exports and considerable growth in employment in the industry. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has put a lot of effort into opening up new markets, and the rewards for its science based quarantine system have been significant. The House would be interested to know that since 1993-94 AQIS has succeeded in having technical barriers to our exports removed in 275 commodity market combinations. That represents significant new marketing opportunities. AQIS has improved conditions for export access in 96 cases and in a further 257 cases where our exports have been put at risk because of threats from other countries they have been able to negotiate continuing access. So there have been some really significant breakthroughs, which have helped our horticultural industry in electorates like Hinkler and right around Australia to expand their exports and to develop job opportunities and build regional economies.  I am particularly pleased to report to the House today that Australia is at the point of a major breakthrough in relation to exports of citrus. Mr Speaker, this would interest you particularly because the citrus growers of the Riverland have the potential to be major beneficiaries of a likely agreement with South Korea to allow access for Australian citrus into that very important market. This will be the first time that fresh Australian fruit has been allowed into Korea. The citrus industry has also been one of the great successes of the horticultural sector. Their exports have tripled since 1994-95 and are now worth almost $150 million. Soon I expect the people of South Korea will have the benefit of being able to enjoy citrus produced in the Riverland - and hopefully my own electorate, because we do produce some of the very best citrus in the world. It is great to have these new market opportunities available to our producers. </DOC>

 - Perhaps I could answer the question in two ways. The first way I can answer the question is in five words: Rod Cameron and Bill Hunter. The second way I can answer the question is in a slightly more detailed fashion, and that is to refer to the question of who hired that particular firm -  - which is made up of three principals - one of whom, Mr Jackson, was the Labor candidate for the seat of Mackellar in 1983, and in fact at the show down the road he was accompanied by his good friend Kerry Sibraa, regardless of stories of meetings of the Narrabeen branch of the Australian Labor Party. The other two principals of course are well known. If that firm gets some contracts on a proper basis, like any other firm it has a right to. - I do not run away from my association with Graham Morris and I never will. I never run away from associations with people who have demonstrated a loyalty and commitment to me on a personal basis over the years. I make it very plain that -  -  - I do not quite know where the opposition believes this fascinating line of questioning is going. I think, like somebody said, this is character assassination. This idea that somebody, because they have worked for, and had an association with, a Prime Minister, is denied the opportunity of making a living -  - The member for Lilley asked me about how a particular firm was engaged and he named that particular firm. The whole purpose of naming it was to invoke the association between me and Graham Morris. That is why he asked the question. He sought to smear Graham Morris - a decent person who has a right to make a living. As far as I am concerned, I am proud of my friendship with Graham Morris.  - I warned the member for Lilley that there was a short answer and a long answer. On the engagement of the firm, I know nothing of the processes whereby the firm was engaged - nothing at all. As to the question of whether Mr McClure can come along and address a Liberal Party conference, I do not think that in any way compromises his independence. I am quite certain he would be happy to go along and address the Labor caucus. I do not think anybody has suggested that, for example, Stuart McIntyre's independence as an Australian historian of note was compromised by the fact that he gave some kind of centenary address to a meeting of the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party. This idea that somebody cannot preserve their independence just because they address a committee is absolutely ridiculous.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to advise the member for Robertson that an additional 767 Centrelink call centre staff, both permanent and temporary, will be recruited up until July as part of the government's new tax system. These people will be placed in Centrelink call centres and Family Assistance Offices right across urban and regional Australia. They will provide a vital service to Australians who are seeking more information about the new taxation system. The changes to income assistance will help families and people receiving pensions, other payments and allowances. The changes to family assistance payments will provide more help with the cost of raising children. Twelve complex payments now will be reduced to a simplified three new payments. Not only is the coalition government increasing income support payments, but it is introducing more generous income tests for more families. Families now will be able to choose to receive their payment either as a lump sum or as a reduction in their tax instalments. - Retired Australians will also benefit under the new tax system with the one-off savings bonuses. On 1 July, the age pension savings bonus will provide up to $1,000 to Australians over the age of 60. For self-funded retirees aged 55 and over, the supplementary bonus of $2,000 will also be provided. Importantly for pensioners and low income retirees, until they start paying tax, the tax thresholds will be $14,500 for single people or $24,500 for couples, and this is extremely significant. These are real benefits under the taxation reform system. The government is committed to protecting the living standards and the financial security of all Australians.Let us look at the record of our opponents over here. In the good old days when Labor was in government, when wholesale sales taxes were jacked up consistently, of course there were no compensation payments to pensioners or retirees. The ALP still has no plan. Where is the ALP's plan? Their only plan - aside from rolling out ex-ACTU boys club members - is a scaremongering campaign with no policy.But there is one question I would like to ask the member for Lilley: will you keep all these generous compensation payments to families and pensioners or will you support a repeal, just as you said in your newsletter:It could be repealed today. We will support a repeal. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. It is a proper question to ask, because there is a significant degree of interest among some sections of the Australian community about the possibilities of having parents join them in Australia if they have come to Australia as migrants themselves. The fact is that we do have a limited program of 500 places for aged parents and we have a considerable queue of people who seek to access those places. It is in response to that that during the consultations I had recently in relation to the migration program I took the opportunity of discussing at public meetings and in more informal meetings with particular interest groups their view about the way in which we should proceed to address this particular dilemma - and that is the dilemma of how you can bring people to Australia in their more mature years and not impose a significant financial burden upon the whole of the Australian community for their support.I spoke to many people at those public meetings, but I can remember only one occasion when somebody said they had an expectation that if their parents were allowed in they should be supported by being able to access benefits almost immediately after entering Australia. Most people said to me that if they were given the opportunity to bring their parents to Australia they would be more than happy to support them, to ensure that they did not claim benefits in Australia and to meet a reasonable cost of providing for private health insurance. - Knowing that the health costs for people over the age of 65 years are around $6,000 per year or, for an estimated life span of 20 years, $120,000 and that welfare costs for special benefits and age pensions are of the order of $160,000 over a remaining life span of 20 years - that is a total lifetime cost of $280,000 - the government has proposed a contingency reserve measure of 4,000 additional places for aged parents on the basis that there be private health insurance for a 10-year period taken out on behalf of the aged parents before their arrival or that, if they cannot arrange such health insurance, they meet an up-front health services charge of $25,000 per person. That represents about 20 per cent of the potential cost. There would also be an increased bond of $10,000 for the main applicant and $4,000 for other people, and it may be refundable after 10 years if no benefits are accessed during that time. That is not an unreasonable request and, if people were coming to Australia and disposing of property interests, very easily obtainable. The comments that came to me at public meetings -   - They were not in Liberal seats; they were in a cross-section of seats across Australia. - People said that if the opportunity was there many people would seek to access those places.I note that the opposition  seems to object to that measure, and that suggests that the comments of the member for Bowman, when I see them reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, may have some validity because he is out there saying that Labor is opposed to a scheme which would favour those with money. That is what he is saying: `We are opposed to a scheme that would favour those people with money.' He is really saying, `We are opposed to those people who have the funds to support their parents using those funds and taking their parents out of the queue for the places that are available on a fully subsidised basis.'Five hundred places would move a significant number of people off the queue, if that measure were to be supported. I suspect that is why the Australian Democrats are saying that they will seriously look at this proposal. But let me make the point that, if the opposition is saying that 20,000 parents should be allowed into Australia on the basis of those costs being fully met, in the context of the charter for budget honesty, they ought to be prepared to go out and argue that case and put it to the Australian taxpayers that their responsibility should be to support those sponsored parents where families were saying that they have no intention of asking the taxpayer to pay.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say very directly to anybody in the Australian community who was in any way offended by that document I am sorry about that, because the document was not designed to offend anybody. The document was designed in good faith by the minister and those who assisted him in preparing it to present some material and some analysis that they regarded as relevant to the debate. It was not designed with any malign intent, yet it has been unfairly represented as having a malign intent. I regard the reaction of some people to the submission as having been understandable. I include in that people who either were removed themselves or had parents who were forcibly removed under past practices. I regard their reaction as being quite understandable, and I am very sensitive to that. I regard the reaction of some who have sought to exploit this politically as being quite despicable.The truth is that there were many people forcibly removed when they should not have been. Nobody is pretending to deny that. Senator Herron is not pretending to deny it, nor am I. Nor have any of us attempted to deny that. But it is equally true that there was some elements of the report prepared by Sir Ronald Wilson that did deserve critical analysis and comment. I do not resile in any way from a rigorous examination of that report. The absence in that report of any opportunity in the report process for people who may have been involved in the removal practices to give their point of view, I think, was a regrettable and quite basic flaw in the whole procedure. References in the debate to the word `genocide' or the practice of genocide are also inaccurate and unfair.These are difficult and sensitive issues. No Prime Minister or government sets out to create a situation where people are hurt. That has never been the intention of this government. But, equally, there is a different point of view and a different perspective to be put on this issue in a number of respects, and that is what Senator Herron - a humane and decent man by any measure - has sought to bring. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he shares a desire to deal with these matters in a sensitive fashion, he would seek no further to engage in wedge politics on the subject.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its latest labour force data this morning. The unemployment rate for the month of March was 6.9 per cent. This actually is a pretty good number. It ticked up from 6.7, but when you look behind the 6.9 there are some very good figures. For example, whilst total employment grew by 8,300 in March, in fact the number of full-time jobs created, on the seasonally adjusted basis, was 27,000. That is a very strong performance and reflects the very positive news we have had in respect of employment over the last 12 months, where the number has grown by 2.9 per cent. In fact, more than 70 per cent of that employment growth over the last year has been full-time, real jobs, providing real work opportunities for people. The figure also needs to be seen against the backdrop where the participation rate ticked up on this occasion by 0.1 per cent. The figure was 63.6 per cent in March. That compares very favourably to the figure of 62.4, which was the average figure during Labor's 13 years in office. - If you want to talk about `since we have been in office', 662,200 jobs have been created since we were in office and the rate of unemployment has dropped from 8.5, which you left us, to 6.9 per cent now. Just to look at the numbers in detail, one of the particularly good numbers is the teenage full-time unemployment rate. It fell. But the figure for young people looking for full-time jobs, at 4.9 per cent, is the lowest level since 1978. Can I conclude by saying that this obviously reflects many of the changes that we have made in the management of the Australian economy, including workplace relations, the changes that have been made to getting the national budget back into order after the $10.3 billion deficit that we inherited from the now Leader of the Opposition.While we have been making those changes, which have been producing these good benefits for people - giving them the chance of a job - the Labor Party have been opposing them. They have opposed us every step of the way, while what we have been doing has in fact been providing jobs. Yesterday we saw it again. The opposition now to Australian workplace agreements just demonstrates that, when it comes to policy, if the unions want it the Labor Party say, `Anything you want.' When it comes to doing something to give young people a chance of a job, you do what the unions tell you to do. These figures demonstrate that with strong economic management in the national interest we can continue to do better, and the people who are opposed to further reform and who have opposed the reforms that have produced these good results are the members of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - It is not a question of who is right and who is wrong on something like this; it is a question of understanding the economic environment in which businesses operate in Australia. - Yes, company directors are in business. It is a question of understanding the environment in which they are operating. I notice comments from time to time from representatives of the business community and the results of surveys. Of course when you have a new tax system, a tax system which represents such a profound and beneficial change to the way the tax system of this country operates, you are going to have a great deal of interest and there is going to be a great deal of need to explain the operation of that system. It does not surprise me in the slightest, and it ought not to surprise anybody who has been in politics for a few years, that when you are embracing a change of this kind there is going to be a period in the lead-up to the change where people are going to be asking questions. People may have doubts and they may have issues to be resolved - that is a perfectly normal thing - and I find it totally unsurprising that in the months leading up to 1 July there should be surveys producing these sorts of results because it is a huge change. It is when the change comes in that the benefits will begin to flow. I would remind the person who asked the question, who has had some experience in politics both from an organisational and a parliamentary perspective, that when you have a build-up to a major change there will always be a lot of questions asked and there will also even be some doubts in people's minds. Let me say to the business community of Australia: we understand that you have questions and our response is that we are providing the answers. We are getting the administrative responses ready, but it is a huge change. I would also say to the business community of Australia and, most particularly, to the company directors of Australia, that for years and years the business community has exhorted successive governments to reform the taxation system of this country. The government that I lead is the first government since World War II that has had the courage and the commitment to reform the Australian taxation system. We were prepared to run the political gauntlet of that at the last election. We are quite prepared to endure the inevitable nitpicking and criticism that is going to go on between now and 1 July. We accept the political consequences of that and we understand that we are exposed during that period to a great deal of criticism, even doubt, but we know in the end that what we are doing is in the long-term interests of Australia. That is why we are persevering with it.You may well revel in quoting a survey of that kind and you may well derive some temporary benefit from the difficulties of preparing for the implementation of an enormous tax change of this character, but I am very confident that, as the weeks and the months roll by after 1 July this year, the Australian community will warm to the benefits of this fundamental reform and to the tax cuts; the business community will warm to a 30 cents in the dollar tax rate; the business community will warm to a halving of the capital gains tax; the self-funded retirees will warm to their benefits, particularly the abolition of provisional tax; Australian families will warm to their benefits; and the 80 per cent of taxpayers in the Australian community who will be on the top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar will also warm to the new tax system. Your sort of shallow opportunism on the issue will be revealed for the phoney response to an important national issue that it so clearly represents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. She asked whether there is any economic plan currently being promoted as an alternative to the government's program. The answer is no - most certainly, not by the opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is yet to announce an economic program, recently went up to Queensland to give a keynote address on tax. He said that he was going to assess the government's tax policy against criteria laid down by Adam Smith, which I suppose is a good principle for an ACTU president: Mr Tariff meets the invisible hand. He said that he was going to analyse our tax policy according to the principles of equity, efficiency and simplicity. He spent about two pages saying that it was not efficient, two pages showing that it was not equitable and two pages saying that it was not simple, but then ended up by saying that the Labor Party intended to keep it. They are so opposed to the GST - it is not simple, efficient or equitable - that if they ever get elected they intend to keep it. As was apparently clear from the whole of the speech, it was just another opportunistic point-scoring attack on something that the Labor Party intend, if they ever get into office, to keep. From the government's point of view, as the Prime Minister said, explaining the new tax policy involves taking on board submissions and answering questions. Part of that job is being done by the chairman of the new tax board, Mr Chris Jordan. He was on Canberra radio on 22 March 2000, taking suggestions and answering questions, when he took a talkback call from Chris from Waramanga. Chris from Waramanga rang in with a couple of questions on insurance, and the Taxation Office and the new tax system board chairman started answering these questions. Chris from Waramanga said, `The answer you are giving is contrary to evidence given in a Senate committee.' The tax office were pretty surprised by that. I know the people of Waramanga take a great interest in tax matters, but the tax office were surprised they had started reading Senate committee inquiries down there in the shopping centre of Waramanga. So the chairman of the new tax system board said to Chris from Waramanga, `If you leave a phone number, we'll get back to you with the answer.' ABC Radio 666 Canberra rang back the number, and the answer at the other end of the line was `Deputy Leader of the Opposition' - Chris from Waramanga ringing out of the office of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on talkback radio, with questions about the GST. There he was. No wonder they do not have time to produce a policy. Here they are with all of their little employees ringing around on talkback radio trying to create confusion about a tax which they intend to keep. They have no policy, no ideas and no tax suggestions - just a heap of people sitting in parliamentary offices calling on parliamentary phones trying to create trouble in the guise of Chris from Waramanga.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Robertson would well understand the nature of the Black Spot Program. While the government provided $500,000 to rectify an accident black spot on a road in your electorate, the New South Wales Labor government would not contribute, even though it was their road. They stayed right out of it. They contributed nothing to fixing the hazard, and the road is their responsibility. They walked away from it. It is not just the New South Wales state Labor government that walk away from the Black Spot Program; the federal Labor Party are just as bad. They abandoned it altogether when they were in government.We introduced this package in 1996, after Labor had abandoned it, to reduce road trauma across Australia. Since then, a total of no fewer than 1,490 programs have been funded at an estimated value of $156 million. It is worth illustrating this to demonstrate that it is of value to Australians living in electorates right across the nation. For example, in the year 2000-01 Black Spot Program, we see the electorate of Paterson benefiting.  - Ripper! Great, he says. He welcomes that announcement for a black spot program at Tamango Road and the Pacific Highway, where there were 11 casualty crashes over six years. But, if Labor were in government, it would not be fixed. The black spot would have fallen into a Labor Party black hole. In the electorate of Hunter - we had an interjection a moment ago from the member for Hunter - we have given $450,000 to fix an accident black spot on the Golden Highway where there have been six casualty crashes in one year, surely a tragedy. If the Labor Party were in government, the electorate of Hunter would have missed out too. In the electorate of Capricornia, which has really benefited from some worthwhile infrastructure expenditure by the government in recent times, we have given $50,000 to fix an accident black spot where there have been three casualty crashes in three years. If the Labor Party were in government, they would have missed out. In the electorate of McMillan, we have given $290,000 to fix a spot at Bunyip Road, Hope Street and Cemetery Lane where 13 casualty crashes occurred in five years - again, nothing would have happened if the ALP had been in power. In other words, we get rid of dangerous black spots, whereas the Labor Party just gets rid of the black spots program. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I welcome the day of action tomorrow because this government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. In four particular areas we have been able to strengthen Australia's health care system in a way that was never envisaged four years ago. First, in general practice, much of the work a general practitioner did was unfunded. It focused particularly on treating illness but not at all on preventing illness. Last year we introduced new items for case conferencing and care coordination, and new items numbers for an annual health check - the first time Medicare has focused on delivering preventative health care services rather than curative health care services. There has been a fabulous take-up of these new item numbers. They are exceedingly popular and we believe they are going to be of enormous benefit to older Australians in managing chronic illness.The second part of Medicare relates to public hospitals. The only threat that was posed to public hospitals was their chronic underfunding which resulted from the health care agreement signed in the dying days of the Keating government prior to the 1993 election. Had that health care arrangement continued, public hospitals over this five-year agreement would be $4.5 billion worse off. There is new money going into Australia's public hospitals over and above what was foreshadowed in the previous health care agreement, new money coming into the system - not money that has been taken away from the financial assistance grants to the states, as it was in 1993. We have also given the hospitals substantial additional flexibility in how to deal with some intractable problems. One simple example is in pharmacy. Honourable members would know that public hospitals were giving outpatients a script to go to a private pharmacist, or someone being discharged from hospital would have only one or two days of medicine before having to go and see a GP, which might be highly impractical for a person recovering from an operation. In the last few weeks we have signed an agreement with the states and territories whereby the Commonwealth will take over this role of providing outpatient medications and discharge medications, so there will be one level of government doing it and people will not be inconvenienced as they have been historically.When we came to government in 1996, there were two ways you could claim on Medicare: go to a Medicare office or go through the post. Today we have a network of 800 claiming facilities around Australia, including in pharmacies. And with health insurance companies being able to act as agents of Medicare there is a coverage, again, that was never envisaged.Finally, where there is a great difference between the two sides of politics is in the role of private health insurance as part of an overall Medicare system. This has been well recognised by people on the other side of politics. Graham Richardson in 1993 said, `It must always be remembered Medicare was intended to coexist with the private health insurance system, not replace it. Initial estimates of the cost of Medicare assumed that at least 40 per cent of Australians would maintain their private cover.' Bob Carr recognised it when he said in 1997, `As fast as money was hurled at hospitals, there was abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in demand on the public system.' Peter Beattie recognised it when he said, `It is an unarguable fact that if more people took out private health insurance it would alleviate the burden on the public system.' Even one Labor frontbencher recognised it in 1991 when, in a report on hospital services in Australia, the statement was made, `If private health insurance levels drop, this can result in an increased demand for public hospitals and reduced incomes from private patients.' That is the one time that the member for Jagajaga has been correct on health.In private health insurance we have tackled long-term solutions through Lifetime Health Cover and through a 30 per cent rebate. Health insurance funds lost $150 mill-ion in the first financial year that this government was in office. They are now in a healthy situation with the lowest premium increases in 15 years and the best services they have ever provided. </DOC>

 - The answer to that assertion is plainly that they are not. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have the parliament believe otherwise of a proposal that is going to reduce tax by a record amount of $12 billion - a tax change that is going to mean that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar, a tax change that will clearly leave average families far better off than they would have been.I think it is also important that, as we are looking at the proposals of the government, we also look at the proposals of the opposition. Be it remembered that this question has been asked by the deputy to the man who would increase income tax if he were to become Prime Minister. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is up here today questioning us in relation to personal tax cuts under a program that we, over the last two years, have taken to the Australian people, won their endorsement for and have been prepared persistently to argue the merits of through the parliament and within the Australian community. In relation to that program, the House ought to be reminded: the Leader of the Opposition has got himself into the impossible position of saying that he is going to roll back aspects of the GST but that he is not going to leave the states any worse off. He professes that he is no longer a serial offender so far as budget deficits are concerned and that, therefore, he is not going to put the budget back into deficit. So the only way that he can possibly achieve those goals is to increase income tax. So the real take-out of this debate is that, if you want personal tax cuts for Australian families, you support the coalition; if you want to vote for a program that will increase income tax, you vote for Kim Beazley and Simon Crean. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. I note that the opposition did not ask any questions on this matter yesterday. Obviously they have asked some questions today because it was in the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Telegraph today talks about a single income family, which it calls Mr and Mrs Black, who have two children aged six and four and who earn $50,000 a year. It says that Mr and Mrs Black have shrinking tax cuts, first of all, because of the government's deal with the Democrats which reduced tax cuts. And I make this point: yes, the government was forced to compromise in the Senate on the plan which it was elected to put into place at the last election; but no, the government did not reduce tax cuts for people earning up to $50,000. So I do not know where that proposition comes from. There was no reduction in income tax cuts for people earning up to $50,000; their income tax cuts were preserved in full. So that is wrong.The second thing that the Daily Telegraph says is that, because of the Timor tax, the Blacks lose more money. The Timor tax does not apply to people who are earning $50,000 or below. So that was a second error in the Daily Telegraph's report on so-called shrinking tax cuts. Both grounds were wrong. The claim was made that the tax cuts were shrinking. Two propositions were put forward and both of them were wrong.The third proposition that the Daily Telegraph puts forward - and I have just heard it put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - is that somehow, when you are assessing tax cuts, you have to add into the equation the effect of interest rate rises. I make the point at the beginning that these are independent  events: the interest rate cycle and tax reform. - I hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjecting again. As I said yesterday, this is the man whose sum of economic wisdom led him, alone of any of the commentators yesterday, to say that interest rate rises, which had occurred in Europe, the UK, the US and New Zealand, have been caused in Australia by one domestic factor only - GST. - As I said, these are independent events. Mr Speaker, it would be a novel prospect, would it not, if as interest rates rose income taxes had to be cut as a consequence. For example, what tax cut would have been required when the home mortgage interest rate was at 17 per cent? What kind of an income tax cut would people have then been entitled to? I did not hear the ACTU calling for income tax cuts when home mortgage interest rates went to 17 per cent. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says he did. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the President of the ACTU on 13 July 1989. He was asked, `Do you accept that interest rates have to be as high as they are now?' Mr Crean: `Well I think everyone accepts that interest rates are high because of the circumstances associated with the domestic economy growing fast.' Question: `Do they have to be at 17 per cent?' Mr Crean: `Well, they are 17 per cent.' No, no income tax cut - 17 per cent. We are talking about a home mortgage interest rate now of 7.5 per cent; leaving aside the last 12 months of this government, the lowest since 1973 - nothing like 17 per cent. The final proposition that seems to be made in these scenarios is that what you do is ignore every interest rate cut. So you ignore the fact that, when the government was elected, interest rates were at 10½ per cent and they are now at 7½ per cent - you ignore that. You ignore the $3,000 per annum benefit from the government's policy. All you do is factor into these equations interest rate rises. So you ignore that it is now 7½ when it was 10½. What you say is that you factor in a movement from 6½ to 7½.Let me tell you why such an analysis, not only because they are not related, is not done. It is only an analysis that then has to distinguish between savers and borrowers. If that analysis were right and you were factoring in interest rate rises, the consequence would be that if you are a non-home owner - that is, that you are a net saver - you would be increasing your after tax benefit as a result of interest rate rises. So, presumably, if those people were savers, you should be giving them income tax rises. If they are home buyers, presumably on that logic, you should be giving them income tax cuts.This government has put in place tax changes which reform the indirect tax system, the personal income tax system, the family allowance system and the business tax system. In relation to tax policy, as a consequence of all of that, Australian families are unequivocally better off. There has never been an occasion in Australia in the past when indirect taxes were increased and people were compensated - never in the 1980s; never during the interest rate cycle when interest rates went up to 17 per cent was there any compensation for interest rate rises. Never when wholesale sales taxes were put up from 10 to 12 and 20 to 22 and 30 to 32 per cent was there ever any compensation. Never when the petrol excise was put up by 5c and 7c in 1993 was there ever any compensation. In fact, what the Labor Party did was not only put up indirect taxes; it abolished promised income tax cuts. No, they were not even a promise - they were l-a-w, and they were abolished. Not only is the methodology of that flawed, but the cameo is wrong, as I have already illustrated. People are better off as a consequence of tax reform. This is tax reform which is going to give Australians better opportunities in the future and that is why this government is driving the changes.</DOC>

 - The claim made by the member for Lilley is probably based on a report in the Australian today. Every question those opposite ask is based on a report. The claim made by the member is wrong. I think what the member has overlooked is the change in the whole basis of family payments under the new tax system. People will get family tax benefit A or B depending on their circumstances; so, far from being worse off, people will be better off. Under the new arrangements, more people will receive assistance. More women will be eligible for the maternity allowance under the new system. You did not acknowledge that. Women on maternity leave for part of a financial year will also benefit from the increased tax free thresholds. Payments will be increased and the assets test will be abolished. Some low income families will be entitled to a family tax benefit where they do not currently receive any basic parenting payment. The family tax benefit will deliver extra assistance to single income families in recognition of the income they forgo by having a parent stay at home to raise children. Families can update their estimate of income at any time if their circumstances change.  What the opposition has overlooked and what the newspaper article overlooked is that the new tax system is an integrated package designed to deliver equitable and targeted assistance. What the member for Lilley fails to understand is that from 1 July the basic parenting payment will be replaced by the family tax benefit B and under family tax benefit B there will be no income test on the income of the primary earner. The income test will apply only to the income of the secondary earner. In overall terms, more families will benefit to a greater extent than they do at present - and the member for Lilley is wrong. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I am pleased to inform the House that the relationship between Australia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is extremely strong and growing at the moment. Of particular relevance to the member for Riverina will be the products that we are now selling to Saudi Arabia. I inform the House that there have been a number of events this year that have strengthened our relationship, particularly our trade relationship, with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Firstly, earlier this year, I led a trade mission of some 60 Australian business men and women to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That was one of the largest trade missions to leave Australia. We were very warmly received in Saudi Arabia. At that point, we had the opportunity of meeting with His Royal Highness Prince Salman, who is in the chamber with us today. Secondly, last week Australia concluded an in-principle agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on our bilateral relationship which will go a long way towards seeing Saudi's accession to the WTO. We are one of the early countries to conclude an in-principle agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on their WTO accession. Of course, the third event that is strengthening the relationship between our two countries is the visit this week by His Royal Highness Prince Salman and his delegation to Australia.On the issue of the WTO agreement, it builds upon a record export year last year where we saw $1 billion worth of Australia's manufactured goods and services exported to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Leading those exports were auto exports, and I have mentioned this before in the House. We saw around $500 million worth of automotive exports, including 23,000 Toyota Camry cars built in Australia, exported to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As part of the in-principle agreement with regard to Saudi's WTO accession, it covers almost 600 product categories, and it sees the reduction in tariffs on products such as milk, which was previously banned from the Saudi market, and wheat and wheat flour, where we have negotiated down a prohibitively high tariff. It is a good outcome for Australia. It is a good outcome for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We expect to see the relationship continue to strengthen and deepen in the years to come. After my visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and the visit led by His Royal Highness Prince Salman, we do expect to see that strengthen in the future, particularly in our trade relationship. This trade success story is obviously due to the coalition government looking beyond Labor's Asia-only policy into the very, very important regions of the Middle East.</DOC>

 - We have no intention of withdrawing the advertisement. I have not brought a ready reckoner or a calculator with me but, as always, I take on notice assertions made from the other side of the House about what has been said by anybody, be it a government, a TV advertisement, a member of the government or, indeed, a member of the community.Can I just pick up on one other aspect of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. It is this dishonestly selective use of interest rate movements - an absolutely dishonestly selective use. To start with, taxation, as the Treasurer said, moves quite independently of interest rates. - On what basis can this be irrelevant? - Returning to my theme, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have sought quite persistently during question time, with a very dishonest and selective character, to link movements in interest rates to reductions in taxation.  - Mr Speaker, I return again to the theme that I was making before the Leader of the Opposition interrupted - that is, that throughout question time today, members of the opposition have sought frequently to dishonestly and selectively -  - The opposition has sought quite dishonestly and selectively, both in the Leader of the Opposition's question and by the linking of the two - he mentions it and then he pretends he did not mention it. The reality is that since this government has been in office interest rates have come down dramatically and, even after you allow for the latest increase in interest rates, the average family is $250 a month better off than it was in March 1996 and Australian families will be dramatically better off as a result of the government's taxation reforms. No attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to falsely and selectively drag in the issue of interest rates can possibly alter the unassailable fact that Australian families will be better off.As to the particular example quoted by the Leader of the Opposition, as always, as I said at the beginning of my answer to the question, I will take that on board. I will check it, and if there is anything further that needs to be added, it will be added.  - And he doesn't want it. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for the question that he has asked of me, because this is about good news. It is about the substantial strength of the Australian economy and what is happening in our employment markets here in Australia. It is about the capacity that we have had within the program for migration, particularly the skilled program for migration, to be able to accommodate an increased number of migrants because there is an increased interest from highly skilled applicants.Earlier this week I announced a 6,000 place increase in the migration program; 5,000 of those places are in the skilled stream. It brings the skilled stream to some 52 per cent of the program numbers, and it represents the best outcome for at least a decade.Economic modelling has indicated that the combined effect of the shift in the balance of the migration program - that is, a balance in favour of skilled as against family migrants - and of the new points test has been that an improvement in living standards has been delivered. In fact, by the year 2007, there will have been, on a per capita basis, a $134 increase in GDP. Given that the program for this year has an even greater shift in the balance, it can be reasonably expected that the impact on living standards will be greater than that shown by the research.The further research that we have had carried out demonstrates that the Commonwealth budget will be highly positive in terms of its fiscal balance as a result of the net benefit of some $120 million over five years from this single change in the migration program. The new points test has been very successful in targeting migrants with skills that are in high demand, and those areas include information technology, professionals, accountants and nurses. Of course, because many of these migrants are former students, they have had the advantage of getting their qualifications here, and that is highly beneficial as well.We know from the recent data from the Australian Bureau of Census and Statistics that skilled stream entrants are doing extraordinarily well. They are making an immediate contribution to our economy. When you compare this with some of the results that we have seen overseas - particularly in the United States of America, where there has been a rise in inequality and poverty when there has been large scale unskilled migration - you can see that the changes in the program have been enormously beneficial.I might say for the benefit of the member for Batman that we are working very considerably with the states that are interested in a better dispersal of the migration outcome to obtain a significant dispersal. This is one of the reasons that we are continuing with a contingency reserve for extra places for those states and regional authorities that believe that their states and territories can benefit through further skilled migration into regional areas. This is a program that is highly beneficial to the Australian community and one which I am sure all honourable members would want to support.</DOC>

It is the same people that you said were negotiating government rebates for positron emission tomography and nothing of that is happening at all. What you are trying to do is smear someone using the old union tactic. This guy has sat on a committee for the New South Wales government on nuclear medicine and technology for five years. He has been good enough for Bob Carr; he has not been good enough for you. But that should not be surprising: the Victorian Left never takes into account what the New South Wales Right does.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. On behalf of the government and, I know, the people of Australia, I would like to offer our congratulations to Mr Yoshiro Mori, the new Prime Minister of Japan. I know that all of us will regret the circumstances in which it has become necessary for Japan's ruling LDP to choose a new leader and therefore, by operation of the Japanese political system, a new Prime Minister. I know Mr Mori, having met him during my visits to Japan. I know that all Australians concerned about our relationship with that very important country will wish Mr Obuchi, the former Prime Minister, the very best in his difficult days with his very severe illness. The relationship between Australia and Japan is a very important one. Japan for a very long period of time has been Australia's best customer, and the manner in which, starting with the trade agreement negotiated by the then Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen in 1957, the economic relationship between our two countries has been developed over the years reflects very great credit on successive leaders of both of the countries. I had the good fortune to visit Japan last year, and I look forward to meeting Mr Mori in his new capacity - I have met him in his earlier positions - at least at the APEC leaders meeting in Brunei later this year and perhaps earlier. I know that he assumes the leadership of Japan with the goodwill of many countries including Australia. It is a particularly important relationship for this country, and I know that he will contribute in a very dedicated way to the bilateral relationship, as have his two predecessors, Mr Hashimoto and Mr Obuchi. Again, I convey on behalf of the people of Australia our concern and thoughts to Mr Obuchi and to his family. </DOC>

 - The Liberal Party has a fundraising code of practice. Everything has been done completely in accordance with that. If you wish to talk about fundraising, I would suggest perhaps you check with Clyde Holding, the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, and see what financial relations flowed to the Labor Party as a result of knocking off national land rights. The Liberal Party has never plumbed the depths of the McKell Foundation. The Liberal Party has never plumbed the depths of the Hebron Foundation. The Liberal Party has never, as the former minister for health Carmen Lawrence did, refused to meet with the Australian Health Insurance Industry Association unless they organised a fundraising dinner for her, as happened in 1995. And the Liberal Party does not have relationships with private corporations where money is laundered through the federal secretariat for the personal benefit of some frontbenchers, and I think you should check a few of the people behind you, Kim. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Yesterday in his MPI speech, the Leader of the Opposition mocked and derided the sincerity of this government's commitment to the job seekers of Australia. He said that, if we were sincere, we would actually spend some money. His exact words were, `It would actually require some money.' Let us have a look at the facts about who is spending money, and who was spending money, on the job seekers of Australia. This year, the government is spending $1.3 billion on employment services, and we intend to spend the same amount in the quadrennium. In 1992 and 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment - the man who thinks the amount of money you spend is the measure of your sincerity - the spending by his government on employment services was not $3 billion or even $2 billion; it was $1.25 billion. In other words, this government is spending more on employment services when unemployment is under seven per cent than the Leader of the Opposition spent on employment services when unemployment was 11 per cent.The other thing that the Leader of the Opposition said in his MPI speech yesterday is that the government, by reminding job seekers of their obligation to accept any reasonable job offer, was playing at some sort of wedge politics. Let us look at who is really playing wedge politics.  - Who said: `We have got to go out now and intensively interview them and make them apply for work. If they don't apply for work, we will bump them off'? Who said that, Mr Speaker? It was that well-known political philanthropist Paul Keating. Who said: `What we are proposing is extra obligations on the part of those receiving the benefits to take them up'? Who said: `If they refuse a reasonable offer, they will be taken off benefits'? It was none other than that Labor lord, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham. Who said, 50 years after the launch of the welfare state: `We are ending the unconditional benefit. It is the end of something for nothing. People have got a right to expect help from the government but, in turn, they have a responsibility to help themselves'? That was not Adam Smith or Milton Friedman; it was that apostle of New Labour, the British Secretary of State for Social Security.The fact is that this government is perfectly serious in its commitment to the job seekers of Australia, and the kind of humbug and hot air that we are getting from the Leader of the Opposition shows that he is not only a leader who lacks ticker but that most pathetic creature of all - a teddy bear who never had any stuffing. </DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the Chief Minister and I met last night. I can also inform the House that the Chief Minister and I have agreed on a number of initiatives to deal with this issue, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. During our meeting last night, I indicated to the Chief Minister the Commonwealth's particular concern about the practical impact of the policy of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory on juveniles. Both of us recognised that these matters are ones normally dealt with by the criminal laws of the states and territories. We agreed, however, that our common objective - and I would think it is the common objective of all members of this House - was to prevent juveniles entering the criminal justice system.Accordingly, we agreed on a number of initiatives designed to achieve this goal. They address the particular concerns of the Commonwealth, whilst respecting the role of the Northern Territory parliament. I can inform the House that the Northern Territory legislation will be amended so that a person will be treated as an adult from the age of 18, rather than 17 years as it is at present. I also agreed that the federal Attorney-General will approach the governments of Victoria and Queensland requesting them to bring their laws in relation to juveniles into line because, at present, in both Victoria and Queensland - and it has gone unremarked - the juvenile age is designated as 17; we think it is desirable that it be 18. We will approach the two governments on this. In the end, of course, it is a matter for the parliaments of those two states as to whether they bring their laws into line, but I imagine that I would have the support of all members of the House in any approach that the Attorney-General might make.Importantly, in relation to juveniles, the Northern Territory government has agreed to amend the general orders of the Northern Territory police, so that, firstly, the police will be required to divert at the pre-charge stage all juveniles apprehended in relation to minor offences. What that means in practice is that, in respect of minor offences, there can be no mandatory sentencing of juveniles because they will be compulsorily diverted by the police to a much expanded program of diversion, including many of the things about which the member for Calare and also the Leader of the Opposition spoke only a few moments ago in this parliament. Secondly, in relation to more serious cases, there will be a discretion provided for the police to divert offenders into those same diversionary programs and, on successful completion of programs, not to pursue charges. The Chief Minister has agreed that the Chief Magistrate would continue to have special responsibility for juveniles within his jurisdiction. In addition, court lists will be scheduled so that the juvenile matters are dealt with separately, wherever possible, in a dedicated juvenile court.The additional funding that will be needed for these programs will be substantially provided by the Commonwealth. We will be making available an additional annual amount of about $5 million to the Territory. This will be provided to help fund a much enhanced diversionary program, including conferencing with victims - another matter I think mentioned by the member for Calare, perhaps also by the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, by many of my own colleagues. It will also fund greater opportunities for involvement in substance abuse and drug diversion programs. There will be additional community based diversion programs. We will also make money available, within that $5 million allocation, to fund jointly with the Northern Territory government an Aboriginal interpreter service, which will be an important element of successfully addressing this very difficult issue. It has been agreed between the two governments that the effectiveness of these new measures will be reviewed after they have been in operation for a period of 12 months. This outcome represents a practical dealing with a difficult issue. It recognises in relation to the change in the age a specific alteration to the law. In relation to the handling of matters prior to charges being laid, by the introduction of what is, in effect, mandatory diversion for minor offences, it means that juveniles apprehended for minor offences will not be caught up in the mandatory sentencing regime. I think that is an important consideration. In relation to more serious offences, there will be the option, depending on the circumstances, that that not occur. I think that represents a fair and balanced outcome. In other respects, the laws in the Northern Territory are not being altered. There are those who argue that the Commonwealth should have gone further; that is not a view that is shared on this side of the House. We think there is a role for the local parliament, the local people and the local expression of will in relation to these matters. I think running through all of this debate has been a concern about the practical impact of mandatory sentencing regimes on juveniles. There is also a concern within local communities about the need to have effective legal responses to certain forms of behaviour. I believe that these changes strike a fair balance in relation to those matters.I want to thank the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for his constructive approach to this issue and I want to thank members on both sides of the House who have shown a concerned interest in resolving what I think is a difficult issue, and one that reflects on the kind of society we are, but also one that has to take into account the fact that it is a large country and thoughts on issues like this in parts of metropolitan Sydney are not the same as thoughts on this in Darwin and Alice Springs. That is why you have a federation, that is why you have states and that is why you have territory parliaments, and I think we are very foolish if we ever lose sight of that fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. I want to make a number of points in relation to the practical steps that the government is taking to work on the issue of reconciliation with our indigenous people. The government has committed itself to this task, and the Prime Minister made a statement shortly after the last election about the efforts that we would put into working with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on developing a document of reconciliation during the course of this year. We remain committed to that task and will continue to constructively engage with the council in the hope that there can be a document of reconciliation which both sides of this House can support, and which the great bulk of the Australian community can support, because our desires and aspirations are to bring as many people on board as possible. In a practical way, we have been implementing programs which are designed to raise particularly Aboriginal health standards, and to meet their housing and education needs and boost their employment prospects. As an indication of that, something of the order of $2.2 billion has been committed to indigenous specific programs during the course of this year. We are encouraged in pursuing this course because so many of the reports and other commentary on what is necessary have pointed to the need to address the underlying disadvantage that indigenous peoples suffer in Australia.We also think it is important to provide constructive leadership in relation to these matters. Of course, it is always disappointing to us when people use terms which are designed to be divisive and designed to suggest that in some way we are lacking in a genuine commitment to be able to deal with these issues in a positive way. When you hear reference to wedge politics and dog whistles - which is a term I have heard the member for Denison use on a number of occasions - they are clearly trying to suggest that there is a lack of genuine intention on our part to work through on these issues in a positive way, but their record in relation to these matters can be something that is totally unquestioned. It is obviously of great concern to me when I hear comments of the sort that we heard over the weekend from the honourable member for Banks. The member for Banks is the one who, of course, has been making allegations about wedge politics played over the last four years. I think he suggested that in the The World Today on 3 March.  - Let's just look at where you are in relation to this matter and where your colleagues are in relation to this matter, because yesterday on the Sunday program was a superb example of those who want to play both sides of the street. - Here you have the member for Banks first saying:The position, Laurie, is that an apology costs nothing ... It can be given - and the government has legal advice to that effect - without costing the taxpayer a cent.Yet, when he is pressed on the issues later - after he makes the pleading claim that he is known for using colourful language and that this is not a time for colourful language, of course - he went on to say that in the Canadian context, when you look at the issue of apologies, they set up a reparations tribunal. He further goes on to say in relation to that matter, when he is asked whether Labor would set up a compensation fund:It's not about money, Laurie... Our policy is an alternate mechanism. You don't have to go to court ...Of course, the reporter asked:Which involves a fund? Now, how big would it have to be?Now this is not about compensation, but it clearly has to be about a fund. You cannot have it both ways. You have either got to commit yourself to compensation and spell out what you mean and what it means in a budgetary context, or you have to make it clear that what you see from an apology are words that do not cost a cent. - Of course, the Labor Party also wanted to have you believe that in relation to native title issues there are different views. I went back and looked at what happened after the United Nations -  - I went back and had a look at the statement that was issued by the member for St George and the member for Banks back in August 1999, which was headed `Howard Government's Day of Shame'. It said:This is a shameful day in Australia's history. However, in order to appease sectional interests the Howard Government has passed a law that has sullied our international reputation.They go on to say:The Labor Party will continue to pursue this issue to ensure that this stain on Australia's reputation is lifted.Clearly, what they were saying was that this legislation, in the way in which it impacted, is racist. That was the suggestion. Yesterday, the member for Banks, when pressed on those issues, made it clear that some sections were not but some sections were. - Well, you ought to listen to what your colleagues are saying on these matters. You may find it difficult to understand because there was a very clear question from the interviewer to the member for Banks. He asked:Would a Labor government move to repeal those amendments?The member for Banks said:No, Laurie. Not all ... look, Laurie ...The interview continued:REPORTER: No?MELHAM: The Labor ... Laurie ...REPORTER: No?MELHAM: Laurie ... no. Let me answer. All the amendments are not discriminatory. A lot of those amendments, in relation to the registration - you see, again, this is a side issue. REPORTER: But would you repeal?MELHAM: Our policy ...REPORTER: ... the ones that are discriminatory?MELHAM: Our policy ... REPORTER: The ones that Bill Jonas and the UN Committee ruled as discriminatory ... MELHAM: Our ...REPORTER: ... will you repeal those if you win government?MELHAM: Our policy, Laurie, is clear.The interview later continues:REPORTER: So, if you're not in favour of them, why can't you say yes, we'll repeal them?...		...		...MELHAM: Laurie, in my view, we will sit down in government, with all the stakeholders and ... we'll take advice. And, in my view, those things will be looked at. What I've done on this thing is produce proper advice ... You blokes need to come clean on these matters. You need to have a clear position. If these issues are, as you suggest, discriminatory - and we do not accept that they are - you should have the courage to take a decision and to announce what you intend to do. You should not be walking down both sides of the street by saying, `These are racist provisions but we will not commit ourselves to repealing them.'</DOC>

 - The government is committed to giving Australians a mechanism for dealing with the difficult subject of native title that is fair and effective and efficient for everybody, and the government's 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act provide such a benefit. The 1998 amendments have streamlined the processes: they allow for states and territories to develop alternative laws to deal with native title as part of their day-to-day land management practices. Last year, the National Native Title Tribunal reported on progress that has been made in streamlining those processes since the Wik amendments. The report shows how well the government's amendments are working. It makes it clear that the new processes give industry and indigenous groups a mechanism to avoid the need to go to court and to enable them to resolve issues in the spirit of cooperation. The government will continue to be committed to achieving a workable and equitable native title system.Labor left us with fundamentally flawed legislation, and it was left to this government to take the hard decisions involved in remedying those laws. Labor currently is just sitting and sniping from the sidelines. What the Australian people are entitled to know is whether the Labor Party wants to open a divisive debate on native title again. These are not new issues - the Wik amendments have been in place since July 1998 - but the Labor Party has not yet made any commitment. All it has done to date is be as hypocritical on native title as it is on the GST. The Labor Party is saying that the 1998 amendments are racially discriminatory, but it is refusing to commit to repealing those laws. It is just like the GST. On the Nine Network program yesterday, the member for Banks, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs just mentioned, was repeatedly asked whether he was going to commit to repealing laws that he regards as racially discriminatory. I have never seen anybody have so many opportunities to make a commitment and to fail on all accounts. On this issue, as on a number of others, Labor talks tough but fails to take the tough decisions. It is time the Leader of the Opposition showed some leadership and stopped deceiving the Australian public. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank you, and I thank the honourable member for the question. I have no problem with it at all. We in the National Party listen very closely to what people out on the ground say. We actually go out there and listen and talk to them and communicate. I have been to Longreach something like eight or nine times over the last 12 months. We, of course, have quite an exhaustive policy making process in the National Party as well. There will be a series of central council meetings throughout the year. There will be a series of state conferences. There will even be a federal convention of the National Party this year. All of those views will be taken into account in the National Party room, because we value the input of people who particularly have concerns about the level of services provided in rural and regional Australia, after the appalling job that you did in office. But, quite simply, in the end the party room will make decisions about the final policy position of the party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I did notice in some of the newspapers today some attention being paid to loans to the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. It is well worth reminding the House, I believe, that there has been provision in the Reserve Bank Act since 1959, when the bank was established, for the bank to provide housing loans to its staff. That provision would have been there beyond 1959, except the bank was only set up in 1959. That provision had been in the Commonwealth Bank Act, which had been the predecessor to the Reserve Bank Act prior to 1959. The practice of the bank making housing loans to its staff existed throughout all Labor governments: the Whitlam government, the Hawke Labor and the Keating Labor government. Fringe benefits tax is payable by the bank on these loans. The bank is not empowered to lend to non-executive members but can lend to executive members of the bank board, and that is disclosed in the annual report.I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition was out trying to play a bit of politics on this issue this morning, trying to work the issue up, as if he had ever been opposed to such a practice under the many Labor governments in which he actually served. For example, in 1995 when the current Leader of the Opposition was then the Minister for Finance and Bernie Fraser was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the RBA annual report indicated there were two housing loans then outstanding, aggregating $408,714, as opposed to the most recent report, which indicated that there was a loan outstanding in the order of $77,007. There was not one word of criticism from any member of the Labor Party during the period that they were in office of that practice. It is a practice which had been continued from the inception of the Reserve Bank. While the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Finance he apparently had no objection to the practice whatsoever - his comments today were more evidence of hypocritical opportunism, trying to get engaged in a particular issue over which he had no objection at all times when he had relevant influence. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the inevitable question - on which, if you note, he fudged very carefully - because the short answer to the question is that he specifically did not buy into the issue of the privatisation of Telstra. But the long answer is that this continues matters relating to the very question that you yourself asked about the party's internal procedures. That is the answer to the question. But the long answer, because I do want to make a couple of points here, is: when Ray Braithwaite left this place it was very widely acknowledged that he was - and this was recognised right across all sides of politics; it was widely acknowledged by the press gallery - a man whose integrity and decency had never been questioned in this place during the entire time that he served in public office. I find it grossly offensive that all the opposition spokesman can do in relation to this inquiry is seek to besmirch the name of decent Australians who have a capacity and a willingness to go out of their way to contribute to important national debates. The fact of the matter is Ray Braithwaite is on this inquiry because he was the member for Dawson for 20 years; he is a very experienced accountant in regional Australia; he was on the Industry Commission inquiry into the impact of national competition policy on regional Australia -  - He is of course a member of the National Party. Is that some sort of clandestine secret that has never been referred to? Is this some new revelation of shock horror that should disqualify him from making a contribution? What utter ridiculousness. It just reflects so poorly on the member for Perth that he really ought to hang his head in shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. He represents a very significant grain growing industry and I am sure, like many members on this side of the House, has been concerned about threats to the export of Australian wheat and barley to China. China is one of our most important export markets for wheat and barley, worth about $700 million a year. Two years ago the Chinese published a list of three pests and diseases which were no longer permitted to be present in any exports of wheat to China. They therefore threatened to close off Australian exports because of their concern that these pests and diseases existed in Australia. We have been negotiating with the Chinese on this matter consistently since that time, and I am very pleased to report to the House that last Friday an agreement was reached with the Chinese.The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service were able to convince the Chinese authorities, on the basis of sound science, about certain facts concerning these three particular pests and diseases. They convinced them that the fungus - which is present in Australia and, I might add, in most of the wheat growing industries of the world - is not of economic consequence in this country and is therefore not significant as a pest of wheat and barley. They were also are able to convince the Chinese, on the basis of sound science, that the striped mosaic virus had been eradicated from barley in Australia and that the nematode which had been causing them concern had never even been recorded in this country. This is an example of sound science winning the day. This follows on from the announcement I made last week about access to the Korean market for the first time for Australian fruit, an example where again science won through and was able to demonstrate that these products could be safely exported without any threat of disease or pest incursion to the importing country. This is a major breakthrough for the Australian wheat and barley industry, coming at a particularly difficult time for the industry. This is a vital market, potentially worth $700 million - or even more. We now have an advantage in exporting our cereals to China because they have accepted that Australia is free of any risk to them through our exports of these commodities. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The reality is that Telstra has some considerable way to go before it delivers satisfactory services in rural and regional Australia. We have not been backward in making that point. We have, I think, shown very considerable commitment to the only real issue in town here for rural and regional Australians - that is, securing the quality of access to and pricing of the services they need to build successful industries in the future. It is very interesting to note that those opposite spend a great deal of time defending the very thing they say they are against. They are out there every day making spurious and, I believe, unwarranted attacks on the integrity of the panel set up to do the inquiry, saying that this inquiry ought to be defended because, in their view, we have undermined its integrity by putting the wrong people in control of it - something I completely and absolutely reject.It is interesting to note that Mr Souris, in the particular interview that you highlighted, was talking about the Mudgee Hospital. The media reports about the Mudgee Hospital went out under the letterhead of an upper house member of the ALP in New South Wales. In fact a couple of weeks after it happened I rang the Mudgee Hospital looking to talk to the CEO about this and I got to speak to a senior nurse. The senior nurse said to me, `We do not know what all this fuss is about. I work in the place and I have not heard about the problem.' I do not want to make light of this - it was a problem - but it was not the crisis that it was painted to be, that Mr Souris was understandably responding to.Two lines out of 13 went down. This was reported at 10 a.m. on Monday 13 March, if my memory serves me correct, and the fault was identified that afternoon. The part was brought in and replaced on the Thursday. There is a lot of exaggeration surrounding this particular story. The question that remains unanswered but that I challenge the ALP to answer is: given that the incident became the subject of comment only after the ALP stirred it up a couple of weeks after it happened - ironically on the day that the inquiry panel met for the first time - just when did the ALP first know about this incident? The other point that needs to be made about this is that I think the hype that surrounded this event is grossly unfair to the doctors, the CEO and so forth at Mudgee Hospital who plainly, if they felt people's safety or livelihood was at risk, would have taken very concrete action indeed. So you can go overboard on these things. I just say to the honourable member who asked the question: a little balance and a reasonable approach will give us what we need out of this - that is, an accurate indication of where Telstra is performing and where it is not performing. That would be a lot more use than simply piling hype on hype. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. When the Bracks government were elected, the first thing that Steve Bracks did was appoint a former union official as his Minister for Industrial Relations. The second thing he did was confirm as his chief of staff a former ACTU official. Shortly thereafter, the Victorian government issued a ban on Australian workplace agreements in the Victorian public service. It has now come to pass that the Victorian state government also in a very deceptive way set out to bury a report which showed the benefits that were flowing to workers in the Victorian public sector at the time that they themselves moved to ban them and their availability. In 1999, an independent report was undertaken at the consent of the then Victorian government into Australian workplace agreements. When the Bracks government were elected, the report had been completed, but the Bracks government did not want the positive message about AWAs to get out, so they withdrew the permission that had previously been given to the Employment Advocate for the release of that document. - This comes from a state government. This was done independently -  - Mr Richard Curtin of Curtin Consulting has never worked for me, so it was not a fair statement. - I did not even know that bloke's name until I read it today. What is interesting is that the state government claims to be an open and transparent government, but when there are reports that are not suited to its political purpose then it works to make sure that they get buried. We will expect this week to see 100,000 AWAs approved, and they have been for many employees a vehicle for improvements in working terms and conditions. This particular report showed not only that there was no lessening of terms and conditions but that in fact there were terms and conditions available for workers under AWAs that were not otherwise available - for example, the opportunity to cash out long service leave, access to family leave provisions, access to novated leasing and access to discounted health benefits. These are benefits for workers which the Labor Party are opposed to because the unions tell them to be opposed to them. The report says:Three-quarters of responses indicated that they agreed or strongly agreed with the statements that measures to balance work and family responsibilities were included within the AWAs. This strong perception of inclusion of measures to balance work and family responsibilities within AWAs carried over into what the AWAs were seen to deliver.The report said that workers were happy with the consultation, they were happy to receive the benefits not otherwise available and they were happy with current employee relations. What did the Labor Party do? Because the unions tell them what to do, they set out to bury the report. Fortunately, this report has come to see the light of day by access through the Senate. It shows you that, if ever Kim Beazley were leader in this country, he would dance to the tune of the unions and the people who would pay the price would be the very employees that they claim to represent.</DOC>

 - Your ads will be apparent in a minute, I hope. Wendy is having a baby. After the question was asked by the member for Lilley last week, we had a little bit of an examination made of the matter and I am informed that the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. I am acting in bona fide belief that the advice that I have received is correct. The Leader of the Opposition claims that the tax package will take up to $67 a fortnight from thousands of Australian families, of which John and Wendy are a hypothetical example. I am quite happy to treat it as a live example for the purposes of this answer, Mr Speaker. In making the claim that changes to the income test for family assistance will leave many people ineligible for family tax benefit part B, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley relied on that cameo, claiming that they would be $29.06 a fortnight worse off. I am informed that John and Wendy would actually be $12.78 a fortnight better off under the changes and that, in the following financial year, John and Wendy could be up to $109.50 a fortnight better off. To further reassure Australian families -  - Oh, we are now introducing the GST. I have dealt with the erroneous proposition put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, but I say this to all Australian families - to John and Wendy, if they are listening, and to the many others who are contemplating raising families and generally taking advantage of the enhanced family benefits: one of the great features of this tax package is that it provides more options for Australian families, and that is very much what the coalition is all about. But to further reassure Australian families - as it were, to lay reassurance upon reassurance - the Family Assistance Office will establish a review mechanism to enable anybody who thinks they have been financially disadvantaged by the implementation of family tax benefit part B to have their circumstances assessed. The Leader of the Opposition's question is welcome as far as the government is concerned. I can assure John and Wendy they will not be worse off. They will in fact be better off under the measures introduced by the government. My colleague the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will be making a further statement about this matter today. I thank the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. The council of state, territory and Commonwealth education ministers, the Ministerial Council on Education, Training and Youth Affairs, met 10 days ago and took further significant decisions to provide educational benchmarks and nationally accepted standards in education in Australia. The ministers decided to extend the process of literacy benchmarking to year 7, and they also decided on numeracy benchmarks for years 3 and 5. So Australia now has the agreement of all governments to the benchmarking process, which is driving higher standards in literacy in this country and extending equity in education. Work is also progressing on benchmark standards in relation to science, mathematics and vocational education. This agenda is all about parents' right to know about, and have, objective standards against which they can compare their child's and their school's performance. This benchmarking process and this process of establishing accountability standards is right at the world forefront of educational policy, and it is lifting educational standards in this country in a way that has not happened for decades. The Howard government is marking up achievements which the Labor Party is unable to match, and the reason is that the Leader of the Opposition is too weak to stand up to the education unions. At the July conference, we read in the press, there is going to be a huge brawl over education and education policy. Sharan Burrow, who is the ventriloquist to the ventriloquist's doll on the other side of the table, dictates policy to the Labor Party and has issued her ultimatum. We read in the Australian Financial Review of Friday last week:Last night, the new ACTU president, Ms Sharan Burrow, issued a blunt statement that the Left would be seeking to exert its influence over policy direction.And I quote the comment attributed to her:We would want to see key areas like trade, industrial relations and education measure up to fundamental principles ...We know what these fundamental principles are: they are no national standards, they are no accountability, they are no reporting to parents, they are no school choice for low income parents and they are more power to the union bosses over these vital areas of government policy. The July conference of the Labor Party is shaping up to be a very big test for the Leader of the Opposition. We will see whether there is any substance at all to his rhetoric that he wants to be a supporter of education in Australia. So far, he has capitulated to the trade union movement and to Sharan Burrow on every policy. When Shazza rings, the Leader of the Opposition jumps. He knows she is the one who ultimately calls the shots for him. We will see in July whether he can pass the leadership test or whether he will continue to be, as he is widely perceived to be, a very weak and very opportunistic Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - As I always do with these things, I will take on notice the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I have them analysed, because they are never as they appear to be. I remind the House that I answered the question earlier based on the parameters put to me by the Leader of the Opposition last week. I will do exactly the same thing in relation to this, and we will come back.</DOC>

 - Last week the government announced 279 new Work for the Dole projects to provide work experience for some 5,000 young Australians around the country, including 10 who will be getting work experience in a recycled clothing shop in Goulburn, in the member for Hume's electorate. I thank him for his question. I am aware of a report in last Friday's Canberra Times claiming that Work for the Dole projects in ACT schools had stalled as a result of union opposition. The project, originally sponsored by the ACT Department of Education, was for 140 participants. Due to union opposition the ACT department now thinks that only 16 Work for the Dole places will be available. In other words, thanks to the Australian Education Union, 124 Canberrans have lost their chance to gain work experience in ACT schools and now the Australian Education Union is threatening the opportunities of the final 16.  Last year, when he was the employment spokesman, the member for Batman encouraged community groups to make the most of Work for the Dole. In the absence of any more recent statements, that obviously remains the ALP's policy - to encourage community groups to make the most of this great program. Unfortunately, the Australian Education Union hasn't got the message. I would suggest that next time the member for Dobell is talking to Sharan Burrow - if it is possible to get a word in edgeways - he should tell Ms Burrow and her hench persons to stop playing games with the young people of Australia. The parliamentary representatives of the Australian Education Union, the members for Corio and Brisbane, should similarly tell their union to stop playing games with the job seekers of Australia.When they do speak to their union, and if they are looking for a precedent to tell the union that Work for the Dole is a good thing, let me point out to the House that when the member for Hotham was the minister for employment there were at least six New Work Opportunities projects placing long-term unemployed people in schools in Melbourne as teachers' aides and as before and after school child-care assistants. In fact, under the New Work Opportunities Program there was a special category of projects to place job seekers in schools to help with numeracy and literacy. This special category was negotiated by none other than Sharan Burrow herself. So if it is all right to put New Work Opportunities participants in schools, it is certainly all right to put Work for the Dole participants in schools. This union opposition is nothing other than rank hypocrisy - in fact it is worse than this; it is a bad case of the unions punishing the unemployed of Australia on the grounds of ideological prejudice. </DOC>

 - I haven't conceded anything. What I have done is to indicate that, as with all hypothetical questions of this kind asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I will have it analysed and come back. But as to the broader question asked, it is the belief of the government that Australians will be better off as a result of our taxation package. Of equal importance, the Australian community will be better off as a result of taxation reform. The Australian community will be much better off, but individual Australians will be significantly better off. Seeing that we have been asked questions about a whole range of families by the Leader of the Opposition - not just John and Wendy, but also many other families - I just happen to have in my possession some tables prepared by Access Economics and also by Ann Harding, who is an academic, I think, at the Australian National University and someone who on occasions is quoted with great approval by the member for Jagajaga. The member for Jagajaga thinks Ann Harding is pretty good.  - I thank the member for Jagajaga. Ann Harding, for example, goes through different income ranges. After allowing a cost of living adjustment for the GST, according to Ann Harding - not according to the Treasury but according to Ann Harding - a single income couple with two children on $35,000 a year will be $61.76 a week better off. That is Ann Harding - not John Howard, not Peter Costello, not Michael Carmody, but Ann Harding - the mention of whose name brings a furious nod of approval from the member for Jagajaga. But in case anybody thinks that we are relying exclusively on Ann Harding in relation to the two income points, if we take the same family and the same income points, according to Access Economics the amounts in question are $62.28 and $59.27 a week. This is a great tax package for middle Australia. It is a great tax package for John and Wendy. It is a great tax package for the entire Australian community. I think the Australian community is increasingly looking forward to the introduction of the taxation package. I am looking forward to its introduction. I want all of those people who sit opposite to understand that every day that goes by between now and 1 July brings closer the introduction of the greatest single improvement to the Australian taxation system since World War II.  When that new scheme comes in and after people have absorbed the benefits, they will realise that for 80 per cent of them all that is going to be involved is the fact that some of the things they buy will be a little dearer.  -  - They will! But the bad news for you is that a lot of things will be a little cheaper as well, and you will be very, very, very upset about that. I know you will go in there and there you will see the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition with long faces outside the supermarket. - Yes, they will have their mates ringing into the talkbacks saying, `I went down to Woolies today,' et cetera. But the great bulk of the Australian public will find a few things go up, a few things go down and a great number of items will stay the same. Australians will be better off because they will have tax cuts. The more you try and scare people with all this negative talk, the more contempt they will have for you after 1 July, because their memory of your contribution to this debate will be that you spent two years trying to prevent them from getting something that will make them better off.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and recognise his interest in the issue of our relationship with Indonesia. Obviously members of the House are aware that, as a result of our East Timor intervention at the end of last year, there was a deterioration in our relationship with Indonesia. But in late January I went to Jakarta and I must say that I found President Wahid very cooperative and the meeting I had with him most fruitful. Since then, there have been a number of very constructive contacts between Australians and the President of Indonesia. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs went to Indonesia in late January or early February to help develop cooperation on the people smuggling issue. The President received, quite recently, the board of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. He also received the federal president of the Liberal Party, Shane Stone; former Prime Minister Bob Hawke; and the Queensland Premier, Mr Beattie. The Indonesian government have now agreed that the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum will convene this year, and I very much hope that the forum will be taking place in Adelaide. I do welcome these steps and I particularly welcome the very positive remarks President Wahid has recently made about Australia and about the importance of the bilateral relationship. Equally, I think it is worth noting a comment our Prime Minister made on 6 April in relation to President Wahid, where the Prime Minister said, `The President is the best hope we have had for a long time because he is a person of great integrity, commitment and he has achieved a lot.' I do think this is a relationship which is developing and maturing.  - I think we are now achieving the revitalisation of the relationship at about the speed we hoped to achieve it, and I think the signs for the future in this bilateral relationship are very good. In particular, we are looking forward to the visit to Australia by President Wahid, which is likely to be around the end of May, that sort of time frame. I know that that will make a very constructive contribution to the relationship. And you are welcome to ask a question, but in this millennium you have yet to ask one.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Jagajaga for her question. It invites a variety of responses and I will try and limit myself to just a few. The first one is: if what we are proposing is so bad, why aren't you going to abolish it if you win government? That is the first thing. It is an increasingly pertinent question in relation to a large number of things. Families will be very much better off under our new taxation system. We are now almost a third of the way through April - you have another two months. Somebody made the comment - I think it was a journalist - on radio the other day, and I agreed with the comment that this particular journalist made. I think it was Tim Colebatch from the Age who said that, `Really, all of this debate and everything about what the GST might be and might not be, and what it all means, gets less relevant as each day goes by because we are fast approaching - ' - Hang on, I will come to people's futures in a minute - Laurie Brereton asked me about futures. The point that Colebatch was making, which I thought was a fair point, was that the argy-bargy and the attempts at point scoring about who is going to be better or worse off becomes less relevant as each day goes by because it is coming in on 1 July. - And we have these little rhetorical flourishes from the member for Kingsford-Smith. Of course, at the present time it is easy to run a scare campaign. - The first point I simply make to the member for Jagajaga is, if what we are proposing is so bad, why are you not committed to getting rid of it? Why do you continue to walk both sides of the street on tax reform, as you try to walk both sides of the street on amendments to native title and a whole range of things? Of course the opposition can run a fear campaign between now and the introduction, and I hear people muttering things about people's futures. The future I am concerned about is the future of Australia and the Australian people. That is why I am very happy for the Australian people to remember and to make the judgment that it was a government led by me that had the courage to confront the challenge of taxation reform. Somebody else interjected about the polls. Of course, when you introduce a major reform, you take a bit of a battering in the polls. So what? In the long run, what counts is the judgment that the Australian people make about the worthwhileness of what you have done. To be perfectly honest, now that you raise the subject of polls, I am surprised that, as a result of the guerilla campaign that is being run in relation to this, the situation there is not more favourable to you lot than it is at the present time. - All of that becomes a little bit irrelevant because on 1 July this new system will come in. Instead of it being an assertion by the member for Jagajaga answered by the government, the Australian people will be able to make their own judgment. The millions of Johns and Wendys around Australia will make their purchases at the supermarket and will find that some things have gone up a little in price, some things have remained the same and some things have gone down. But the great bulk of people are going to be significantly better off. Australians all will be better off and, most importantly, they will know that they have a government that has been willing to confront the challenge, difficult though it is, of introducing long-term beneficial reform. Months after it has been introduced, they will remember with increasing contempt the negative role of the Australian Labor Party which at every turn, on every moment, on every occasion, at every opportunity, sought to destroy and drag down rather than to build up and improve. That will be the legacy of, and what will be remembered about, the Labor Party on the issue of taxation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. He will be pleased to hear that the government is progressing at putting in place an administrative scheme to support employees who have lost their entitlements as a result of employer insolvency. This is a significant extension to the safety net available to workers. In fact, for the whole 13 years that Labor was in government not one minister, not one cabinet, not one backbencher, was ever prepared to stand up and say that something ought to be done to protect workers in the situation of their company going insolvent.This government is prepared to act. We have a very fair scheme, which we are putting in place, and that will be available for workers as soon as we have completed a proper assessment of each and every one of those circumstances that has been brought to our notice. Over 190 workers have lodged applications, and no-one in the Labor Party - not one of them - is prepared to stand up and support those workers for their entitlements. Over 60 companies have gone insolvent and left employees without their entitlements, and the Labor Party is not prepared to stand up and lift a finger to help any of those employees. What is the Labor Party's alternative position? It has three different policies - two are from the backbench, and they are both from the member for Prospect. - In her press release of 12 March 2000, she advocates trust funds and does not mention insurance. In the bill that she has before the parliament, she has an insurance scheme. Back in February, the frontbench announced their policy, which was an insurance scheme based on a premium through the superannuation guarantee levy and with funding through superannuation funds. Do they have a policy? No. - The fact is that they have three policies because they have never been prepared to have a policy to support workers. Furthermore, to show you the hypocrisy of these Labor people, now we have the Queensland Premier and the New South Wales Labor Premier who are both publicly opposed to helping workers in their own jurisdictions. What response, what leadership, do we get from the Leader of the Opposition? Not one word uttered in defence of those workers who have lost their entitlements. -   - Ah, this hurts because this just demonstrates that when it comes to helping workers these people are not prepared to do a thing. The fact is that this is a classic consequence of weak leadership. Here you have two of your own. Bob Carr was prepared to put in money for blokes at National Textiles but he is not prepared to help workers up the road at Scone Meatworks. What do we expect of the leader of the Labor Party? He ought to exercise some leadership. He ought to tell Bob Carr and Peter Beattie that the Labor Party supports workers in these situations. It is a national disgrace for the Labor Party that it is not prepared to match the federal coalition on a dollar for dollar basis to help workers. I say to the backbench of the Labor Party: it is about time you put a bit of pressure on this weak, vacillating leader and did something for workers for just once in your lives. </DOC>

 - The answer to the question is yes, I can inform you that it will be included. Senator Newman announced yesterday the arrangement which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to, which takes account of any circumstance where a family thinks, albeit for very brief transitional period, that it could be worse off. In making an application under that mechanism, people will be able to take into account the impact of the GST. That is to be the arrangement, and it remains the government's belief that families will be, as we have always said, much better off under the tax reform.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Parramatta. The member for Parramatta is certainly representing the interests not only of his constituents but of the millions of Australians who are very grateful that this government has brought private health insurance in this country back to robust good health. I remind the House that in the 1996 election campaign we advocated a tax incentive for taking out private health insurance, and in the tax plan endorsed by the Australian people in 1998 we expanded that to a 30 per cent non-means tested tax rebate. Be it remembered that when this proposal was put before the Australian parliament the Labor Party fought tooth and nail to stop middle Australia getting a tax break for private health insurance. And it was passed through the parliament only due to the assistance of Senator Brian Harradine.The attitude of the Labor Party towards the private health insurance benefit has been one of fearmongering and obstruction. At no stage did they recognise that a sturdy health system in this country requires people to have an incentive to take out private health insurance. The good news is that the private health insurance rebate and the other policies of the government in relation to health are working. Thousands upon thousands of Australians are rejoining health funds or young Australians are joining health funds for the first time. The long-term benefit of this will be to take some of the strain off the public hospital sector operated by the states. The long-term benefit will be to give greater security to Australian families. The long-term benefit will be to create a better balance between public and private health provision in this country.Once again on this issue, as on the issues of native title and taxation reform, we have the Australian Labor Party trying to walk both sides of the street. When interviewed on radio 3LO on 22 February this year, the Leader of the Opposition said the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was `a complete and monumental failure'. Those people who are joining private health insurance funds in ever increasing numbers and the private health insurance funds themselves will find that an extraordinary proposition. If you look at the graph which plots what has happened to private health membership as a result of the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate and as a result of the promotion of private health cover, you will see a dramatic response from the Australian public. Far from being a monumental failure, it has been an outstanding success. It is another demonstration of the success of the government's policies. Rest assured that even though the Labor Party are against something the last thing they will ever do if they get into office is scrap it, just as the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to the GST but is going to keep it, and just as they are opposed to sections of the Native Title Act but will not undertake to repeal it. Do not ask them to have a backbone. Do not ask them to stand up for what they say they believe in. So it is with private health insurance. They are against it. They say, `It's a failure but don't worry, Australian public, we're not going to scrap it.' This is a typical example of the Labor Party walking both sides of the street, saying one thing to one audience and another thing to another audience. We have proudly supported private health insurance ever since we have been in government, and I am absolutely delighted to say to millions of Australians who have shared that faith and have shared that commitment that private health insurance is well and truly alive. It is a robust part of the Australian health provision, and that is due entirely to the coalition. At every point, the Labor Party have tried to destroy private health insurance. They ran it into the ground in government, and they tried to obstruct our efforts when they went into opposition. They ought to be condemned by the millions of Australians who warmly embrace private health insurance.</DOC>

 - Could I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that if you have the arrangement that was announced by Senator Newman and that was the subject of a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which relates to any transitional situation -  - I am sorry, that is not correct. But I will let that go by. If you have that arrangement, and that arrangement allows a person in seeking a response under that mechanism to take into account the impact of the GST, I cannot see how anybody can be a GST loser.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. The Howard government have very substantially strengthened Medicare. We have strengthened it with more funding to public hospitals, we have strengthened it by focusing on prevention and the involvement of general practitioners in multidisciplinary teams, we have more claiming points, we have more doctors in rural Australia and we have put a floor under the fallout from private health insurance. It is interesting, when we spend almost a billion dollars a year more on Medicare than we did four years ago and when we have introduced new services, that only the member for Jagajaga and the union movement can actually claim that this is somehow part of a plan to undermine Medicare.Honourable members should be aware of the alternative. All we have seen is one press release from July last year: `Macklin outlines health policy themes'. This was nine months ago. In those nine months we have not seen a single idea, proposal, plan, outline, project, proposition or any other matter of substance. The member for Jagajaga said nine months ago that she aimed to: - 	create an integrated funding structure ... - 	develop a publicly-funded coordinated care program ... - 	overcome the major inequities in our health system with programs targetted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ... - 	tackle the special needs of mental health ... - 	focus on ... early intervention ... - 	control the rising cost of medicine..., and - 	greater access to information for consumers ...She said that this would happen within 12 months. Nine months are up, and we have not seen any of this whatsoever. All we have heard is scaremongering, false propositions and a carping, negative, opportunistic approach to just about everything the government does. She criticises the 30 per cent rebate, she criticises Lifetime Health Cover and she even manages to criticise $4.5 billion of extra expenditure in states and territories for public hospitals. She criticises our commitment to Medicare. Last Friday, as part of the so-called `day of action', the member for Jagajaga spoke at a rally at the Civic Medicare office in Canberra. Unfortunately for her, a staff member of one of my colleagues happened to be walking past at the time. I was informed that the entire rally consisted of half-a-dozen Labor staffers and the five political demonstrators who turned up. The member for Jagajaga should not confuse the children waiting in the queue for the jumping castle over the road with part of the rally. The rally was a complete flop and shows that, no matter how much the member for Jagajaga tries to misrepresent and how much she tries to scare people, she cannot get any enthusiasm. All she can do is have the trade union movement circulate a trashy circular to members that somehow shows there is a growing resentment and a conspiracy to undermine Medicare.The fact is that this government is the best friend Medicare ever had. Quite frankly, the only threat to Medicare is the Labor Party's ideologically driven hatred of the mixed private-public system. The government is on about giving the public a choice between two strong systems. Medicare is complemented by the private health system. Some 81 per cent of Australians support that proposition. Labor has never been able to say that it supports both systems, and it never will.</DOC>

 - I have indicated that people who feel they are disadvantaged can make submissions. They can take into account the impact, and there will be a further statement -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should not get too excited, because he will find that, when further details of these arrangements are announced by Senator Newman, the excitement that he talks about will be very ill-founded.The proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition - and I think originally by the member for Lilley - derives from the impact in a transitional way of the substitution of a point in time income test with an annual income test. The government will have these arrangements to ensure that people who believe they may be disadvantaged for a short period of time can ask to have taken into account the impact of the GST. As a result, the statements the Treasurer and I have made about people not being worse off as a result of the new tax arrangements will turn out to be absolutely correct.  It is a strange notion even in theory that, even if a person were worse off for a brief period of time but were better off for the rest of their life, that person is made worse off by a change. It is a very odd theory indeed, and I think most Australians would see it as odd. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question and for his interest in this matter. As members of the House will know, under the government's new tax system the government is cutting $1.9 billion out of excises which are collected in this country. For any person in business, because business gets the full amount of GST back, the cost of petrol or diesel should fall by around 10 per cent. That includes farmers and small business people - anybody who has a car that they use as part of their business. In addition to that, the government is rebating through grants the cost of diesel for large trucks and for medium sized trucks which are travelling outside the metropolitan regions. That will reduce the excise on that diesel from about 44c a litre to 24c a litre. What a great benefit for people in rural and regional Australia in their transport costs! Today I can announce a third prong which is designed to help consumers, particularly consumers in regional and remote Australia. Today I announce for the first time that, in addition to reducing excise before the application of GST, the government will be introducing a grants system which will pay grants to retailers of petrol or diesel at a tiered rate, depending on whether they are in regional or remote areas, to ensure that the retailer is put in a position to pass on in full all of the benefits to the consumer. So for people in regional or remote Australia, as a result of tax change, their fuel costs need not rise and regional and remote Australia will be protected in full under the new taxation system. This will be a direct benefit to regional and remote Australia of around $500 million over a four-year period. So, if you are in business in regional and remote Australia, the costs of your petrol or diesel will fall by 10 per cent; if you are in regional or remote Australia, the cost of transport will fall from 44c a litre on your diesel to 24c a litre; and if you happen to be a consumer in regional or remote Australia a grants system will ensure that no petrol price to the consumer need rise, with another $500 million of benefit over a four-year period to regional and remote Australia.I want to pay tribute to those members of the coalition backbench who have made representations to the government on this matter. Of course, we know the Labor Party policy is to keep GST, but it never came up with a scheme in relation to this or in relation to anything else. I want to make this other point, and that is that the diesel rebate, which brings the cost of diesel on large trucks down from 44c to 24c, could have been made a benefit to all trucks in Australia if it had not been for Labor Party opposition. It was Labor Party opposition which meant that this government had to compromise with the Australian Democrats. There were people in metropolitan Australia who were cut out of the benefit because the Labor Party, which is so opposed to GST that it intends to keep it if it is ever elected, voted up in the Senate against benefits for people in outer suburbs and in metropolitan Australia.Paul Kelly said in the Australian that a political party campaigning against a tax it wants to keep was political fraud on a grand scale. It is political fraud on a grand scale masterminded by economic pygmies over there - the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - who are so opposed to the GST they just cannot wait to get elected and to take advantage of it. It is political fraud on a grand scale under two of the weakest leaders of an opposition ever. We are going to have an MPI debate later on and we will have all of these complaints about the GST from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But listen carefully to his speech: will you hear one policy? Government members - No.  - Will you hear one proposal? Government members - No.  - Will you hear one idea? No, no, no. It will be a speech on how terrible the GST is and, therefore, that is why the Labor Party intend to keep it. That is their position - complete fraud.</DOC>

 - The answer to that is no. I have already indicated that Senator Newman will be making further information available about this as we get closer to the day. But nothing that the opposition says - either the member for Jagajaga or the Leader of the Opposition - can in any way gainsay the fact that families, both generally and particularly, will be massive beneficiaries under this arrangement. They will be massive beneficiaries.  - The Treasurer has just announced an arrangement in relation to the taxation reform that will be of enormous benefit to individuals and families in rural Australia. The government's taxation reform will proportionately advantage families in a quite marked and dramatic way. Any suggestion that it is designed - as implied in the member's question - in some way to disadvantage women is of course absurd. I would remind the parliament that one of the distinguishing black marks of the Labor Party's apology for a taxation policy at the 1998 election was the application of penal rates of marginal tax on working women. One of the reasons why that policy of tax credits was so resoundingly rejected by many sections of middle Australia at the last election was that working women saw through it and saw that for extra effort they went into higher marginal tax rates. The point I would make to working women in Australia is that under our tax plan - and the member for Jagajaga gave me the opportunity and reminded me of this when she asked her question when she talked about the wage structures applying to women in the Australian community -  - Under our tax plan, every person who earns up to $50,000 a year, men and women, will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Here she is -  - interjecting in her normally engaging fashion. She is interjecting and saying that they are under a certain level. Here we are and 80 per cent of all Australian taxpayers are earning under $50,000 a year -  - Under $50,000, 80 per cent: by your question and your interjection, that obviously includes in your view a very large number of women in the work force. They will be massively better off as a result of this. They are going to be hugely better off as a result of the introduction of this system. I think that is a cause of very positive response from the women of Australia.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Hughes for her question. The coalition government is about putting consumers first. We have done that in relation to the transition to the new tax system by giving the ACCC additional powers and resources to deal particularly with price exploitation by businesses during the transition period to the GST.Today I can inform the House that the ACCC has issued its first GST price exploitation notice, on Video Ezy Australasia. After intensive investigations, the ACCC has formed the view that Video Ezy has been exploiting consumers by charging an extra 15 per cent for video rentals and blaming the 10 per cent GST for that impact. Individual executives of Video Ezy may face fines of up to half a million dollars. The Video Ezy company may face a fine of up to $10 million. This is a strong warning to business: if you try to rip off consumers during the transition to the new GST system, you will pay a very heavy price. Whilst not all Video Ezy stores have been engaging in a rip-off of consumers, consumers themselves should be aware that they have the power to alert the ACCC to price exploitation. I can advise the House of that because, whilst the Labor Party members for Chisholm and Lalor have been asleep at the wheel, it was in fact their constituents that advised the ACCC of the rip-off by Video Ezy. Out of the suburbs of Hawthorn and Altona in Victoria, the consumers advised the ACCC of what was happening in relation to the GST. - The Labor Party can wax and wane all they like, but what they should be aware of is that the member for Hughes asked me about alternative policies in relation to consumer protection and the ACCC. In fact, there are lots of alternative policies coming out of the Labor Party. On the one hand, during the debate recently in the House, the member for Hunter and shadow minister for small business viewed extended misleading conduct powers for the ACCC as `having horrendous implications for Australia's small firms'. He added that `it is not good for small business to pass this bill'. Then the member for Hunter went and voted for the bill. On the other hand, the member for Hotham came into the House and wailed about the importance of consumer protection with the GST, and then he sent the misleading conduct bill off to a Senate committee to delay its implementation to protect Australian consumers. When it comes to ACCC resources, we have the Labor Party Minister for Fair Trading in Queensland saying that the ACCC does not have enough resources to protect consumers from rip-offs, and the Labor Party minister for fair trading in Victoria writing to the ACCC asking it to allocate resources to help out the Victorian government. So, out of all of that, the Labor Party's policy on consumer protection is confused and contradictory, and the policy of the coalition government is clear: we are putting Australian consumers first.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I am pleased to announce to the House that last night the number of Australian business numbers issued passed the one million mark. In fact, there have been 1,012,187 Australian business numbers issued to business and other entities. The number of applications for an Australian business number has also been rising strongly, and the total number of applications received as at today's date is 1,272,534.  - I hear the honourable member for Kingston interject. The last job in his distinguished career was working for the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, who, together with the then Leader of the Opposition, brought down a budget $10.3 billion in deficit which they said was a surplus. Only $10,300 million out. Missed it by that much - $10,300 million. - A great qualification for getting yourself onto the Labor Party backbench - $10,300 million out. - Never trust the Labor Party with money, Mr Speaker, never trust them with money. I also point out that the number of registrations, which has now passed the one million mark, indicates that the applications are kicking up, and I would encourage businesses to lodge their applications as a matter of urgency. The tax office does not guarantee a business an Australian business number for 1 July, unless the application is in by the end of May - 31 May. If the application is not in by 31 May and the business does not have its number on 1 July, it will not be in a position to claim input tax credits. The business may also find that, because it does not have a number, other businesses dealing with it are withholding as a consequence.One of the great things about a goods and services tax or value added tax is that it becomes a self-policing mechanism. People who do not have a number have a withholding applied to them. This means that businesses have an incentive to go into the system and, as a consequence, the government has the ability to crack down on the black economy. That is one of the reasons why the goods and services tax will be good for honest taxpayers - because forcing businesses to register with an Australian business number on pain of not getting their credits back or having withholding means that businesses come into the system. As a consequence, tax is collected at the point of consumption and, as a consequence, decent, honest taxpayers get a tax break - and that is what we stand for on this side of the House.I can also say that, notwithstanding the Labor Party's efforts to try to sabotage the new tax system as much as it can, we can report that registrations are going well. I point out to some of the great thinkers of the Labor Party frontbench that, of course, they are committed to the GST. As a consequence, on 1 July, when the clock goes past midnight and Labor comes out on 1 July and says that it is in favour of the GST, the Labor Party will want to have as many businesses as possible in the GST system - because you are committed to making up every last dollar out of the GST to the states and the fewer the number of registered businesses and the lower the GST collections, the higher you will have to drive income taxes to make up the money to the states.The Labor Party, if it were ever to be elected, would need to get as much as possible out of GST because any shortfall is to be made up by Labor hiking income taxes. It has guaranteed the full revenue. So, as a consequence of that -  - the Labor Party has an interest -  - in ensuring that the scheme actually works. - The Labor Party would be well advised to cease its efforts to sabotage the new tax system and to join in a system which it would hope to take advantage of, if ever it got into government, and to make sure that it works.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his real interest in this matter. I think it would be fair to say that many will indeed be interested in what I am about to outline. The Aboriginal employment strategy at Moree, which, as the member referred to in his question, is now being picked up by the community at Bourke, is, in my view, a quite outstanding example of what might be called practical reconciliation. It is a truly positive example of a community which, for all of its wealth - and the Moree community is recognised as the most productive agricultural shire in Australia - was riven by racial division and, at times, violence and other problems, but is now increasingly putting that behind it as it works to bridge the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous people.This strategy has been very strongly supported by Minister Reith, through his department, and the total grant now is some $422,000 from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The AES - the Aboriginal employment strategy - currently has around 85 indigenous employees placed in work in the Moree district, of whom about 65 or 70 are now full time. It began in the cotton industry. It has now spread to related industries - farm services industries and what have you - and into town as well where Woolworths has around 15 indigenous employees supported by the strategy.I well remember a few years ago when the originators of the scheme, Dick Eston and Alice Scott, who are irrigators, and Warren Barnes from the indigenous community, came to see me at the Moree Plains Shire Council office. Since then, they have developed a highly effective strategy team, and that team works with local employers to create jobs on the one hand and to place Aboriginals into advertised employment on the other. They work very hard with Aboriginal employees, mentoring them as they adjust to what might be loosely termed a normal life - some even having to put criminal pasts behind them. Both employees and employers are encouraged to put everything on the table and to properly respect and work with their cultural differences.I am told that some of the young people employed through the program are now doing apprenticeships. Perhaps most encouragingly of all I am told that in the last 12 months in the local high schools Aboriginal students are now talking about career paths and long-term goals for their lives. That has not been the case in the past, and I think it is a very encouraging outcome. I understand too that almost all of the people on the books are in unsubsidised employment and that a growing number of Aboriginal people in the Moree district have gone through this program and today are part of the mainstream work force. I think that is a very good thing. Dick Eston said to me today on the phone that it can be done. It requires commitment, openness, a willingness to put everything on the table and leadership at the local level. Imposed solutions from on high or from outside do not work.The strategy team continues to move on, and I have been told today that, in an attempt to resolve more of the social difficulties that still need to be tackled and which perhaps hold back some of those involved in the program, that team is now seeking the involvement of the Moree ministers' fraternal to build further family and community support for the program. To their great credit, the strategy team is now seeking to encourage other towns, including the city of Dubbo - also in the member for Parkes's electorate - to implement similar strategies.In closing, the greatest symbol of the enormous change here is that the town has now designed and is waiting to launch a new flag. The flag features Aboriginal artwork and a slogan - and for anyone who knows Moree, this says it all - `Moree, leading the way on reconciliation', and underneath that, in the language of the Kamilaroi people, it says, `Welcome.'</DOC>

 - I have indicated that, closer to the introduction, the minister will be making an announcement about the details of how this operates. - The minister will be making a further statement about how this will operate, but I would remind the House -  - The families to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred will be significantly better off as a result of the changes that we have proposed. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga and the Manager of Opposition Business seem to believe that if you provide a mechanism whereby people who believe that they may for a period of time be disadvantaged by something have a right to put their case -  - that, in some way, represents an admission that people will not be better off, which is an absolutely absurd proposition. People will be infinitely better off to the tune of $12 billion in personal tax cuts; 80 per cent of people will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar; and there will be $2½ billion of family benefits. I think overall, as I said in the House yesterday, that when the new arrangements come into operation the Australian public will treat with contempt, and remember with contempt, the behaviour of the Labor Party that, at every point, tried to obstruct the introduction of this new plan which will be of enormous benefit to Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. The Australian workplace agreement was one of the reforms that the government introduced in its legislation which went through the parliament in 1996. Australian workplace agreements have been an important addition to the options available to employers and employees. The number of Australian workplace agreements is an important indication of their success. I should say, however, that the mere availability of these options has been of real assistance in some key industries - to mention two: the meat processing business and the coal industry. They are both important industries for Australia, and the mere availability of this option has been a factor in encouraging changes and improvements to workplace practices.I am delighted to inform the House that today the number of approvals of Australian workplace agreements has now passed 100,000 - testament to the success of these agreements and their usefulness for employees. These Australian workplace agreements have a number of features, which I have pointed to in this chamber this week. One of these is that they have been a very successful instrument for giving people the chance to better balance their work and family responsibilities.Sadly, the Labor Party, for ideological reasons, is completely and totally opposed to Australian workplace agreements. It is opposed to them because the unions insist that every agreement that is entered into should either be with a union or allow a union to have a veto, even though in the private sector today less than 20 per cent of workers are in a union. The Labor Party, as usual, is responding to the pressures of the unions and its frontbench. With more than half of its frontbench former trade union officials, including two former ACTU presidents, it is committed to the abolition of workplace agreements, even though that would be against the interests of workers.Employer associations have made it clear what they want. The ACCI made the point by urging the ALP not to take a backward step on Australian workplace agreements. The AIG, representing the manufacturing industries, say that Labor's policy would be a retrograde step and, furthermore, went on to say that it would be far preferable for the Labor Party to declare its opposition to industry pattern bargaining and the Victorian unions campaign 2000. The Australian Mines and Metals Association, reflecting the usefulness of these AWAs in that industry, said, `The important role of individual agreements in the economy should be recognised and enhanced.' I want to congratulate the Office of the Employment Advocate for helping over 100,000 employees to enter into arrangements which suit both them and their business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The National Youth Roundtable is meeting in Parliament House today and tomorrow. The roundtable, as members will know, is the government's principal youth advisory body. The 50 members of the roundtable were selected from some 1,000 high calibre applications from right across the country. They represent every state and territory and every age between 15 and 24. They come from a diverse range of cultural and community backgrounds. They represent all levels of education, work and study in that age group. There is an even split between male and female members. There are five indigenous young people, young people who had been unemployed, parents, disabled young people and young business people. It is a remarkable cross-section of young Australia today. The roundtable will spend the next two days meeting with senior government ministers, working on their recommendations to the government to distill the issues that they want to bring to the attention of the government on behalf of young people. The roundtable shows the commitment of the government to listening to young Australians. All members of this House have been advised of the roundtable members from their electorates, and many from both sides of the chamber have already made contact with their local members of the roundtable. I was very pleased to see present at lunch today, with the members of the roundtable, members from the other side of the chamber as well as from this side of the chamber. The roundtable is a non-partisan body. The government has had no knowledge of the memberships or otherwise of members of the Youth Roundtable when they were selected. They are a representative cross-section. They come from every part of Australia. This is an area where I would expect the Labor Party, for once, to be non-partisan; and I am pleased to acknowledge the fact that there are members on the other side of the House who have adopted an appropriate non-partisan position and have talked with members of the roundtable in a quite appropriate way.I want to express my disappointment with the attitude of Senator Lundy, who has taken an exceedingly partisan position in relation to the roundtable. The only person damaged by that is Senator Lundy, because it creates an impression in the minds of members of the roundtable that, even when the government puts forward a completely non-partisan initiative, the Labor Party is unable to act in a non-partisan way. I hope that Senator Lundy is an isolated example. As far as I know, Senator Lundy is an isolated case because her behaviour is not reflected in the behaviour of other members of the Labor Party or of the Democrats who have attended roundtable functions. I invite all members of the House who have received invitations to attend the presentations by the roundtable and to attend the functions that are being held between now and tomorrow evening.When the roundtable was opened this morning, it was concluded by Daniel Hyden, a roundtable member, who summed up the tremendous camaraderie, the team spirit, the passion and commitment of these young people. He said:The National Youth Roundtable has empowered us with a magnificent tool for representing young people of Australia to those of you here today who make the policies and lead this great country of ours. This tool is impressive, probably the most impressive I have ever seen ... this tool is each other.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina. As she outlined in her question, her electorate does indeed have the Kapooka army base, which is the home of soldiers as well as having a very important Royal Australian Air Force base. As we approach the 85th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli, there are only two original Gallipoli veterans left in Australia today. They are Mr Alec Campbell, who lives in Hobart, and Mr Roy Longmore of Melbourne. I am pleased to inform the House that this morning I accompanied the Prime Minister to the Australian War Memorial where Alec Campbell - who I believe we are very lucky to have with us in Canberra today, because his health allows him to be with us; Mr Roy Longmore was not able to travel here because of ill health - symbolically passed the Anzac legend into the hands of a new generation. At that ceremony this morning Mr Campbell presented an Australian flag to six young service men and women representing the three arms of the Australian Defence Force. These young Australians are some of the finest members of the Australian Defence Force. I would like to refer to them, because I know that they are with us in the Speakers Gallery today. Sublieutenant Rupert Guthrie joined the Royal Australian Navy in March last year and is currently at HMAS Creswell. Seaman Pamela Eadie graduated last year as a combat systems operator and was `recruit of her intake'. She is currently posted to the Anzac frigate HMAS Arunta. Lieutenant Glenn Mathews joined the Army in 1991 and was part of the Special Air Service Regiment until 1994. Last year he graduated from the Royal Military College where he received the Sword of Honour for outstanding military achievement. Private David Bower was awarded the Skill at Arms prize as the most outstanding student on his recruit course and is noted for leadership. He has just returned from active duty in East Timor.Flight Lieutenant Richard Rahdon joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an undergraduate medical student, and last year was awarded the Royal Australian Air Force Officer Qualities Award. Aircraft Woman Trina Tonkin joined the Royal Australian Air Force last year and was awarded the 1999 Academic Dux and Personal Qualities Award. Her great-grandfather saw service on the Gallipoli Peninsula and was awarded the Military Medal. I am sure her great-grandfather would be very proud that she will be representing - along with the other five - the young face of the Australian Defence Force today.They will take an Australian flag to Gallipoli where it will be flown on Anzac Day at the first dawn service to be held at the new commemorative site on the Gallipoli Peninsula which has been developed by our government and also the government of New Zealand with a tremendous amount of support from the people of Turkey and governments at both a local and state level in Turkey. The new site is to be opened by our Prime Minister, together with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and the Leader of the Opposition has been asked to represent the opposition at that service.Mr Speaker, the new site has been made necessary because of the increasing numbers of young people wanting to attend the dawn service at Gallipoli. It is no longer possible to hold it where it has been held for a number of years at the Ari Burnu War Cemetery because of the damage the numbers could potentially do to that cemetery. A lot of research has gone into the choosing of the new site which in fact is called the Sphinx site. It is in fact a site named by the Anzacs themselves. If you read the history of the first landing, you will notice that the 3rd Field Ambulance arrived at North Beach, just where this new site is, and included in the 3rd Field Ambulance on that early dawn landing was John Simpson Kirkpatrick. So in many ways it is a very historic site and one that I think is going to continue to be able to cater for the increasing numbers of young Australians and New Zealanders wanting to make the pilgrimage to that site.We in government - and all of us - have a duty before us to ensure that the Anzac legend never dies and we must make sure that forever this possession, which was given to each of us by people like Alec Campbell and Roy Longmore, never dies and that the younger generations of Australians take that legend with them throughout this new century. I know that these six members of the ADF will be representing the young people and new generations of Australians in this new millennium. I am sure you will agree that this gives us the confidence to say that the Anzac legend will never die while it is in the hands of the younger generations of Australians. </DOC>

I did note a report in today's Canberra Times with great interest because it contained the seed of a hint of a glimmer of a suggestion of policy on the part of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Dickson urged Canberrans to reject Work for the Dole in ACT schools because she said they had `no prospect of employment after the program and no training'. Instead, she said that we should have something like Labor's New Work Opportunities program which was, she said, `a proper labour market program which put people in real jobs with real training'.In declaring that Work for the Dole should be boycotted by community groups, and in declaring that it should be replaced by something like New Work Opportunities, the member for Dickson was completely contradicting the former employment spokesman, the member for Batman, who encouraged community groups to participate in Work for the Dole. She completely contradicted the Leader of the Opposition who said of New Work Opportunities type programs:It's true that out of a lot of our training programs people didn't get a job at the end of it, but they weren't around on the streets bothering everybody else.She has contradicted the member for Melbourne who said of New Work Opportunities type programs that they `led to perverse outcomes with some unemployed people forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training'. - The problem in the Labor Party is that the left hand does not know what the centre left hand is doing. The fact is that well over 30 per cent of Work for the Dole participants are in employment three months after finishing the program, compared with just over 20 per cent of New Work Opportunities participants who are in employment. Work for the Dole costs about $6,000 per successful employment outcome; New Work Opportunities cost over $50,000 for successful employment outcomes. So the member for Dickson wants to put in place a policy which costs more and produces less. On the subject of Work for the Dole in schools, dozens of school principals around the country who have experienced Work for the Dole endorse this. Typical of the comments is this one from a Victorian school principal, who says:I feel the program provides a service to both the individual and the school.I have got here a letter from Kylie Browne, who was a participant in Work for the Dole in a Victorian school, and she said:Almost immediately I loved it. I had found my calling. I know that sounds silly but I truly loved it. I had been concentrating on hospitality type jobs and never gave teaching a second thought until work for the dole.I now work part-time in the school where I did my work for the dole experience and I have my confidence back which I had started to lose being unemployed for such a long period of time.This is a great program. These are fine projects. It is utter hypocrisy of the unions and the Labor Party to support New Work Opportunities in schools but reject Work for the Dole in schools. The unions and the Labor Party should stop punishing the job seekers of Australia because of their own old-fashioned, ideological prejudices.</DOC>

 - There has been no weakening of our commitment. But this gives me the opportunity - and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; I am indebted to the opposition for allowing me to talk for a few moments, particularly to those on this side of the House who represent the interests of rural and regional Australia and to the many rural and regional people throughout the nation - to state that we have delivered in full on that commitment we made in ANTS. We are proud of the fact that, as a result of the arrangements announced by the Treasurer yesterday, the price of petrol, as indicated in the tax reform documents, need not rise as a result of the GST. That means that, as a result of the introduction of the new taxation system, there will not be any increases in the price of petrol. But it gets better: as a result of the introduction of the new taxation system, the tax component of the purchase of petrol will now be deductible for taxation purposes. As a result, the price of petrol used in any business anywhere in Australia will on average be about 7c a litre cheaper than would otherwise be the case. But it gets even better than that: today the Assistant Treasurer released what might loosely be called in the trade the `diesel maps'. These spell out those areas of Australia that will get the full rebate; the rebate originally promised by the government which would have been available to everybody but for the failure of the Labor Party to support small business in the metropolitan areas of Australia. This failure of theirs will be another reminder to the small business community of Australia, as we come through 1 July and the months after 1 July. For those people who say, `Why isn't this rebate available everywhere?' I will be able to answer, `Because the Labor Party didn't want it to be available everywhere.' The Labor Party were very happy to obstruct, to confuse, to deny and, generally, to behave in a very uncooperative fashion. The diesel maps fulfil the commitment we made to rural and regional Australia. It would have been fulfilled for the rest of the community but for the failure of the Labor Party to recognise their responsibilities to urban people. They decided to abandon the businesses of urban Australia in the interests of playing politics. If I can return to the issue of petrol, the good news out of the Treasurer's announcement - and indeed it was all good news; all the Treasurer's announcements are good news for the Australian economy - is that the promise we made will be delivered in full: petrol will not rise as a result of the GST.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. I think people who look at the government's tax reform policy could say, independently and objectively, that the great winners under it are rural and regional Australians. Not only are income taxes cut, with the largest tax cut in Australian history, but company taxes are cut from 36 to 30 per cent; the capital gains tax is halved; if you happen to be in business, it is effectively a 75 per cent discount for businesses in respect of their roll over into a new business; and if you happen to be a farmer who has held an asset for 15 years and you are retiring at the age of 55 to go into the town, you can sell something capital gains tax free, which has never been done before in Australian history. There is $1.9 billion of cuts in diesel and petrol excise. In addition, the program which I announced yesterday is a targeted grants scheme to regional and remote Australia to ensure that, as a result of tax reform, petrol prices need not rise. That has been very warmly received overnight. The National Farmers Federation said:The initiative will be particularly welcomed by Australians living in rural and remote regions.The President of the Queensland National Farmers Federation said:Yes, this is great news, not only for farmers but for anyone who is living in rural or regional Australia.The Australian Automobile Association welcomed the announcement. The NRMA welcomed the announcement. The RACQ representative said the grants scheme is the only sensible way to ensure prices would not rise after the GST. The MTAA welcomed the government's decision. The Australian Democrats welcomed the government's decision. As far as I could tell, I found only one group of people in Australia opposing the system. There is a group of people in Australia who are apparently opposing the government's grants system for rural and remote Australia. I regret to say they are led by none other than the old ex-ACTU President himself, the member for Hotham.I got a good laugh this morning when I was reading today's Bulletin. There was an interview with the Leader of the Opposition. The report says that the Leader of the Opposition, when asked about how Labor will win the bush:. . . says - with a straight face - that Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson are popular in rural Australia . . .`We're from the ACTU and we're here to help you; here we are, sign 'em up, roll 'em up, unionise those farmers, help them' - all these ex-ACTU presidents out there in rural Australia helping the farmers of this country. Good heavens! There he was out on radio today, opposing this grants scheme, and Howard Sattler said to him, `I made the point to one of your colleagues yesterday it would be better to have an all or nothing GST and not a mish-mash;' Simon Crean, `There's an element of truth in that' - an all or nothing GST! But hang on, the Labor Party is in favour of roll-back - `roll-back', Mr Speaker, the policy which now dare not speak its name. You will never hear `roll-back' coming from the Leader of the Opposition because `roll-back' on income tax means `roll up'; on spending, it means `roll out the barrel'; on unions, it means `roll over'; and in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, it means no policy, no integrity and no principle. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. The federal government is slashing transport costs for rural and regional Australia for the benefit of the entire nation. This is in direct contrast with the ALP which when in government only ever increased fuel excise, often and arbitrarily, and in opposition has sought to do nothing other than to block the very real relief that we are offering. I note in passing at the outset that primary producers, of course, will be eligible for this regardless of location. The Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant is a vital part of the federal government's commitment to cut fuel costs. It provides relief for on-road diesel usage, thus complementing the expanded Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. It starts very shortly now, on 1 July. It will provide grants for use of diesel and certain alternative fuels, with particular focus on transport activities in rural and regional areas. The application of this grant on top of the input tax credits for business will lower the effective diesel excise to around 20c a litre - a saving of 24c a litre, which takes the level of excise back to those of about 1988. That is a very long time indeed. In fact, since metrication in the early 1970s I do not believe that any government has cut fuel excise - let alone absolutely slashed it - in the way that this government is doing from 1 July.As I mentioned, primary producers will be eligible for this grant, regardless of location, in recognition of the fact that several primary producers who operate on the urban fringe may otherwise have been excluded from eligibility for the grant. Grants under the scheme will be available to contractors or agents who transport goods on behalf of a primary producer, providing that that producer is the sole beneficiary of a journey. Vehicles between 4½ tonnes and 20 tonnes can qualify for journeys in rural and regional areas. The government has now released the metropolitan boundaries for the scheme. I note at the outset that no less than 99 per cent of the Australian land mass is excluded by the rural and regional boundaries. I also note that those boundaries were not part of the government's original tax reform package. It was only Labor's blanket opposition to tax reform that made the compromise package necessary. It is worth remembering that their form on fuel excise is pretty good - 500 per cent increase in excise during the time they were in power. The discretionary rises were extraordinary: 3c in 1986, 3c in 1993, 1c in 1994, 1c in 1995 - all of it, of course, without any compensatory mechanisms at all. Under Labor, excise on diesel consistently rose; as I mentioned a moment ago, we are the only people who have cut it. The endorsement and support for this today has been overwhelming. From the Queensland Farmers Federation:The government has listened; members ought to be congratulated for their approach.From the Australian Trucking Association's Andrew Higginson:This is a win-win situation for industry and Australia.But who wanted it not to be a win-win for Australia? From the National Farmers Federation, `Fuel scheme changes will benefit country.' The VFF `welcomes on-road diesel breakthrough'. A New South Wales statement is headed, `A major win for farmers on diesel tax reform as commonsense prevails.' It is a commonsense reform. It strikes me that we live in a strange sort of age. According to the ALP, the GST is so bad that they will retain it. The health rebate arrangements are so bad that they will be retained. We are not sure about what they will do about native title because they have done a flip-flop overnight. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has let the cat out of the bag that the fuel tax cuts that we are putting in place are so good that Labor are going to get rid of them. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey, who represents one of the most vastly populated parts of Australia where fuel tax is a major issue, for his question today. This question and the government's announcement in relation to the fuel grants scheme really represents a major watershed in the difference between the politics of this side of the parliament and the politics of the opposition, the difference in the approach to life in regional Australia between the coalition and the ALP. Of course we should not be surprised because the ALP have plenty of form when it comes to dealing with fuel tax issues. When in government, the only direction they ever sent fuel excise was up. It went up from 9c a litre in 1983 to 33c a litre in 1996. That is how much they wanted to encourage agriculture. That is how much they wanted to encourage people who lived in rural and regional Australia. They wanted to tax them and tax them ever more. Indeed, at one election they actually had the audacity to go to the Australian people promising tax cuts and then within days had delivered a massive increase in fuel tax. Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel, it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside of the capital cities. It is a tax on farming in the distant parts of our nation. It is a tax on living and setting up a business in a country town. That is the sort of tax that Labor wants to increase. But what a contrast today. As the honourable member for Grey rightly points out, the announcement by the government today is perhaps the most significant cut in farm costs announced by a government in Australian history. Reducing their transport costs in getting their produce to the market makes Australian farmers more competitive with people who are farming in other parts of the world. It gives us an opportunity to get off the back of Australian farmers some of this huge transport cost that is associated with moving their product to the marketplace and then into export opportunities around the world. It makes our farmers much more competitive.What a difference there is between the approach of this government and the approach of Labor. Labor considers cuts in fuel excise to be a subsidy on pollution. So it is pretty obvious where it stands on these sorts of issues. If the Australian farmers and rural communities were unfortunate enough to ever again have to endure a Labor government, the first thing they could be assured of is that the tax rebate scheme announced today, this grants scheme which offers such enormous benefits to rural and regional Australia, would be abolished. It would be lost. The fuel tax would be back up to the 30s, 40s, who knows, that the Labor Party has been infamous for in years gone by. It is not surprising that the farm organisations have been so enthusiastic about this policy. It is great news for rural and regional Australia. It is not just good news for farmers; it is good news for their rural communities. It is good news for those who do business in country towns. It reduces not only their costs but also their cost of living because the cost of bringing things to country towns will be so much reduced. The other thing I would like to mention briefly is the fact that these benefits apply also to farmers who live close to the cities - egg producers or horticulturalists who live close to town. They will not be disadvantaged under the arrangements announced today. So all Australian farmers will benefit from this significant initiative. The government deserves the congratulations that are coming to it from farm organisations because this is a major breakthrough in the costs for rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I think I have to give the honourable member for the Northern Territory a similar answer. I will take a huge risk: I will accept his depiction of what the price of petrol is in the nominated place as being an accurate depiction.  - No? Do you think that is risky, do you?  - I cannot simultaneously be in Paterson, the Northern Territory and Parramatta. This is an able government. It is a very dexterous government. It has a great amount of talent. It is a government that is willing to travel. But I cannot be in all of those places at once. I simply invite the member for the Northern Territory, along with the member for Paterson and the member for Hunter and also another member who asked me a question - I forget who it was; it was an unremarkable question - to come back after 1 July and they will have their answers.  - Actually it will be a Saturday when the GST is introduced.   - Oh, we know the date! I invite you all to come along and you will be well and truly instructed. Let me conclude this answer with this thought: the government made a very deliberate commitment in relation to the cost of petrol and the impact of the introduction of the GST. We made that commitment knowing full well the implications of that. I want to congratulate the Treasurer on the scheme that he announced yesterday. It was a very good scheme and it is a scheme that will deliver that commitment. For those on the other side who seek this information, no doubt instructed by the interests of their constituents, I ask only one thing. When it is revealed, as it will be, that that commitment has been delivered in full, I ask that you transmit that valuable information to your constituents. </DOC>

 - The honourable member for Moore is aware that Telstra operates in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry. All Australians would be aware by simply looking at the billboards that are available on any freeway and by looking at television advertisements that appear every night that the price of telecommunications has dropped significantly in recent years. In fact, the price of an untimed local call is now down to around 15c per call. - The price of STD is down by something like 45 per cent. The price of international calls has gone down in the last couple of years by some 80 per cent. And, yes, the honourable Leader of the Opposition has got it right: that comes from competition. Less than three years ago when competition came into place on 1 July 1997 there were three telecommunications carriers. Today there are 39 licensed telecommunications carriers in this country. A couple of years ago Telstra was competing for big business in the context of some 60 companies who sought a tender from two telecommunications companies. Today, some 1,000 large companies seek telecommunications companies - this time seven telecommunications companies - to in fact tender for the work that those companies require. The government recognised some considerable time ago that if you want to get the level of services, the diversity of services, available to all Australians you have to unshackle Telstra and get it away from government ownership. We went very clearly to the Australian people in the October 1998 election and in a satisfactory way we got the endorsement of the Australian people to sell the rest of Telstra. In that regard, there is a clear understanding by the Australian people of just what is required in respect of this company and what the government will do. We will continue to ensure that the regulations are there to deliver those services. We welcome today's announcement - a clear delivery on the guarantee given by Dr Switkowski a short time ago of upgrading services in regional Australia, a $350 million customer access network upgrade on top of the $700 million announced by Telstra for regional Australia on only 8 March this year. We welcome that and, under the regulatory regime that this government put in place, we will continue to ensure that there will in fact be service levels that are there. We said when we went to the Australian people that there was one condition: an independent inquiry. That inquiry is under way in respect of the adequacy of service levels that are there. So the Australian people have absolutely no doubt that it is in the best interests of Australia and the best interests of the community to see Telstra out there, unshackled, competing in that highly competitive world and not owned by government.What is the opposite view? I note with great interest that tonight the Leader of the Opposition will be addressing the Sydney Institute, and he will explain through the Sydney Institute why there should be no further sale of Telstra, as I understand it. It is going to make for some interesting listening and reading. An article in today's Bulletin entitled `The Accidental Leader' has this comment: He is against the sale of Telstra but he didn't really used to be and many in his inner circle are convinced he would sell it if in office.There is a book available, if anybody wants to produce it, of his quotes on the benefits of privatisation when he was the Minister for Finance and responsible for all of those sales like Telstra, like Qantas and like the Commonwealth Bank. Of course, now we know he has a different view because he is in opposition. It will be interesting to see if there is a bit of roll-back in the speech tonight with respect to Telstra - roll-back seems to be his latest theme for everything. The one thing I know I can guarantee is that whether he makes a speech on Telstra tonight or whether he makes a statement in this House today the take-out will be that Labor is totally lacking in leadership. There is nothing there in the way of direction with respect to Telstra and the benefits that are there for the Australian community in anything the Leader of the Opposition may wish to speak upon on that subject - whether it be now, tonight or, I suspect, next week.</DOC>

 - The government do not believe in giving special privileges to minority groups. The reason we are not in favour of giving special priority to minority groups is that inevitably a large number of people miss out. For example, when the ACTU and the former Labor government were running the economy, low income people actually suffered a decline in their real wages from the start to the finish of about five per cent. As the ACTU has said, one of the proudest boasts of Australia in the last four years is that those very same people have had an increase in real terms of about eight per cent as a result of the policies introduced by this government. So we are not in favour of special deals for their mates, particularly as we have seen special deals for their mates when Labor has been in.Labor have always been prepared to hand over power to their union mates, so students in New South Wales suffer in their educational opportunities because the Labor Party have given the education system to the unions. In Victoria, investors and the business community lose out and, in the end, jobs are lost because the unions have enjoyed special privileges, special powers, under the Bracks government to get very good deals for themselves. Now we find that the Victorian government are seriously contemplating setting up a whole new industrial relations system just so they can give their union mates jobs in the new system - at a cost of $24 million plus. When we go from the state scene - whether it is Mr Beattie or Mr Bracks - to the federal scene, exactly the same thing is happening. So we find the whole of the frontbench of the Labor Party stacked with former trade union officials, including two former ACTU officials. The Leader of the Opposition defends his party rules which give unelected union officials control over the party platform.  - Even last Friday he went down to the ALP executive and asked them to endorse a policy which was in fact drafted by the very same people running the executive - none other than the principal trade unions. The weakness of this leader is demonstrated by the words of my predecessor, Gary Johns, who was a minister for industrial relations. And what does he say? Well, he has blown the whistle on you big time. He says:Local branch members have no say in preselection. There is no sense of democracy in Western Australia. It has the most overwhelmingly union dominated preselection rules. Branch members are irrelevant. It is whatever the main union characters at the time think. Kim has been the major beneficiary, so he won't try to change anything. - Mr Speaker, in the British Labour Party they had exactly the same problem and they decided, with Tony Blair, that they would adopt a mainstream policy, and Tony Blair had a lot of fights with the unions to adopt that. When Gough Whitlam was the leader of the Labor Party he said, `First we've got to reform the party. Then we go to the policies, and then we go to the people.' A weak leader rolls over in the face of the demands of the trade union movement, and in the end as a result ordinary working people miss out. The fact of the matter is this: if it is tax policy, they roll over; if it is income tax policy, they are putting it up; and with the unions, they roll over again. The reality is that it is not in the public interest and in the end it is the ordinary people who suffer.</DOC>

I can inform the House without checking that, if the amount of superannuation is above the tax-free threshold, the person in question will get a tax reduction, and you do not have to wait 12 months to get the tax reduction. In fact, you get it from 1 July. If the person is eligible for a savings bonus in any form, that person will also be entitled to claim that savings bonus. As for the adjustment of the superannuation, of course I do not carry those details with me. I will check and I will inform the member.

 - I thank the member for Barker. When we were elected there were 3,200 different federal awards. I am pleased to advise the House that, under award simplification, there are now only 1,800 awards and 425 of those have been simplified. This is real progress. - This is an area where the Labor Party said that this is something that should be done. Paul Keating was always telling international audiences that we ought to have award simplification, but, of course, it never happened under Labor because in the end they were not prepared to implement a policy which would provide benefits to the system. They say one thing to various international conferences, and they say another thing to the unions because the unions run the show.Here in the ACT the clerks award is another example where benefits are now available to workers as a result of the government's policy, which Labor knew they should introduce but did not because the unions would not allow them. When this particular award came up for simplification it was realised that for ten years the workers had been missing out on minimum rate adjustments. In other words, the union was failing to do its basic job and, because Labor was not prepared to get on with simplification, the workers were missing out. I am very pleased to advise the House that, as a result of award simplification introduced by this government, this award has been before the commission and, with a new classification structure in place, minimum rate increases have been up to $100 per week; a significant improvement in the safety net for workers - something that Labor knew should be done but never did, because the unions would not allow it.To conclude, in Workforce this week there is a very good headline, `Award simplification helps ASU win $100 rise.' The fact of the matter is that this was the government's award simplification process in action. Not only did Labor not follow through with what they said was a good idea, but when they were in opposition they voted against the very measures which have seen wage improvements in terms of the safety net for workers. This was another classic case of the unions being comatose on the job - to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition. It is one of his favourite words. No wonder you use it, mate - half the backbench is comatose. It is your favourite word. You obviously have not read this article, and I table `The accidental leader'. I suggest the backbench read it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I know of his interest in quality training opportunities for the members of his electorate. This government has given top priority to providing expanded quality training opportunities for young people. The number of young people aged 15 to 24 in training as of 31 December last year was 182,300. That is 45,000 more than when the Labor Party left office. Young people comprise about 68 per cent of all new apprentices. We have increased greatly through our policies the number of places in TAFE. Over the four-year period an additional 160,000 places have been provided in TAFE for Australians seeking training. The number of young people in vocational education in schools has rocketed up from about 26,000 in 1995 to 136,700 this year.The policies of the Howard government are providing greatly expanded opportunities for the 70 per cent of young people who do not go straight from school to university. There are no alternative policies on the record. The Labor Party has no alternative policies in this area. It exhibits complete policy lethargy under the Leader of the Opposition. This policy lethargy is not new. Policy lethargy is the style of the Leader of the Opposition. When he was the Minister for Education and Training, the former Prime Minister Paul Keating had to step in and take over the policy area, take over control of training policy, because nothing was happening in that area. As Helen Trinca of the Australian reminded us on 24 June 1992:He has been unable to control the training agenda .... His failure to run hard on TAFE and training and kids and jobs has allowed the erosion of his position.It was during that term of the Leader of the Opposition that we had youth unemployment at record levels at 34 per cent. We lost 20,000 apprenticeships in one year. The Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no interest in young Australians. He has no interest in providing more opportunities for young Australians. When Paul Keating stepped in and organised a youth unemployment summit, what was the contribution of Kim Beazley? The contribution of the Leader of the Opposition was to say that he thought young people had nothing to contribute to such a summit. He said he did not believe youth representation at the summit would be particularly helpful. Despite being the cabinet minister with portfolio responsibility for the issue, Mr Beazley said he did not think it was necessary for young people to be represented at the summit: `having young people around telling us that is not necessarily going to be a big help'.The Leader of the Opposition has got a long way to go in re-establishing his credibility with young people. We would like to see a much more positive response to the National Youth Roundtable than we have seen from you so far. The Leader of the Opposition has been pathetic in the education portfolio. The Prime Minister at the time ran over him in the Finance portfolio. The only portfolio he ever wanted to be in was Defence, and of course in that portfolio his main claim to fame was that he signed the contract for the Collins class submarine.</DOC>

 - Let me say that for all of the years when the ACCC was actually setting the price you had that differential. This is not a new thing. I do not think you could say it was caused by that. In fact, the ACCC price has actually locked in differentials. If you will recall, that was the whole idea of the monitoring. The ACCC did an inquiry into the petrol industry. Do not hold me to the precise number, but I think it was the 28th inquiry into the petrol industry -  - I stand corrected - the 40th inquiry into the petrol industry in Australia over 20 years. What it found was that the country-city price differential is a factor of several things, one of which is the transport costs, obviously, out to the country.  - I do not know if you are supporting the government's tax reform package, but under that of course diesel excise falls 44c, to 20c, which is bringing down the cost of transporting petrol. - I think your constituents actually would be looking forward to you supporting the government's tax policy and reducing the diesel excise. If you like we will go back through your voting record to inform your constituents whether or not you did. The second thing that the ACCC found was that there was a difference as a result of volumes. Obviously if you have smaller volumes then you have got to have a larger price differential. If you have larger volumes you can have a smaller differential. The ACCC in its 40th inquiry recommended that the government do a couple of things - first of all, that it get the oil companies to agree to offer a standard price to people who brought tankers to the gate, and that the price be open and transparent. The government actually got the oil companies to agree to that. Secondly, the ACCC said that we should abolish the Laidley agreement. You would recall the Laidley agreement, which was forced as a result of TWU blackmail action in the 1970s to keep independents out of the industry. The best way of abolishing the Laidley agreement is under the government's 45D and 45E legislation, again something the Labor Party opposes - and we look forward to your support in keeping secondary boycott provisions in place.The third thing the ACCC in its 40th inquiry recommended was that there be restructuring at the retail end, so that at the retail end you could get petrol stations with larger volumes and would therefore have to have lower margins. The other thing that it recommended was that we open up competition for new entrants. In particular, it said one of the benefits coming from new entrants would be if you got people like Woolworths into the industry that gave new competitive impetuses, and it noted that where Woolworths had come in it had actually taken prices down, but there was resistance on planning grounds from many country councils. One of the things that would be worthwhile supporting would be supporting, with country councils, changes to planning so that you would get new entrants into the retail level. The government got the agreement of all of that as part of also implementing a new oil industry code, which had been negotiated with the Motor Trades Association to protect the independent retailers.I want to say that there have been some people in this parliament who have worked on petrol and really come to grips with it and understood it. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the member for Indi, who has probably done more work on this than anybody and who made sure that these recommendations of the ACCC were followed up. So the government was able to get to transparent pricing. The government was able to get transport reductions. The government was able to get measures in place against the Laidley agreement, and the government is pushing hard to open up entrance for new people. Where the government came to grief was in the deregulation at the retail end. When the recommendation of the ACCC was put to the Australian Senate to actually deregulate at the retail end so that margins could drop, it was opposed by a political party which was more interested in keeping up differential rates for rural and regional people than in acting on that recommendation and bringing the differential down. I say, without naming that political party, it was a totally opportunistic position that they took. They were not prepared to look after consumers. It was cheapjack opportunism in the Senate that led to that outcome. I give this undertaking to the independent member: if ever there is some leader in that political party and it forsakes cheapjack opportunism we will bring those measures back and we will be able to do something for people in country Australia. </DOC>

 - I certainly can confirm to the House that all states agreed at the meeting of agriculture ministers in Melbourne last month to proceed to deregulate the dairy industry in their states. It is important to point out to the House that dairy deregulation is entirely a matter for the states. There is no legislation required of this federal parliament to deregulate the dairy industry. It is entirely a matter and a decision for the states. But the Commonwealth was concerned about the impact on dairy farmers, their loss of income as a result of deregulation, and so put forward a very significant adjustment package to support dairy farmers through these difficult times. - The package will relieve some of the pain that is going to be associated with that restructuring package. - The honourable member for Hinkler asked whether any of the states, in spite of the fact that they are all proceeding with deregulation, had actually volunteered to put up any of their money to support their dairy farmers. I am pleased to report to the House that the Western Australian coalition government have announced that they will be providing $37 million by way of compensation to dairy farmers in that state. The Western Australian farmers will have the benefit of not only the Commonwealth adjustment package but now also assistance from their state government. Unfortunately, none of the Labor state governments have been prepared to follow suit. Perhaps it is time the dairy farmers in Queensland and New South Wales asked their state governments why they cannot follow the lead of the Western Australian government and do something to provide support. - I was very interested to hear that in the state parliament in Queensland yesterday Henry Palaszczuk,the state Minister for Primary Industries, informed the parliament that their state had decided, reluctantly, to accept the Commonwealth's offer of $220 million in restructuring support for dairy farmers in that state; they are `reluctantly' accepting that money. He went on to wax lyrically that this is the largest restructuring package ever put together for any industry in Australia and that the average amount of money the dairy farmers in Queensland will receive from the dairy industry package is $135,000. So he is very enthusiastic about this package, and he is `reluctantly' going to accept it. It seems to me that perhaps the Queensland Labor Party have developed the Federal Labor Party disease of being against everything but reluctantly accepting it: `We're against the GST, but we'll keep it. We're against private health, but we'll keep it. We're against tax reform, but we'll keep it.'  - `We're against dairy reform as well -  - but we'll gladly take the money. We'll do it.' - What is more, they are not prepared to do anything to support the dairy farmers of their own state when the regulations are removed. Once again, Labor are reluctant players in the field but happy to take the money and happy to take the benefits that this government is offering through its restructuring proposals.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his continuing interest and representations on behalf of his constituents on this issue. I also thank the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister and their cabinet colleagues for the announcements they have made on fuel in country areas. The forestry industry is very transport intensive, and the jobs that are at risk in many relationships of the new arrangements will be better protected if transport costs can be reduced. It is interesting that even the Queensland government will no doubt be reluctantly pleased to know that fuel costs and transport costs are falling. Within the agreement referred to, they have so messed up the distribution of resource that they are now having to use Queensland taxpayers' money to pay transport subsidies to be able to deliver sawlogs to some of the mills to which they guaranteed that product.At the time that the Commonwealth government was negotiating a regional forest agreement with the Queensland government, certain factors were known. At the time of the National Forest Policy Statement, the then Premier Wayne Goss suggested and agreed with the Commonwealth government that a $10 million plus $10 million package would be sufficient to deal with the problems that might arise. I put this in the context of the Premier running around his own state saying that, through acts of some of the federal backbenchers on this side of the House, Queensland has lost $36 million. That is a total untruth; his government only ever requested a $10 million assistance package from the Commonwealth. All of a sudden and for reasons that are not known to me, the Queensland government abandoned all the science, all the professional advice of their own department and of the Commonwealth experts, and decided to do a backroom deal. They succeeded in that by dividing up the spoils but not based on any scientific fact. They signed an agreement with some parties - the Wilderness Society, the Queensland Conservation Council, the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society and the Chairman of the Queensland Timber Board - to put together an agreement that they said was made in heaven. That particular agreement had as its objectives a commitment to conservation, sustainable forest management, an efficient timber industry and economic development creating employment prospects for rural communities. Let us take that in reverse order and talk about employment opportunities. The agreement bought out the firm of Boral and gave them a reputed $14 million. Boral took Queensland taxpayers' money straight down to Tasmania, where there is a parliament and a government that are supportive of forestry jobs, and they invested Queenslanders' money in Tasmania. In the process 100 sawmill jobs went out the window. They are defunct. We were told not to worry about that, and the state government then listed a number of jobs that would replace them. Funnily enough, 241 of them had nothing to do with the hardwood industry; they involved the pine industry. The reality is that those jobs were unrelated. We then find that a series of other jobs that were referred to were similarly unrelated. The employment situation - Opposition member - Sit down. - Isn't it amazing that people start to say `Sit down' when you argue the case for jobs for workers and yet those people are of the L-A-B-O-R Party? - Every time I raise the issue of jobs, start to give the statistics and explain how the Labor Party and all the backbenchers on that side never, ever contact me to protect the jobs of the people in their electorates, they start to squeal. It is a pity that they do not stop squealing and actually do something about it. They have a friend in me. I actually want to help their people keep jobs.Rather than detain the House much longer, I want to touch briefly on the conservation issues. When scientists were working in Queensland, they told us that 338,000 hectares was the limit of the available productive forest and that you could get about 80,000 cubic metres of timber out of it. In fact, in its agreement the Queensland government closed down 425,000 hectares of forest, much of which was of higher productivity, but it is still guaranteeing the same amount of wood. The simple arithmetic says that either it is not there or it will have to deal with the forest in a very brutal fashion. Another part of the agreement says that no clear-felling is to be practised, yet at this moment to meet those contracts the government is clear-felling. What is more, the state minister, Minister Welford, has admitted to me personally that that is what it will do. The agreement fails on jobs and on conservation, and it will have to be rectified by a future government.</DOC>

 - There are so many inaccuracies and false assertions that it is hard to know where to start. I would just say that matters of departmental process are being looked at by the Auditor-General, and presumably he will have something to comment on that. In terms of the volume of questions that come through from the Senate, if you examine the numbers, my department actually gets more than just about any other department. We try to comply, but the Senate gets unhappy when the answers are not actually bundled and come through in dribs and drabs. Finally, I do not concede at all, and have never conceded, that there was a leak of any information. In 15 months, you have not produced any information. - It is interesting that the member for Kingsford-Smith should talk about villainy when we have the example of the McKell Foundation. Someone should ask who pays for his overseas trips.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. You can get support from strange quarters, but I was very pleased to get support from the former Labor Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, who yesterday morning said that our strategy to make younger Australians take out health insurance was working, which it is. In relation to private health insurance and public hospitals, he said: I think if we can take a bit of pressure off that it would be terrific. It is something we must do. I have also been receiving letters from honourable members containing concerns from their constituents that the 30 per cent rebate might not continue. I can give honourable members an absolute assurance that this government has every intention of continuing the 30 per cent rebate indefinitely because of its great success. I can assure the member for Charlton, for example, who writes to me and says that two of her constituents are concerned that the government is planning to remove the private health insurance rebate, that I will be referring them to the speech in the House where she described the rebate that her constituents want as `an absolute disgrace'. The only threat is if she is re-elected.Similarly, the member for Newcastle has written to me with a letter from two of his constituents, Albert and Norma, in Jesmond who are worried. They say: We are most concerned about the fate of the 30 per cent rebate. Leave our rebate alone. I will write to them as well and say that there is no threat provided the government stays in government. The fact is that the Labor Party has been negative and opportunistic on this the whole way. With 29 press releases from the shadow minister for health, every one of them has been critical of this most successful rebate. In the morning press I noticed that, in response to Medibank Private's very successful new membership enrolments that are happening three months out from the cut-off date from lifetime heath insurance, all the shadow minister can say is that we are running a scare campaign to force people into private health insurance. The only people that should be scared are the 35,000 people in her electorate who have private health insurance and will be worse off if the ideological Left ever gets control of the health agenda.  </DOC>

 - I see that the member for Hotham gets worked up about measures that he has not even seen yet. I would suggest that he look carefully at legislation which is being introduced this afternoon which introduces the measures that were recommended by the Ralph report in relation to the alienation of personal services income. It implements recommendations of the Ralph report in relation to alienation of personal services income, and the measure raises as a consequence $1.4 billion over four years - nothing like the ignorant and ill-informed material he put to the House earlier on today.The reason why this government is introducing measures on the alienation of personal services income is that in 13 years of government the Labor Party never moved in this area once. The member for Hotham would have people believe that the Labor Party is interested in this issue. After 13 years of government, the Australian Labor Party had done nothing. The most they had got to was in the famous 1995 budget when Mr Willis promised he would put out a discussion paper on the issue. He never put out a bill. He never introduced legislation. He never committed the Labor Party to doing anything. This is the government that had to pick up the unfinished business - because the lazy Labor Party did nothing over 13 years - and put it into legislation and bring it to this parliament. This is the party that has had the courage to do the hard work when Labor did nothing, and the ill-informed ranting and raving from the member for Hotham - who stands condemned for absolute inaction - will not change that position one iota. </DOC>

 - Yesterday there was made probably one of the most disgraceful attacks on a public officer in this country that has ever been made in this House. Yesterday the shadow Assistant Treasurer stood up in this House and insinuated that the Commissioner of Taxation may have delayed a criminal investigation to secure a reap-pointment. It was one of the most disgusting allegations that has ever been made in this parliament, and it was made in this parliament for one reason, that he wanted to abuse the privilege of this place and take protection against a gross libel of the Commissioner of Taxation.If the Leader of the Opposition had any courage at all he would publicly reprimand the shadow Assistant Treasurer. The Commissioner of Taxation yesterday released a statement saying that he took great exception to this suggestion, outlining that throughout the criminal investigation he sought the cooperation of the Australian Federal Police, and said that, in accordance with advice from the Australian Federal Police, ministers were notified when warrants were executed. The insinuation that was put forward yesterday by the shadow Assistant Treasurer was, frankly, a disgusting slur on the Commissioner of Taxation.If this were a leader of the opposition who had any courage at all he would discipline the shadow Assistant Treasurer. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition of what he said on 31 March 2000. He was asked by a journalist whether the Labor Party was part of a conspiracy to damage the ATO. He said this on 31 March 2000:That particular allegation is completely untrue. We, of course, don't have that sort of influence, and if we had that sort of influence, it would never be directed against the public servants.He said:We in politics don't turn - not on our side of the House - don't turn our attention on the bureaucrats.That is what you said on 31 March 2000, whilst on that side of the House the shadow Assistant Treasurer got up yesterday and turned his attention on the bureaucrats and, under privilege in this place, made a disgusting insinuation about the Commissioner of Taxation. If you had any leadership at all you would stand by your comments on 31 March. You would pull him into line. You would tell him to retract, or you would sack him.</DOC>

 - The measures which the government is putting in place are implementing the measures which were recommended by Mr Ralph, and they are measures which are being put in place in the Income Tax Act for the first time. - And the reason this legislation is being introduced this afternoon by this government, the reason it is the first government in Australian history to do this, is that for 13 years the Australian Labor Party did nothing. Let the Australian Labor Party point to one piece of legislation on the issue. -  - This government came to office when the Labor Party after 13 years said it would publish a discussion paper. It never did. This government had a recommendation from Mr Ralph, and this government is going to legislate that. - The -  - What John Ralph recommended was that people who rendered services in an employee like manner should be paying marginal income tax rates. What this government will be delivering is legislation that provides for people who are employees or delivering employee services to pay personal income tax rates. And what this government will also be delivering - as was recommended by Mr Ralph - is that those people who are genuine, independent contractors in a personal service business will be able to go into the business taxation system, as Mr Ralph recommended. This will be the only government that has ever introduced legislation on this issue, and it fell to this government because of 13 years of Labor Party nothingness.They can run around and cast slurs on the Commissioner of Taxation, but if this man had any courage at all he would be pulling the shadow Assistant Treasurer into line today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Medical work force issues have been a very difficult and intransigent problem over decades but we have had very substantial success in work force issues relating to general practice because of the provider number legislation that was passed by this parliament and came into effect on 1 November 1996.This legislation was recently reviewed by Ron Phillips, a former health minister of New South Wales, who found that the legislation had been particularly effective in two areas. In having a look at the government's success in getting more doctors into rural Australia, Mr Phillips said data received from a number of organisations indicated there had been an increase in the number of doctors in rural areas. While not ascribing it solely to this legislation, he went on to say that the likely reason was that it was the result of a package of reforms of which the provider number legislation `is a fundamental element'. The second thing that Mr Phillips found that this legislation had been successful in doing was addressing bottlenecks in work force supply. In his words, `exceptions to the legislation, for example, the rural locum relief program, have ensured that particular work force supply bottlenecks have been addressed'. When this legislation was passed a sunset clause was placed in it. It was placed in the legislation because of concerns at the time put quite hysterically by young doctors and vested medical interests. The claim at the time was that 400 doctors a year would be out of work as a result of this legislation. Well, by now we would have 1,600 doctors unable to gain a training place because of this legislation. The parliament put a sunset clause in so that we could be sure that no young doctor would be disadvantaged. Mr Phillips looked specifically at this area and made the following point:... an attempt was made throughout the review to identify a single junior doctor who had missed out on a training place. Despite continued anecdotal assurances that such people did exist the review was unable to identify any such individuals.Here we have a piece of legislation that has been single-handedly responsible for the rural locum replacement program and a fundamental element in getting more doctors into rural areas. You can understand my surprise that when this sunset clause came up for appeal yesterday into the parliament the Labor Party voted against it. The net result of voting against the sunset clause is that the rural locum replacement program will die. The direct result of voting against this sunset clause is that up to 150 doctors in rural Australia, who are there today because of exemptions to this legislation, will no longer have their practice restricted to areas of need.To give the honourable member for Dawson some idea of the success of the rural locum replacement program, in the electorate of Capricornia, for example, in the December quarter of 1999 alone - in one quarter - 37 doctors went in and provided locum relief for local doctors. Somewhere closer to town, in the electorate of McMillan in Victoria 10 doctors in the December quarter alone went in to provide locum relief. Locum relief is actually very important, as even the opposition understands. On radio station 2CR Central West the shadow minister, in an interview with James Gruber on 30 March, in saying what was important to get doctors into rural areas, said:It is these other issues about getting a locum. It is so they can continue to get their medical education or just have a day off.The opposition here is prepared to destroy the one thing that has got locum doctors into rural Australia, a fundamental issue in helping us get more doctors into the country, all for expediency. Ron Phillips put it very well when talking about the effect of this legislation on young doctors. He said:There is no doubt the sunset clause has been used as an effective weapon to create a climate of fear for medical graduates. Therefore, its removal will ensure a more certain and secure environment for the future of medical graduates and lessen the unrest which has been effectively fomented by vested interests.The Labor Party have given in to vested interests. They have been prepared to do what is expedient rather than what is right by rural Australia. The Leader of the Opposition has got no ticker on this. He is prepared to tag along with whatever is easiest to do, and he has sold out rural Australia.</DOC>

 - As usual, the member for Hotham is false and misleading the House. No changes were forced on me whatsoever last night, as I think at least 120 members and senators who were independent witnesses would attest. That is because the Ralph measures have been introduced as recommended by Mr Ralph with a transition measure in relation to people who were in the prescribed payments system, who have two years in which to get a determination from the commissioner and will be recognised because they are in the prescribed payments system during that period. This was put in place as a transitional measure to prevent the commissioner having to give 230,000 private determinations by 1 July. People in the prescribed payments system have already been recognised - by virtue of being in the prescribed payments system and not under PAYE - as not being employees. They are precisely the people that Mr Ralph recommended should not be part of this system. I will actually read what Mr Ralph said, if you like, because I think you will be so embarrassed when you see the legislation. We might as well get to the point now. Mr Ralph said that the measures should apply to people who were `employee-like', who rendered services to a service requirer in an `employee-like manner'. That is, the measure should apply to people who worked in an `employee-like manner'. Mr Ralph said that they should not apply to people who were independent contractors. He said the mechanism for telling the difference, whether you are working in an employee-like manner, would relate, inter alia, to:. . . the manner in which services are being carried out having regard to the level of control exercised by the service requirer in relation to matters such as the time of work and actual hours of work required and where the services are to be performed;In other words, if the service requirer did not have the power to direct in relation to hours, time of work and where the services were to be performed, the services would not be performed in an employee-like manner and the measures would not apply. That is the test you will find in the legislation, where the test of the independent contractor is set out, the test of the independent contractor at common law - namely, the difference between a contract of service and a contract for services. A contract for services is where a contract is entered into for a job where the contractor remains at risk and where the contractor is required to supply their own plant or equipment. That is the test. - When I am asked whether or not we are implementing the Ralph recommendation and I go to what Ralph recommended and then I go to what is in the legislation, on any view, it is precisely relevant. - It is precisely on the point of law that I am addressing the House. Mr Ralph said that people who are rendering services to a service requirer in an employee-like manner should be paying tax on the marginal rate. What the government is introducing in legislation - for the first time; never done under 13 years of Labor government - is a provision which says people who are not in business and are not independent contractors will be taxed as individuals at the marginal rate. The test of an independent contractor is found in the legislation. - Because they implement the Ralph recommendations in full, in the full-year effect the revenue is as costed in the policy. If you were only to wait until the legislation was introduced, you would have all of the costings and all of the legislation to prove that we have followed the Ralph requirements in full within the full year outside the two-year transition period and with the full cost being recovered, which was factored into previous budget statements.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. I recognise the great interest that he takes in Australian foreign policy and international issues. He makes a very valuable contribution to the government and to the parliament on those issues. As members know, the government's approach to the region is one of practical engagement. As we have seen in recent times the government has been engaging very successfully in practical ways with our neighbours in ASEAN through the AFTA CER process. We have made good and constructive progress in our dealings with Indonesia in recent times and a significant contribution to helping to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula between North Korea - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - and South Korea.I think one of the things this government will be remembered for, too, is the practical role - not just the rhetorical role - we played in bringing to an end civil war and conflict in Bougainville and in East Timor. Now, over the last few days, we have been playing a particularly active role in trying to assist the Solomon Islands government in bringing to an end the tension - indeed one could go so far as to say that the conflict - that currently exists in the Solomon Islands. I would just like to take this moment to acknowledge that there has been very close cooperation on this matter with the New Zealand government and my New Zealand counterpart Phil Goff. I must say that the New Zealand government has been extraordinarily cooperative and a very warm and close partner as we have worked through this issue of the Solomon Islands.The honourable member asked whether there was any alternative approach to this. I can say to the House that, like many members, I read with some interest an article in the Bulletin this week that included an interview with the Leader of the Opposition. As usual, little was devoted to the issue of foreign policy. However, on foreign policy the Leader of the Opposition claimed that if he were the Prime Minister he would somehow be more active. But of course we never hear how. He just says, `I would be more active' and then moves on to the next round of attacks on the government. We never know. I suppose the Leader of the Opposition himself would not have read that article because he has made it clear that he does not like to read articles about himself in case he might be hurt by the criticisms. I would have thought if ever there was an example of somebody lacking ticker that was as good an example as you would ever find. Despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition says he would be more active, it has to be said that within Australia, outside of the parliament, we find no record of him making any speech on foreign policy at all in 17 months. For a man who wishes to be active in this field, he has 17 barren months behind him. As for the member for Kingsford-Smith, it is interesting to record how often he asks questions on these issues that he says he is so interested in and that we should be more active on. Over the last 141 days the member for Kingsford-Smith has failed to ask a single question on the great issues of Australia's engagement with our region and the world. This has been an extraordinarily exciting and interesting period in international history, but for 141 days he has not thought it worth while asking a question. Of course you do not get paid for asking questions, so that is perhaps why he does not bother. The only person on the Labor side who talks about foreign policy is the former leader Paul Keating. This is the man, the House will remember, who said that if he had remained Prime Minister and if all of them had remained in government, there never would have been an Asian economic crisis. If the Leader of the Opposition had still been Deputy Prime Minister, Asia would have been spared its economic crisis. Of course Mr Keating's attack on the government over East Timor is not repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition, who obviously, by his silence, associates himself with Mr Keating and with Mr Keating's low-grade views on high-grade policy.</DOC>

 - I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes on about mobile phones, which is a new issue to me. It is certainly not part of the legislation. He is one of those people who, if unable to make a point on the facts, will try to change the facts in order to try to make some kind of grubby political point. As I said earlier, I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be better informed if he actually read the legislation which is being introduced this afternoon. I think people should hear the allegation he just put. The allegation he just put is that people who are in the prescribed payments system would, because they are in the prescribed payments system, be able to avoid tax. That was his proposition. If the prescribed payments system was not actually introduced by the Australian Labor Party -  - I do not know. It might have been introduced earlier, but certainly over 13 years of Labor Party policy I never heard the Labor Party complain about the prescribed payments system. In order to go into the prescribed payments system, you had to get a declaration. The declaration showed that you were not in the PAYE system; you had already been recognised for the purposes of taxation as not being in the PAYE system, and you had a determination from the commissioner to that effect. If you have a determination to that effect, what the government have sensibly said is that you can rely on that during the transitional period. We will do that rather than have 230,000 people, 120,000 of whom are already under the PPS, come in for individual declarations between now and 1 July. I would have thought it was a very, very sensible system.Leaving aside this matter of tax, let me make one last point. The Labor Party is obviously not interested in tax from this measure. If it was, it might have done something in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993 or 1995. What the Labor Party really hates is independent contractors. The Labor Party hates independent contractors because they do not join the CFMEU, which produces union officials that sit on the Labor Party front bench. On this side of the House, we have always recognised the rights of independent contractors and will go on recognising them. They were recognised by John Ralph, and we are not going to be a party to the CFMEU, or the puppets that it pulls here, trying to use independent contractors to get them back into trade unions. We respect the rights of independent contractors, people who are genuinely in business, who undertake some risk and who have always been recognised as being subcontractors. We want to make sure that their rights continue to be respected. </DOC>

 - I note that there were just two CES offices in the electorate of Deakin a few years ago and that there are now 10 Job Network sites. I thank the member for his question. I am aware that in her MPI speech yesterday the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for employment and training, said that the Job Network was failing job seekers. She said that she was receiving letters and phone calls almost every day from dissatisfied job seekers. I know that MPs on both sides of this House do sometimes get letters of complaint. I know this because they always forward them to me, and my department does its best to resolve the matters. I know that there is a job seeker complaints hotline. Its phone number is 1800 805260. That has handled some 13,000 complaints over the last two years from an average of 800,000 registered job seekers at any one time. I am pleased to say that 95 per cent of these complaints have been cleared up within five days.The interesting thing is that, despite receiving letters every day, the member for Dickson has not made a single representation on behalf of job seekers. In the 18 months that I have been responsible for the Job Network and in the six months that she has been shadow minister for employment and training, she has not made one representation on behalf of job seekers. The question is: what is she doing with all these letters? She is not running an electorate office; she is running a dead-letter office. The sad thing is that she is not helping her constituents; she is using their letters as nothing but political ammunition, and that is a very sad indictment of any local member. - The member for Dickson also repeated Labor's tired claims that the Job Network was a failure because it did not necessarily provide training. I have a document in my possession headed up `employment information' which states: The Job Network member can put together a tailored package to meet an employer's particular business needs. This could include short-listing and interviewing job applicants, wage subsidies, training or other support.As if to emphasise the point, on the next page this document states:Job Network members can use their fees to provide training or wage subsidies. This is an official brochure distributed by the Labor member for Paterson. This is what the member for Paterson thinks the Job Network does.  - Obviously the member for Dickson has not persuaded the member for Paterson nor has she persuaded the members for Hotham, Batman, Hunter, Dobell, Barton, Cunningham, Corio, Banks, Bowman, Perth, Lilley and Wills, her fellow frontbenchers who all walked out on her yesterday before she walked out on the debate that she had herself instituted.  -  - They really are a pretty rum mob opposite. There are the know-alls who write books and then there are the know-nothings -  - There are the know-alls opposite who write books and there are the know-nothings who are too frightened to look at the newspaper every day. - I am very, very happy to help the member for Dickson to resolve the problems that are brought to her attention. But she has got to bring them to my attention first. She has got to table these letters, bring the letters to me and show me the letters before she puts them in a pathetic press release.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question and I also acknowledge her significant and continuing contribution on economic matters to the government and to the House. Yesterday, I indicated clearly that the government intends to fully privatise Telstra. That policy is subject to an independent telecommunications service inquiry which will determine the adequacy of service levels, particularly in regional Australia. That inquiry is under way. Whilst I will not pre-empt the outcome of that inquiry, I do know that Australia needs a large telecommunications company which is globally competitive. I noted from a breakout story in the Australian Financial Review this morning that the Leader of the Opposition will address the Sydney Institute tonight in what has been billed as a landmark speech on Labor's policy for Telstra's future. That article indicates that the Leader of the Opposition may attempt to justify Labor's antiprivatisation stand. That is a stand, of course, which Labor shares with Cuba and North Korea - the antiprivatisation stand. He may attempt to justify that stand tonight by arguing that Telstra's dividends will outweigh in economic terms the economic benefit of retiring about $50 billion worth of government debt that could occur if there were full privatisation.  I hope this speech addresses the real issues on Telstra such as: how does Labor expect Telstra to compete in this rapidly changing and increasingly globalised telecommunications industry while it remains shackled to government ownership? This is an industry in which companies like AAPT are permitted to grow at rates exceeding 20 per cent per annum, yet Telstra is restricted from using a commonly used business strategy of raising capital through offering shares. Telstra is forced to tap into its precious cash reserves or go into debt to fund expansion, and it must do that in order to compete and in order to survive. How can Labor claim to rely on Telstra's future dividend stream to fund its new nation building initiatives when Telstra's capacity to compete globally is undermined by continued majority government ownership? How can Labor assure the 2.1 million Australian shareholders, the people who have invested their financial futures in Telstra, that there would be anything left if the decisions on business were made by the member for Perth here in Parliament House if Labor were ever in government? How can Labor guarantee that Telstra is going to have the financial capacity to invest in the network that will provide telecommunications to regional Australia if again it is constrained from operating in a truly commercial market and operating on a sound business plan?If you want Telstra to fund nation building initiatives, you do not gamble on the assets of Australian taxpayers; you do not assume that there will be an ongoing flow of dividends when you constrain the capacity of the company to be in that market and to compete. You reduce debt, as this government has done in reducing Labor's debt, using the proceeds from the sale of Telstra. You reduce the public debt interest payments. You put money into social benefits. Some $2.2 billion from the proceeds of the sale of Telstra has gone into regional and rural Australia. And, of course, you make room to fund programs in the health, education and welfare areas which the sale of Telstra and the reduction of public debt interest has allowed.One thing is certain: if Labor ever get into government, they will sell the rest of Telstra. As I said yesterday, the article about the Leader of the Opposition in the Bulletin entitled `The Accidental Leader' states: He is against the sale of Telstra but he didn't really used to be and many in his inner circle are convinced he would sell it if in officeWe know what the Leader of the Opposition did when he was the Minister for Finance. He sold Qantas for some $1.45 billion. He sold half the Commonwealth Bank for some $1.7 billion. He sold the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories for $299 million. What did the Australian people get as a result? They got the highest unemployment on record, the highest unemployment for decades, $10 billion worth of budget deficit and $98 billion worth of increased general government debt. Two things are certain: Labor in government would not roll back the GST; they would sell Telstra.</DOC>

 - What I said in the letter was to remind the member for Dobell of an arrangement that was announced last year arising out of the discussions that we had with the Australian Democrats.  - It was made very clearly and very openly last year and it was made very clear in the letter I wrote to the member for Dobell that for people who regard themselves, by reason of being outside the social security or income tax system, as not getting the benefits that people within the social security and income tax system get under tax reform, there is a mechanism.  - That does not amount, as the member for Dobell so erroneously claimed, to a concession that there will be, to use his words, `losers under the GST'. If, in fact, there is a mechanism whereby people who claim that they are not within the social security system or within the tax system but are affected by the introduction of a goods and services tax can seek replacement compensation, they cannot by definition be losers. That is why the claim made by the member for Dobell is completely wrong.This claim made by the member for Dobell is of a piece with the claim made this morning by the Leader of the Opposition in his regular doorstop. No wonder he does not read newspapers; he is talking all the time. Outside Parliament House this morning, the Leader of the Opposition angrily drew attention to the fact that under the GST plan, under the maps that were released yesterday by the government -  - Mr Speaker, what I was referring to was an element of the tax reform package. The question asked by the member for Dobell related to tax reform. I was making the point that the Leader of the Opposition this morning made the absolutely unbelievable claim that the fact that some people are going to get the diesel rebate and others are not is the fault of the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I know that she is a vigorous fighter for communications infrastructure in her electorate. She, like all members on the government side and the rural and regional constituents we represent, will be very pleased at Telstra's announcement yesterday: $350 million new and additional investment in upgrading of rural telecommunications infrastructure, on top of $700 million earlier this year. Of course, it has been welcomed by our constituents, by the NFF. Interestingly, it will create 700 new jobs over the life of that three-year project. It is going to commence very shortly and will focus on those areas experiencing the poorest and the worst service. What has been lost, I notice, in public commentary on this issue recently is the compulsion on Telstra to invest amounts of this size in the customer guarantee service, which this government introduced and which holds Telstra in a monetary sense to introducing new levels of service for rural and regional customers. This money is a direct response of the government's legislation, which we introduced - something that the opposition, when they were in government, failed to do, and, of course, they are now riding in on our coat tails.I am also asked by the honourable member whether there are alternative policies - and I think we know the answer to that. There simply are not on the part of the ALP - and no wonder, when you look at the most profound, intensive interview profile on the Leader of the Opposition in a very long time, `The Accidental Leader', the man who does not read newspapers. If he is not going to read the major dailies of metropolitan Australia, he certainly is not going to read anything from regional Australia. He does not know what is happening in regional Australia. Why else would he claim that his secret weapons, his most powerful salesmen in regional and rural Australia, are the member for Hotham and the member for Batman, former ACTU chiefs? What he says is this:When asked about how Labor will win the bush, he says - with a straight face - that Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson are popular in rural Australia...Oh yeah, well let's test it. Why don't you go out and tell them -  - What are the alternative policies proposed by the ALP and others in regard to regional Australia? It is obviously to send out the former ACTU presidents to win over the bush. Mr Beazley is quoted in the article:'It is not going to be difficult,' says Mr Beazley. 'They actually like Crean and Ferguson. They remember Crean when he was primary industries minister ... Ferguson when he was ACTU president made a speciality of bush workers.They made a speciality of putting them out of work, particularly in abattoirs. They remember you all right. So you go out, the new bobbsey twins, the new glimmer twins -  -  - And he does not read newspapers. Mr Speaker, you do not have to be a psychologist to know that this is a Leader of the Opposition in denial and he is taking everybody else with him. He does not know what is happening in regional Australia. So, to finish my point, when you go out as the bobbsey twins, take a couple of others: the member for Melbourne, secretary of the clerks union; the member for Brisbane, secretary of the teachers union - what a delegation that would be - and let us see the welcome you would get.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and, given the enormous size of the electorate that he represents, he will know just how important the reduction in transport costs is to the wellbeing and future opportunities of the people he represents. As I commented yesterday in the House, there is no doubt that the confirmation of our reform to taxation arrangements in relation to transport have been very widely welcomed. Whether it is the National Farmers Federation or the Australian trucking industry saying that this is a win-win not only for industry but also for Australia, or whether it is the VFF or whoever, it has been very widely welcomed.However, I do notice there is a little misunderstanding about how it will actually operate. It is not hard to think that there might be some who have a bit of a vested interest in confusing how it might operate. Indeed, those opposite are responsible. They are getting around as best they can some quite extraordinary misinformation about how the new arrangements will work. In fact, a very good example of this emerged this morning in a doorstop interview with the Leader of the Opposition when he said:Now we see this extraordinary mapping of Australia with thin grey lines going down highways and areas massively disadvantaged by finding themselves on one particular side of the line.It is quite evident that the Leader of the Opposition has no idea about how the new arrangements will work - and it is probably because he does not read - so it is therefore important that I inform the House. At the outset, all business users will be able to claim a credit for the GST on fuel. So all businesses will find business fuel costs fall by around 10 per cent. In addition, I reiterate that businesses running 20 tonnes gross vehicle mass or more for road transport anywhere in Australia will have access to the grand scheme to reduce excise to 20c a litre. Businesses running vehicles between 4½ tonnes and 20 tonnes GVM will also have access to the grant if they are servicing non-metropolitan areas.Here are a couple of critical points that the Leader of the Opposition, and those who might be ill advised enough to listen to him, ought to take on board. Firstly, it does not matter where the business has its premises. That is irrelevant. Secondly, it does not matter where the business buys its fuel. What matters is the journey undertaken by the vehicle - between two places outside a metropolitan area, between a metropolitan area and a country area or between two metropolitan areas. The only journeys that will not attract the grant are journeys within metropolitan areas, and those six are defined as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong; Melbourne and Geelong; Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast; Adelaide; Perth; and Canberra. The boundaries were drawn, as is known, on the basis of statistical local areas. If at least 20 per cent of an SLA was a contiguous urban area centre, it was considered metropolitan, and there we basically have the maps.I want to return to what the Leader of the Opposition said this morning. He clearly misunderstands how the scheme will work and he clearly misrepresents those who will win and those who will miss out. The most appalling aspect of this is that, when he points to those he describes as massively disadvantaged, he fails absolutely to display the courage necessary to point out the one central elementary fact in all of this: inasmuch as the arrangements are a little more complicated than we originally intended them to be, that is wholly, solely and completely the fault of the Labor Party in this place. There is no other way around it. It is the fault of a Leader of the Opposition with no vision, no courage and no capacity to take forward the interests of rural and regional Australia, let alone the broader Australian economy. He ought to do nothing short of apologising.</DOC>

 - I have been having regular meetings with the proponents of the Speedrail project now for some years. After all, the route goes through my electorate and it is of significance to my constituents. I am continually given a briefing on the progress. On a number of occasions, they have come to the seat of Macarthur and conducted community meetings, and they have kept me informed of those things. I am very grateful that they have kept me informed, and I have endeavoured to give them every assistance that I can within the proper bounds.I can say very, very clearly that when the government made a decision following the report that was put together by the officials of three governments - the federal government, the New South Wales government and the ACT government - to nominate a preferred tenderer, and that decision was announced in August 1998, from that point on it was a case of looking at the details that could be brought forward by the preferred tenderer. The government's condition has been - and this has always been stated by me - that it be at no cost to budget. Many proposals that have been discussed with me have indicated that that represents some difficulties or otherwise. The report that has come through is being evaluated at the present time. I have not seen it, but I have made it abundantly clear that the government's rules are that it be at no cost to budget. If they think that there is a capacity of government to do otherwise, I have indicated that there is nothing that I know that would suggest otherwise.The honourable member asked me something about the chairman of Leightons. I think I am aware - I am not certain of this - that he is on the board of Leightons. Whether he is the chairman or not, I do not know. I do not know what that has to do with the Speedrail project. I do not know what that has to do with the fact that there are many, many organisations who will come and talk to me as a member of parliament and in my role and who will give me some ideas about what they want to do. All I can say is that the government's rules are clear. I have certainly stuck by them in all my conversations. If there is to be a decision on Speedrail - and it is yet to be determined whether it may or may not be favourable - the rules in place at this point in time are that it be at no cost to budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The government is not only reforming the indirect tax system in Australia to take place on 1 July, reforming family payments to take place on 1 July and cutting income taxes in Australia's largest ever income tax cut on 1 July but also reforming the business taxation system. That has involved cuts in capital gains tax, particularly of benefit to small business. The cuts in capital gains tax and company tax have given Australia a new international competitiveness and have made Australia a good destination for foreign investment.First of all, on capital gains tax, prior to the government's reforms, the top rate of capital gains tax in Australia was 48.5 per cent compared with 34 per cent in the UK and 18 per cent in the US. That top rate has been cut to 24¼ per cent, which is lower than the UK top rate at 34 per cent and only slightly above the US rate at 18 per cent. Our bottom rate of capital gains tax now at 15 per cent is again lower than the UK and slightly above that of the US. In relation to company tax, however, the government's reforms, the first instalment of which takes place on 1 July - cutting the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 34 per cent, and then a year later from 34 per cent to 30 per cent - will mean that Australia has a lower company tax rate than the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Korea; will be on a par with rates in Germany and the United Kingdom; and will be, outside of Hong Kong and Singapore, the lowest company tax rate in the Asia region. This means that Australia is now an attractive destination for foreign investment. I read some statements, which were put out earlier in the week by some foreign analysts, saying that one of the key things you could do to improve the investment climate in Australia was the privatisation of Telstra. I think that point was being made by Mr Hale. We know that, by having a telecommunications sector in our stock exchange, we have been able to hook that stock exchange into new high-tech indexes, which have put Australia on the map in relation to foreign investment. We would not have had a telecommunications sector on the Australian Stock Exchange if it had not been for this government's effort for the privatisation of Telstra.For foreign investors, we now have arguably one of the most competitive capital gains tax regimes amongst developed countries. We now have a low rate by regional standards. Australia is a good destination for investment. That means more jobs for young Australians. This means that this government is about building an internationally competitive business taxation system for the future in this country.</DOC>

I note with interest his determination to defend the honour of public servants - something that is not shared obviously by his colleagues on the front bench, who only yesterday in this House used the privilege of parliament to besmirch the reputation of people who give honourable service to our country. - I am certainly aware that there have been allegations about the AFMA board, particularly in relation to the way it dealt with the Northern Prawn Fishery management plan, and a range of concerns raised by trawler operators, particularly in North Queensland but indeed in other parts of Australia. Those allegations were brought to my attention quite some time ago. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources was no doubt referring to those sorts of allegations in his comments. I have provided the necessary information to my department for examination. At their suggestion, I wrote to the relevant parties and offered, if they were prepared to provide details of their allegations, to refer them to the Federal Police for examination. No information was forthcoming and so, in that regard, I consider the matter closed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and also for his continuing interest in defence matters as a member of the committee in particular. On Friday I had the pleasure of seeing off our latest contingent of troops to East Timor, the 6RAR from the Enoggera barracks in Brisbane. They will form part of the 1,900 Australian troops remaining in East Timor as part of our contribution to UNTAET. Tomorrow, elements of 6RAR will relieve 5/7RAR. They will continue to provide a vital security presence along the east and west Timor border. Whilst the government welcomes the progress that has been made to date by the Indonesian government to curb militia activities, militia continue to disrupt East Timorese reconstruction. There are therefore risks involved in any deployment. However, the ADF troops are very well trained and skilled to deal with any situations that may arise. Australia can be rightly proud of the troops' efforts in East Timor. We can also be proud of the way in which the families of Australian servicemen and servicewomen have supported them through this difficult time. They have all played and are playing an important part in bringing peace to East Timor. I am sure all members of the House will join me in thanking the men and women of 5/7RAR for the excellent job they have done, at the same time wishing those going, 6RAR, the very best of good fortune.  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I advise the House that I recently went to Western Australia to meet with the TPI veterans over there and had a very good meeting with them. They raised a number of questions with me relating to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the entitlements that they receive. I do take my job as veterans' affairs minister very seriously. I did go to Western Australia at the request of local members to talk with those members of the TPI Association in Western Australia. Following that meeting, I met with the state president of the RSL to discuss the issue with him as well. On my return to Canberra, I have spoken with the national president of the TPI Association and I have had discussions with him about the motions of no confidence in me. I take the issue very seriously, as does the government. The Veterans' Entitlements Act has been built up over many, many years and the entitlement has been progressed by successive governments. We have always sought on both sides of the House, I believe, to err on the side of generosity. I think that could be said for both sides of this parliament. I know that there will be a national conference of the TPI Association in the next month. I certainly will be waiting to hear of resolutions from that as well as from the RSL National Congress which also will be held later this year. I do keep in touch with the ex-service community. I think it would be agreed on both sides of the House that it is the responsibility of government to always refer -  - It was actually under the previous government that statements of principles were reviewed, and when we came to government those statements of principles were ones that we said we would review in consultation with the ex-service community. I have to give credit - and I think the ex-service community do - to the way those statements of principles were introduced under the former minister, Con Sciacca. There has been no change to the Veterans' Entitlements Act in relation to those statements of principles. </DOC>

 - I can inform the House that very recently my attention was drawn to some very powerful arguments in favour of the full privatisation of Telstra. They are arguments that were very cogently put in a very, very long speech under the heading of `Asset sales: putting privatisation into perspective'. The two principal arguments contained in this speech really did grab my attention, and I agreed with them. I thought they went to the nub of the matter, to the centrality of this issue of public policy debate at the present time. The first of those arguments went as follows:But there are broader benefits to be gained from moving the ownership of assets into the private sector, most notably in achieving greater efficiency, stronger performance and improved competitiveness in some of our key national enterprises. Mark those words - `greater efficiency, stronger performance and improved competitiveness in some of our key national enterprises'. That was a very, very strong argument. I was very much impressed with that argument, and it was put with great directness and great lucidity. But that was not the end of it. I read further into that speech and I found another compelling argument, and this goes even more centrally to the debate about the sale of Telstra. It read:Some require - talking of enterprises - freedom from the residual constraints of government ownership - mark the word `residual'; you could even read 50.1 per cent into `residual', couldn't you? - to perform their full potential, including the freedom to seek capital from the market appropriate to the balance between risk and reward that only the shareholders of a privatised company are prepared to accept.I would give that almost 10 out of 10 as a statement in favour of privatisation of some of our great national enterprises. You could almost be forgiven for believing that that particular speech was directed towards the sale of the rest of Telstra. I think it probably was preparing the way for the sale of Telstra, because that speech was delivered on Thursday, 7 July 1994 to a gathering of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia at the Hyatt Hotel in Perth - and that gives you a little clue as to the author of the speech, doesn't it? I repeat the title of the speech: `Asset Sales - putting privatisation into perspective: an address by the Hon. Kim C. Beazley, the Minister for Finance'. I have to say, in all charity that should possess us all on occasions, that it was a very good speech. It was the speech of a person who believed then, as he will again if there is a turn of the electoral cycle, in the cause of privatisation. I understand that that same gentleman is tonight to deliver a speech roughly carrying the title `Why the rest of Telstra should not be sold'. In those circumstances and having read this speech, perhaps the title should be amended to read `Why the rest of Telstra should not be sold until we get back into government', because, deep down, the realities that possessed the Leader of the Opposition as then the Minister for Finance to make that speech in 1994 exist even more now. On this, as on so many other things, unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is walking both sides of the street.  - When he is in government he is all in favour of privatisation; when he is in opposition he is against it. When he was in government he was in favour of Paul Keating's option C, he was in favour of tax reform; now he is against it. But, of course, if he gets back into government he will be in favour of it again. Instead of walking both sides of the street - </DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the remarks that I made in January to which he made reference were totally justified then and remain the case. They were observations on the comments of spokesmen for various trading banks - one in particular - and I have no regrets about those remarks at all. As to the relationship between those remarks and subsequent movements in the level of the Australian dollar, what I find interesting is the following paragraph in the Reserve Bank's February analysis of the economy and financial markets. I quote directly from the report:The exchange rate was volatile ahead of the policy decisions of early February, initially dropping in late January by US3c overnight to a low of US62.2c.I emphasise this:The catalyst for this sharp fall ... I repeat:The catalyst for this sharp fall was the release of favourable CPI data in Australia which reduced market expectations and monetary policy tightening at the same time as data releases in the US pointed to the possibility that monetary tightening in that country might be greater than had been expected.There is no reference there to any comments by me or, indeed, by anybody else. I would also, by way of addendum, make the observation that I am very pleased to note that I lead a government whose Treasurer has never been so reckless as to boast, as a former Treasurer of this nation did in 1989 or 1990, that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Yesterday, I wrote to the President of Indonesia and, amongst other things, said that his proposal for a tripartite meeting involving the President of Indonesia, the Prime Minister of Australia and Xanana Gusmao, the East Timorese leader, was one that we reacted to favourably, although I said to the President that I thought it appropriate that a bilateral meeting between the President and me take place before any three-way meeting.In the course of that letter, I expressed the respect of the Australian government and, I believe, the parliament of this country for the greater transparency that Dr Wahid has brought to the government of Indonesia, the steps that he has taken to restore democracy in that country, and the leadership he has given to the Republic of Indonesia in relation to economic matters. I also noted and welcomed the fact that he stated a desire to visit Australia. I said that in itself a visit by an Indonesian President, the first in 25 years, would be a very important event in the bilateral relationship between the two countries. I suggested that the officials of both Australia and Indonesia have further discussions about a projected date for the President's visit. I also inform the House that I spoke at length to Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta at Kirribilli House on Saturday morning. They gave me an outline of the progress being made to establish the infrastructure of government in East Timor. I reiterated the ongoing support of the Australian government. We discussed relations between the emerging nation of East Timor, Indonesia and Australia. I emphasised to Mr Gusmao the importance, in our view, of the people of East Timor - notwithstanding the very tragic history of relations between their people and Indonesia - establishing close relations between that territory and the government and the people of Indonesia.I have said on earlier occasions that it was inevitable, given the action taken by Australia last year in relation to East Timor - correct action that won the support and respect of the world - that relations between Australia and Indonesia would be strained as a consequence and that the relationship in the future would not be what it was in the past but that that does not mean it will not be a very positive and mutually beneficial relationship, provided it is based upon mutual respect - a respect and understanding on the part of Australia of the history, culture and values of Indonesia and also a respect and understanding by the Indonesians of the history, culture and values of Australia. I believe that, over time, we will move towards a closer relationship, one that will inevitably be different but, nonetheless, one that is very soundly based.</DOC>

 - As stated in the question, I did put out a press release on 15 January 2000. The honourable member noted that I said in the first paragraph that I:...today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.I ask the members of the opposition to note the words `business initiatives' because those words were used as a direct response to suggestions by Qantas that its frequent flyer prices were approved by the ACCC. This suggested that the ACCC had entered into a public compliance agreement with Qantas. There was no formal direction, nor any suggestion of a formal direction, under section 29 of the Trade Practices Act, because public compliance agreements are an administrative tool used by the ACCC to ensure the effective implementation of the new taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I acknowledge his very real interest in this matter. The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy will have a major emphasis on boosting the opportunities available to country people. The Prime Minister recently announced this new approach in Melbourne. Around half of the $240 million dedicated to this strategy will be spent in rural, regional and remote areas where the need is, arguably, the greatest. Indeed, it will focus on strengthening marriages and relationships, on the needs of families with young children by helping people to balance the demands of work and raising a family, and on building communities by promoting leadership and supporting volunteers. Included in the $240 million Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a recognition of many of the challenges faced by rural families due to isolation, economic hardship and a lack of resources in communities. Particularly importantly, it will be very flexible. It will be able to be tailored to meet local needs. As was repeatedly put to me in relation to rural programs: no one size fits all. This strategy is highly flexible. There will be $40 million for a Stronger Families Fund for locally developed programs to help families with parenting during early childhood years. This sort of support can go to such outstanding programs as the Good Beginnings National Parenting Project. Good Beginnings involves home visits by trained volunteers and support for fathers support groups, personal health assistance and information sessions for new parents and Parenting from the Inside, support groups for parents in prison. It will also involve support for community building programs, the production of resource information, the creation of professional development learning packages and the facilitation of community development programs - for example, that which exists at Clarendon with their Clarendon Vale Connect Program.There is $47.3 million to provide practical skills and support for families and parents, including making family counselling more widely available in rural and regional areas. There is around $65 million to fund a new subsidy for in-home care, which will be of real benefit to families living in rural areas too far away to find child-care centres readily accessible. There is also the provision of $37 million to a leadership development program which will help to identify and support potential community leaders. As has been so frequently identified, including at last year's Regional Australia Summit, it is only through strong local leadership that disadvantaged communities will be able to meet their challenges and to secure a better future.Also included in the package is $15 million for a local solutions fund, which will make small grants to local groups seeking to initiate community projects such as the conversion of unused buildings into community activity centres. I commend the Minister for Family and Community Services, Jocelyn Newman, for the very hard work that she has put into developing this program. I believe it will be of real benefit right across the nation and in particular to those rural and regional communities that are looking to provide leadership and innovation at a time of great change. I think, too, that it underscores a real commitment on the part of this government to an investment in the bonds that underpin family and community life, a commitment never really achieved at all by the ALP during its 13 years in government.</DOC>

 - It is a three-step approach. Section 75AU of the Trade Practices Act deals with price exploitation in relation to the new tax system changes. It states that price exploitation occurs if the price is unreasonably high in regard to the new tax system changes. It also lists a number of other conditions. Section 75AV of the Trade Practices Act requires the ACCC to formulate guidelines on what constitutes price exploitation. Before 15 January this was implicit in the ACCC's guidelines in the net dollar margin rule. After 15 January, and in paragraph 2.20 of the new ACCC guidelines, there is a price rule which states, `The price rule is that no price should rise by more than 10 per cent as a result of the new tax system changes.' </DOC>

 - I do know about this manual. I first heard about it in February. The issue was raised then in the Senate, I think it was, and the matter was put to Dr Shergold, the secretary of my department. He gave a full explanation and made the point that it was a document prepared for a training session on negotiations and that it contained, importantly, a disclaimer stating that the authors did not endorse any unethical tactics. The whole purpose of the document was to give people an idea of how to properly manage a negotiating practice. This was not good enough for the opposition, in particular the shadow minister, one of the frontbench on the other side which, I would have to say, as this episode reveals, must be the weakest frontbench on an opposition side since World War II. This is a classic case of having no idea about what you are doing and no idea of what to do, except to do what you are told by your union mates. This is the trouble you get into. Easter conjures up the thought of Easter eggs. You think of Easter eggs and look closely at the face of the shadow minister. If you look closely enough, you will see the egg still on his face. He and his mate at the Sydney Morning Herald decided they would reheat the story over Easter, and their story was that the government was promoting unethical tactics. And did they go to town on the story. - I will come to you in a minute.  - He said:This document is a sad reflection of the Howard government's attitude to Australian workers. As minister, he must accept ownership of this offensive management tool. Peter Reith's latest attack on workers was produced by his own department. Minister Reith should stop passing the buck to everyone else. The negotiation manual was produced by his department. It is a guide to unethical negotiation tactics.Mr Speaker, as we now know, this manual has been in operation and was in fact produced under the previous Labor government. One member of the frontbench on the other side challenged me to produce the document, we produced it, and we found that it was sourced back to early 1994. It was approved by a committee chaired by the CPSU, who said it was offensive. It was prepared as a training manual under the previous Labor government for an ILO training course in Vanuatu in 1995. It has been used in sessions of training, not just with management but with the CPSU, on 27 January 1994, 23 February 1994 and 17 March 1994, and that is just to confirm the accuracy of it. The fact is that you have got no idea what you are doing. You thought you would reheat an old story. It was false from the start, it was in fact prepared by the Labor Party, and you are not strong enough to stand up and apologise. Furthermore, this weak Leader of the Opposition ought to bring these people into line. You have gone on an attack -  -  - Laurie Brereton is chuckling in the background. What a joke! Laurie, to use the words of your own colleague - if what Arch says is right - `It is a sad reflection on Laurie Brereton's attitude to Australian workers. Laurie Brereton must accept ownership of this offensive management tool. This is Laurie Brereton's latest attack on workers.'The fact is that they went out and attacked a whole lot of public servants, and the Leader of the Opposition ought to demand an apology from this weak shadow minister. He ought to go on the public record and see if he can wipe some of that egg off his face.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I do not take gratis what the shadow Assistant Treasurer has said about Professor Fels. What I would like him to consider, as he has raised the issue of doorstops, is that the Labor Party launched one of the most vicious attacks on a public servant in a doorstop outside of this parliament, with the attack by the shadow Assistant Treasurer on the Commissioner of Taxation. The attack by Senator Conroy on the chairman of the ACCC was the most vicious -  - Mr Speaker, the matter is comprehensively dealt with in the ACCC's pricing guidelines, which have been constructed after extensive consultation with the business community and consumer groups. I reiterate that attacking the chairman of the ACCC is no substitute for good policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note that the member for Batman, as the spokesman opposite, may be groping a little closer towards a policy development framework in the area of transport. Maybe! He recently told the Australian Trucking Association:The opposition has been looking closely at the issue of road funding.That is about as far as it goes. To all intents and purposes, the policy is written on the flip side of the tax policy; it is on that blank sheet of paper. But he has drawn some interesting but ugly false conclusions. - I will in a moment. Mr Speaker, I have just been invited to tell them about what the government is doing, and I intend to do just that. I never hear the member for Paterson complaining about all the money that is being spent on the Pacific Highway, which would not be being spent if the Labor Party were in power. The conclusion that the member for Batman has drawn, and that he is now out there busily promoting, is that the government is using the GST as an excuse to push responsibility for road funding onto the states. The first point that ought to be noted is that I think it is entirely legitimate to say to the states that, with their increased revenue flow, they might have the flexibility to do a little more in the future. The second point - a very important point - is that the member for Batman ought to take a little history lesson. The history lesson is this: at a special Premiers Conference of 1990 - I think we all remember who was in power then - it was agreed to untie federal funding allocations to the states. It was the ALP that decided it would get out of funding all roads bar the national highway grid. Thus my point indeed is that the Pacific Highway is happening under us - the road that the member for Cowper has pushed so enthusiastically for so long is now the biggest government sector funded infrastructure project happening since the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is happening under us, not the ALP -   - because it was the ALP that got out of the business of funding important roads, which we now describe as RONIs, and the Black Spot Program. Mr Speaker, the ALP has no policy prescriptions whatsoever. It has got no further than saying that it is looking closely at the issue of road funding. - The member for Batman says again that we are not doing much for state roads, yet we are funding new port and freight access roads between Melbourne and Geelong. We are funding new port and freight access roads in Brisbane, Adelaide and Cairns. We have already funded port roads at Devonport and Darwin. We have offered to contribute to a new road to the port of Gladstone, in the member for Hinkler's electorate, and he knows how important that is. So there we have it.Finally, Mr Ferguson also said to the Australian Trucking Association, on the issue of safety, that Labor is developing a comprehensive and innovative strategy for transport safety. This is the team that abandoned the Black Spot Program. These are the people who gave up a program that has saved hundreds of Australian lives, and which we have invested in very substantially. We put that program back in place. This year we will fix another 400 crash sites across Australia. In fact, since 1996 we have fixed no fewer than 1,500. We have been getting on with the job. The ALP still labours away, and the best it can do is to say that it is looking closely at the issue of road funding.</DOC>

 - Section 75AU of the Trade Practices Act is explicit about price exploitation. The ACCC chairman has said on numerous occasions that he cannot see an instance where a price should increase by more than 10 per cent as a result of the GST. Whatever construction the shadow Assistant Treasurer might want to place on words, the bottom line is that this government has put in place the most significant price monitoring regime ever undertaken in the transition to a new tax system and the words in section 75AU of the Trade Practices Act are explicit about price exploitation.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise that many members of this House on both sides have expressed very great concern about the current situation in Zimbabwe. I think it is fair to say that Australia comes to this issue from a position of real strength because there is no doubt that the Australian government of the day provided very significant assistance to help Zimbabwe achieve the constitutional government, the rule of law and a civil society sought for many years before 1980. It therefore is a matter of particular concern to the Australian government that the situation in Zimbabwe today is so serious. Farmers, farm workers and members of the opposition continue to be killed and assaulted. The latest estimate I have is that 19 people have been killed. New occupations of farms are occurring. There are currently over 700 farms which have encamped squatters. The Zimbabwean government is not enforcing the decisions of Zimbabwe's High Court, nor is it attempting to control the violence and restore the rule of law. Such developments are of real concern to the Australian government and, I think it is fair to say, to this House as a whole and, of course, to the broader Australian community. The government's views have been made very clear directly to Zimbabwean ministers through our High Commission in Harare. Indeed, this very day I spoke to the Zimbabwean High Commissioner here in Canberra once more expressing my concerns about recent developments.  Last week I was in London for my first meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group prepared a strong chairman's statement, reflecting the deep concern of the Commonwealth about the situation in Zimbabwe, including - and I quote from the statement - `ongoing violence, loss of life, illegal occupations of property, failure to uphold the rule of law and political intimidation in the run-up to Zimbabwe's parliamentary election'. What was interesting about this statement was that it was a statement agreed to by not only Australia or the United Kingdom but also countries like Botswana, Nigeria - near neighbours of Zimbabwe - Malaysia, Bangladesh, Barbados and Canada. This issue is of very major concern to the international community. Let me make it clear that this problem in Zimbabwe should not be characterised just as a dispute between Zimbabwe and Britain. This is a matter of concern to the whole of the international community. We helped now President Mugabe and his people achieve the genuine independence that they have, and we expect that Zimbabwe today and the Zimbabwe government will uphold the rule of law and will ensure that there is a proper con-stitutional process in place. We will continue to make representations on this issue. The Secretary-General of the Com-monwealth is intending to visit Zimbabwe very soon and I know he will make rep-resentations. Finally, I have made it clear that Australia would be prepared to send observers to the elections in Zimbabwe which we expect to be held before the end of August. I think some members of this House may be willing to go. I think it would be appropriate to have a small number of members of parliament as part of that observer group. Overall, I think it is important that the Commonwealth has a team of observers there, including some from Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and acknowledge that his particular electorate exports hundreds of millions of dollars worth of produce and products to East Asia. I can report to the House that Australia's trade relations with Asia are in excellent shape and that Australia is deeply engaged in extending our economic ties in East Asia, quite contrary to some of the media reports that you read these days. Last week the statistics that were released for March in the year 2000 indicated that exports to East Asia were up 27 per cent on the same month in 1999. This was the eighth consecutive month of year-on-year improvement that we have seen in our export effort into East Asia. In March exports to Japan, our largest trading partner, grew by 26 per cent and a significant proportion of that were products like tuna from the member for Grey's electorate. Over $100 million worth of that particular product is exported out of his electorate to Japan. But it was not just Japan. Korea, our third largest trading partner, was up 22 per cent on last year, China was up 40 per cent and South-East Asia was up 34 per cent on last year - all good strong figures and a strong indication as far as Australia's exports are concerned. Out of that South-East Asian figure, 50 per cent of that growth was in Singapore alone, and that has taken place in the last 12 months. At the beginning of 1999, our exports of chilled pork, for instance, were negligible to Singapore; now they are counted in the tens of millions of dollars, with some 2,000 tonnes per month, I think, of chilled Australian pork going into that Singaporean market. Of the 1.7 million Australian jobs that rely on exports, over 750,000 of those rely on exports to East Asia. It is a very, very important market to Australia's exporters. On the policy front our government is continuing to shape our regional trading environment with a range of initiatives, particularly at the bilateral level and at the regional level through groupings such as APEC. We are hosting the APEC ministerial meeting in the first week in June in Darwin and we will have trade ministers or ministers responsible for trade from all those East Asian economies participating in that meeting. APEC represents over 60 per cent of the world's economy and Australia is obviously engaged at the centre of that. This will provide an opportunity to rebuild the momentum which was lost last year in Seattle to the launch of a new round of the multilateral system. There are other initiatives along with the regional and the bilateral ones that we are working on. I instance the discussions that we are having with the ASEAN countries - between Australia and New Zealand and the ASEAN countries - in looking at the prospects of a free trade agreement. My predecessor the member for Farrer, Tim Fischer, represents our government on a task force that had its second meeting recently to discuss this initiative, and ministers from the ASEAN group and from Australia and New Zealand will be making a decision on this initiative at our meeting in October this year. It all points to the fact that we remain strongly engaged in the region and are looking at strengthening our trading ties within the region.Next week I will be leading a trade mission to China which already has over 60 businessmen and businesswomen committed to travelling with me into that all-important marketplace that is going to become vitally important for Australia's exporters as they move to become members of the WTO. This trade delegation will showcase the diverse base of Australian exports and the economic expertise that we have in Australia. The Chinese are already aware of that. We have a large business relationship with China, but the prospects of significant improvement are enormous.Whilst our government is undertaking all these initiatives, it is worth asking the question of what the Labor Party is doing. Like in all other policy areas, the Labor Party is bound hand and foot to the union movement in the area of trade policy when you see leaders of the union movement like Doug Cameron reasserting himself and his union and the influence that they have over policy in the Labor Party in talking up the linkage between labour standards and trade and wanting to inject poor labour standards into the centre of trade negotiations. Whilst Doug Cameron was here in Australia talking up those issues, the shadow spokesman was traipsing around Europe for five weeks talking to his social democrat mates over there and getting a few hints and, I understand, in one press release whilst he was over there was announcing Labor policy in Europe.Finally, it is important to note that underpinning our trade strategy for Australia's exporters is the government's good economic management of the Australian economy providing a sound base off which our exporters can launch themselves into the international marketplace. Tonight's budget will add to that sound base off which they work. The new taxation system that will be introduced on 1 July will see $3½ billion worth of costs removed from Australia's exporters and under the business tax review reforms exporters will become more competitive as they move to a 30 per cent taxation rate - all measures and all initiatives that were never undertaken by the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - The opposition has made some spurious allegations in relation to this matter. In fact, Treasury, which has a Consumer Affairs Division within it, was to provide me with a departmental liaison officer. It went through a proper selection process and I understand had a number of nominees. One of the staff in my electorate office who in fact has a law degree and had experience that satisfied Treasury in relation to consumer affairs was awarded the job by Treasury and placed in my office.When it comes to the Labor Party setting down a precondition that the only people who can work in the Australian Public Service are in fact former public servants, then you start to get the sort of activity across the frontbench where only people with former union affiliations, where only staff who have formerly been employed by the union movement can work in the Australian Public Service. I find the action reprehensible and outrageous.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her continuing representations on behalf of many people, including, for instance, those in the adjoining shire of Eden-Monaro which she also chose quite properly to mention. That member never gives up representing the interests of workers in that region. Within the region mentioned by the member is included the Eurobodalla shire, which currently has an unemployment rate of approximately 22 per cent. We have just seen the Premier of New South Wales, contrary to all the scientific advice available to him from his own departmental officials and the advice available to the Commonwealth government through the appropriate activities of the regional forest agreement process, once again acting unilaterally in an area where previously his government had cut wood supply by 35 per cent. We see him stepping in, ignoring good advice and ignoring, as I understand it, even the views of some of his ministers. We see him sounding the death knell of the southern region and its wood supply and turning his back on probably loyal Labor voters who work in that industry either directly or indirectly. It leads us to another Labor Party myth. The first myth we had was the l-a-w tax cuts myth. The second one is the L-a-b-o-r myth. Labor is still being represented as a party which has something to do for, and some interest remaining in, the welfare of workers. When these actions are taken, quite clearly it is taken by the intelligentsia, which in the case of the Leader of the Opposition is more interested in the western suburbs of Perth than in the western suburbs of Sydney. We now see again the Premier of New South Wales acting in a determined fashion to kill the job opportunities of people living south of Sydney who are in a region well known as one where it is extremely difficult to get a job and, if you lose it, as one where it is even worse trying to get another. I am asked: can the Commonwealth government sign the proposals put forward by Premier Carr? We cannot. They are not consistent with scientific advice. They are not consistent with the rules of the National Forest Policy Statement written by the Labor government in 1992. And, what is more, it is very doubtful whether the remaining areas of forest that the Premier has identified for harvesting could even meet the reduced wood quotas of 42,000 cubic metres per annum that he has identified. In other words, it is a proposal to rape a section of the forest arguably to protect another bit. That is not sensible, and it has not been recommended. Finally, I want to know where the much touted members of the New South Wales Country Labor faction are. They get out there and announce themselves - old Harry, for example, and a few others. We remember Harry here. He is like the member for Bass: notable for his inactivity. The reality is that these people have not said a word to protect the industries of their own regions, despite being elected by the local people. It takes the member for Gilmore and the member for Eden-Monaro to come out and do something. I am still waiting for one communication - other than the one I have received from Mr O'Keefe, the member for Burke - from the Labor Party saying, `When are you going to do something to help working people get a job in the forest industry?' Constantly, the Premier of New South Wales makes it impossible for the Commonwealth to help.</DOC>

 - Firstly, the answer to the last part of the question is no. In fact, I cannot think of anything more ludicrous than to suggest that the government would set about deliberately to cripple one of its own government business enterprises. - In relation to the other part of the question in respect of the ongoing contracts that Employment National had, the government did obtain an analysis from the senior management through the then board and from independent analysts, and it was very clear that if we had proceeded to accept and execute those contracts and proceed with it we would have exposed the company to potential losses of between $10 million and $14 million. If the honourable member, before putting out a press release last week on this issue, had bothered to read the answers to the questions on notice given to the honourable member for Melbourne, then that might have been clear to her. - She says she did. Clearly she did not, because she proceeded to make a statement and to ask that question. I can only allow others to deduce just what her capacity is to understand some of these issues. Employment National was part of the Job Network 1 process. It contributed significantly to its success. Job Network 2 will in fact deliver even greater success to unemployed workers throughout Australia. - There was a competitive tendering process and through that competitive tendering process a number of contracts were allocated. Sadly, Employment National did not succeed. In fact, from having something like $286 million worth of work, it was awarded tenders of something around $40 million. It agreed to the specifications and the criteria for those tenders. It assured me that it had undertaken competitive tenders. The outcome of a very specific and very well-run tender process turned out to be otherwise. The government, of course, then took appropriate steps: (1) to protect as best we could the employees of Employment National and (2) to ensure that there was to be the minimum of impact on the budget in respect of maintaining that company. But the government did decide to keep that company going. It did indicate that it will stand behind it and it is certainly very proud of the success that we have had in the Job Network programs. For those job seekers in Australia who need support, this government has ensured that they have got better support than they ever did when Labor had responsibility for these areas. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest. Diabetes affects some 700,000 to 800,000 Australians. The overwhelming majority have what is called type 2 diabetes, which affects adults later in life and can be treated with medication, diet and exercise. Around 100,000 Australians need insulin to control their diabetes. The majority of these people contract it in childhood, and it is called type 1 diabetes. Currently there are some 7,000 Australian children with type 1 diabetes and about 400 children a year newly develop type 1 diabetes. For the last six months the Commonwealth has been in negotiation with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International about the possibility of Australia being a focus of JDFI's major international research effort to find a vaccine for juvenile diabetes. Some years ago this would have been thought to be an impossible dream, but with further understanding in receptor chemistry and the nature of rotavirus in involvement in developing diabetes there is a real possibility that Australia could actually develop a vaccine for diabetes. JDFI are a major research funder around the world, this year putting some $US85 million into research projects. They stated to me that they thought Australia was finally serious about biomedical science and they were prepared to look to us, and so together we were able to announce some $32.5 million of funding for immunological research to try and develop a vaccine for diabetes. JDFI have done an extraordinarily good job in this. They are the leaders in the world in funding biomedical research from the non-government sector. It is incredibly heartening to see such a worthwhile project addressing a very substantial community need while also displaying the vision of developing Australia's science and technology based growth.</DOC>

There has been a longstanding arrangement whereby Australian made vehicles should be leased by the Australian Public Service where these vehicles are available. As there is not a full range of vehicles made locally -  -  - Imported vehicles which have an engine capacity below that of the smallest Australian made vehicle are available under the Executive Vehicle Scheme guidelines. These guidelines were revised in April to reflect changes in the range of Australian made vehicles and to provide further preference towards the domestic motor vehicle industry. The revised guidelines provide that only those imported vehicles produced by manufacturers eligible for registration as a motor vehicle or automotive component producer under the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme Administration Act 1999 - that is, Holden, Ford, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Nissan - are available under the EVS. This is subject to the imported vehicle having an engine capacity of 2,000 cubic centimetres or less, which is about 10 per cent less than that of any Australian made passenger motor vehicle. Prior to these recent changes, Mr Speaker, any imported vehicle with an engine capacity of 1,500 cubic centimetres or less was available under the EVS. So the guidelines have been changed in a way which is particularly positive for Australian manufacturers. Under the guidelines, agency heads are responsible for developing and administering vehicle policy in their agency, subject to the requirement of the guidelines. While the list of eligible vehicles includes a range of different cars, I would expect agency heads to be sensitive to the perceptions of the public when approving certain cars, particularly sports cars, as well as to the practicality of such vehicles for work related purposes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I was pleased to see reports this year of record attendances at the Anzac Day commemorative services around Australia, not only in our capital cities but also in our many country towns and provincial cities. In response to the increased interest from Australians of all ages in attending the dawn service at the Gallipoli Peninsula, this government made a commitment to establish a new site on the Gallipoli Peninsula for the conduct of those dawn services. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that this year saw the first dawn service conducted at that new Anzac commemorative site. It was, I believe, a very solemn and a very fitting service to honour the 8,700 young Australians who never returned and never saw their families again. I had the privilege to join our Australian Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister, who jointly opened, during the dawn service, the new Anzac commemorative site, which has been constructed on the shoreline of North Beach, on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The Leader of the Opposition was invited by the government to attend, and I do thank him for his attendance at that dawn service and, in fact, at the services throughout the day. Mr Speaker, I also want to place on the record the government's appreciation to the Turkish government and the local officials in the area for their cooperation in allowing us to establish this new site. It obviously means a great deal to all Australians to be able to attend a dawn service at Gallipoli because, as we witnessed on the day at Gallipoli, young Australians particularly are seeking out the birthplace of the Anzac legend. In their own private way they are probably trying to relate to the events of 85 years ago and are wanting to know more about how it has established our own Australian national identity.This year's service at the Gallipoli Peninsula, the 85th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli, saw a record crowd in attendance. The crowds have been estimated at anywhere up to 15,000 people and I know the official count of buses that were bringing people in exceeded 270. The crowd was made up of Australians and New Zealanders, dominated by young people; but there were people of all ages there in a pilgrimage to the Anzac commemorative site. I also want to mention of the conduct of young Australians of all ages and from all walks of life as they walked around the Gallipoli Peninsula through the war graves the day before and also during the morning of the services. I think they were there, in their own quiet way, as great ambassadors for Australia. They represented us extremely well and, I must say, I felt extremely proud of the younger generations of Australians who had made that pilgrimage to be there on Anzac Day. I think we can all take great heart that Anzac Day as a national day of commemoration, and the Anzac legend and spirit, are seen by young Australians as their possession forever. The new site will cater for Anzac Day dawn services for generations to come and I think all of us who had the privilege of being there, including our Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, will confirm that it is a magnificent site and one that will serve this country for generations to come. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I frankly do not know. I will find out. I thank -  - I do not know and, as you know, I do not automatically accept everything that comes from the other side. But I will check and if there is anything that I can usefully inform the honourable member for Grayndler of regarding the matter I certainly will, and I will make that known to other honourable members.Mr Speaker, while I am on my feet, I have been informed by a reliable source that that was question 1,003 asked by the opposition since the return of the coalition government in October of the year before last. If my quick mathematics serve me well, it has taken us only -  - The point I was making was simply that on the rate of progress of previous governments we really would not have any more questions for the rest of the government's term.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. Honourable members will be aware of the tremendous popularity amongst employers of the government's New Apprenticeships system. Indeed, the number of young people on apprenticeships and traineeships has virtually doubled since this government came to office, and that is a measure of how industry has welcomed the government's reforms. Recently I hosted the inaugural National Industry Skills Forum, which is a Commonwealth initiative designed to work with industry partners to expand skills training in three traditional trade areas. It is quite clear that, for Australia to be internationally competitive, business has got to have access to high levels of skills in the trade areas. At that industry forum, the government received some remarkable endorsements from Australia's major industry bodies, and I know members of the House will want to hear these endorsements.David Buckingham, the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia, said that the review of skilling in the traditional trades had revealed `strong industry support for the overall thrust of the training reform agenda, including the greater flexibilities and choices provided by it.' Bob Herbert, Chief Executive of AIG, said that there were some very sound fundamentals in our current system. He went on to say that he believed very strongly that the most important ingredients are flexibility and choice. These are certainly offered within this national framework. Mark Paterson, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the review had highlighted very strong business support for the trading reforms across the full agenda. So here we have the three major industry bodies in Australia representing large and small business giving their overwhelming endorsement to the government's training reforms.  These reforms are a massive advance over the trading policies of the previous government. We know that the Labor Party has absolutely no policy in this area - no skills policy. We are beginning to see the usual annual distortions of government policy coming from the opposition in the lead-up to the budget. The member for Dobell, pathetically copied by the member for Dickson, put out a press release saying that this government had cut $240 million out of TAFE. Of course, this is absolutely wrong; it is one of many, many distortions - untruths - that the opposition is beginning to crank out, trying to distort the government's policies. The truth is that the government has maintained funding for TAFE in real terms and, indeed, through greater efficiencies, has managed to provide 160,000 additional places in TAFE over the last three years of the ANTA agreement. This contrasts with the opposition, which is full of distortions and untruths as we approach the budget, with a government that is moving ahead constructively with the policy process. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister for education, had the training area ripped away from him by Paul Keating, who walked right over him and put into place the government -  - Paul Keating did. - Paul Keating did. You did not do anything. You did not take any initiative, because you have no interest in the area. You have never had any interest in the area. As your biography says -  - The Leader of the Opposition made it clear when he was Minister for Education and Training that there was no portfolio in which he thought there was so little to do. - We have the weakest frontbench that Australia has seen for decades, and it is this government, as you will see tonight in the budget, that is going to be leading Australia into the future with firm and confident policies. </DOC>

 - The question was I think: why didn't you show a structural deficit in your budget papers last night? The reason is that it is a structural surplus. You cannot show a structural deficit in these budget papers - a point which I thought was rather eloquently made in Budget Paper No. 1, part 4, Fiscal Strategy, which no doubt you have read in great detail. As the government which introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, the government complies with it in totality.  - I hear interjections from the member for Hotham on the Charter of Budget Honesty. The funny thing is that, when we were elected in March 1996 and I went looking for the Labor Party's charter of budget honesty, it could not be found. There was no charter of budget honesty. A charter of budget honesty was enacted in this country for one reason and one reason only: to ensure that the kind of deceit and deception which was practised by the Labor Party in its 1994-95 and 1995-96 budgets was never repeated. The infamous claim by the then Minister for Finance that a budget which was $10 billion in deficit on an underlying basis - an outcome which came out three months after the election - was a surplus led to the enactment of the Charter of Budget Honesty, put in place, as always, by this government, complied with by this government, to put aside the kind of deceit that the Labor Party used to practise. This latest tactic of the Labor Party to somehow claim that the government is as bad as the Labor Party was we take as quite a serious allegation against us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. This financial year, 2000-01, for the fourth time in a row the coalition budgets for a surplus. In the financial year 1999-2000, which will be completed on 30 June, it is estimated that the outcome - not the budget - will be a surplus of $7.8 billion. By running the budget in surplus, the coalition has been able to repay Labor debt. There is no way that this change in the budget is better illustrated than by the following fact, which I would recount to all members of the House.In the last five budgets of the Labor Party, after paying for all of their expenses from all of their sources of revenue, their deficits were such that they needed to borrow $80,000 million. After paying their expenses they had to borrow $80,000 million. The coalition this year brought down its fifth budget and, after paying for its expenses and getting the budget in surplus, it will repay $50,000 million of Labor debt. With Labor after five budgets, debt went up $80 billion; with the coalition after five budgets, it not only has kept the budget in surplus but has repaid $50 billion of Labor debt. We are five-eighths of the way there in relation to Labor debt.  I heard some of the Labor Party saying this morning, `Oh, they have only repaid $50 billion of our debt. They should be repaying more. They should be repaying more than $50 billion of our $80 billion worth of debt so that we, the Labor Party, could hope to get into government and have our debts repaid and take advantage of it.' These complaints by the Labor Party, `You should be repaying more of our debt,' are like Ned Kelly going round, robbing the bank at Jerilderie and saying, `There wasn't enough money in the vault.' This is the Labor Party: `We want to get into office and you have not repaid enough of our debt.' We have repaid $50 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt, and nothing could more illustrate the difference between a Labor government and a coalition government: a Labor government in five budgets ran up $80 billion worth of debt; the coalition in five budgets paid off $50 billion of it. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I certainly do stand behind the statements that we have made in relation to the benefits of the government's income tax package. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the opportunity of explaining how, under our proposal, bracket creep is a lot less than it is under your rate scales. It is a lot less. To start with, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. As a result of the introduction of the new taxation system, it will be possible for an Australian employee to move from $20,000 a year to $50,000 a year without suffering any increase at all in any income tax rate on any proportion of that person's income. This represents an unprecedented flattening of the income tax scales in this country. It introduces far more equity into the income taxation system.The other point to make about bracket creep, to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, is that, when the rate of inflation is lower, the impact of bracket creep is less. The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have been running around the airwaves this morning talking about the spike in the inflation rate that is going to occur in the September quarter as a result of the introduction of the GST. I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition - oh, the $80 billion man is on his feet again. - The point that I was making, before being interrupted with an utterly irrelevant point of order, was that one of the things that bears upon the extent of bracket creep is, of course, the rate of inflation. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around talking about the increase in the CPI in the September quarter of this year. That increase, which of course will be reflected on one occasion only and will recede in subsequent quarters, was the average of inflation under the years that the Labor Party were in government. Our spike was their average. Through the years that they were in government they had an inflation average of what it is now predicted it will be on a once-only basis as a result of the introduction of the goods and services tax.  The Leader of the Opposition asked me about some of the reasons for increased income tax collections. One of the reasons why we have increased income tax collections is that we have more taxpayers. And we have more taxpayers because we have more people in work. One of the distinguishing features of this government is that we have added 653,000 Australians to the job list of this country as a result of the policies of this government, and most particularly our policy of reducing debt. Never let it be forgotten that, when that man was in charge, in five years that government ran up $80 billion of debt - and in just five years, under the stewardship of this government, we will have repaid $50 billion of that $80 billion of debt. Whenever the Labor Party talk about budgets and whenever we hear a lecture on fiscal rectitude from the Labor Party, it is like hearing a lecture on corporate propriety from Christopher Skase! When we hear a lecture from them on fiscal propriety, I will remind them, and every one of my colleagues will remind them, that in five years they ran up $80 billion of debt. You left this country in hock. You stopped every attempt we made in our first, second and third budgets to claw back the position. It will always be the proud boast of this government that, having inherited that $80 billion of debt, run up in only five budgets - that is a phenomenal performance; you have to be really great financial geniuses; you could understand it in 10 budgets; you could understand it in 20 budgets; but five budgets! - we have paid back $50 billion. And it will be ever to the credit of this government that, despite the obstruction of the Labor Party, despite the legacy and the mess they left us, despite all of their attempts in the Senate to stop us getting it right, we have put the books back into balance, we have got this country out of hock, and that is why the international community and the Australian people admire and respect the economic management of this government under this Treasurer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. I was astounded to hear the  claim being made on radio this morning by none other than the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that income tax cuts would be clawed back. At first I thought the Leader of the Opposition was announcing a tax policy; that he would be increasing the rate of income tax if he ever got elected. But no, although income tax rates are being reduced - 20 per cent is coming down to 17 per cent and the 43 per cent rate is coming down to 30 per cent, and staying there - the allegation is being made by the Labor Party that somehow, although the income tax rate is permanently lowered, people will lose the value of that particular income tax cut. It took me back to the last time Australians were promised income tax cuts, which was before the 1993 election. Did I say they were promised income tax cuts? No, they were l-a-w. The kind of income tax cut that the Labor Party produce is one that is in law before an election and mysteriously disappears out of law after an election. These are real income tax cuts which are legislated and will come into force in 52 days time. - The member for Hotham says `and then disappear'. What he says is that, as revenue from income tax increases, that must mean that somehow the tax cuts disappear. But, as the Prime Minister has said, one of the reasons why income tax receipts increase across the forward estimates is that more people go into work - a point which has apparently completely eluded the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. More people get higher wages - another point that has apparently eluded the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The variables that will be changing are higher real wages and more people in work, and that is one of the benefits of good policy. But, if the Labor Party had their way and there were no income tax cuts - none whatsoever - not only would individuals be paying higher income tax but, of course, government revenues would boom. On Thursday night, when he gives his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition is going to announce his roll-back. He is going to name the goods and services on which he intends to roll back the goods and services tax - the tax that he is so opposed to that, if he ever gets elected, he wants to keep. When he gets up on Thursday night, he is (1) going to announce where his roll-back is coming from, (2) going to announce how he would fund, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is calling for, more spending on education, science, infrastructure, regional development, jobs, industry and public hospitals, (4) going to announce how he will have a bigger surplus, because he is apparently in favour of a bigger surplus, and (5) going to announce how he is in favour of income tax cuts which should not grow out in the forward estimates. He will roll back in relation to the GST; roll up spending; roll out the barrel to the interest groups; roll over to the unions - and put together a whole lot of mutually inconsistent promises which he knows and we know cannot be delivered on. But we wait with interest. I am told by his speech writers that he is going to name the roll-back on Thursday night; he is going to name all of those areas where the Australian Labor Party are going to roll back the GST that they are so opposed to. And we wait with bated breath. </DOC>

 - As I have made entirely clear, the government do not target a particular exchange rate - a policy which, as I recall, was introduced by the Australian Labor Party with the support of the coalition. For that reason we do not say a particular rate which we would expect the currency to go to, but we do say that we think it important to run strong fundamentals in economic policy. - I hear the Leader of the Opposition say that we are not doing that: we are not running strong economic policy. I suppose we should follow his example: we should have unemployment at 11.3 per cent; we should have the budget in deficit by $17 billion; we should have inflation at the rate of the Labor Party average in the 1980s of eight per cent; and we should be running up $50 billion worth of debt. We think it is important to run a strong economy in Australia. We think it is important to have good growth, low inflation, a good budget position. Those are the fundamentals that we focus on. Our interest rates on home loan mortgages - even though they are 7½, 7.8 per cent outside of the last year - are still the lowest home mortgage variable rates since 1973. They are lower than at any period in 13 years of Labor Party government. If you went through the 13 years of Hawke-Keating government, although you would find home mortgage variable rates at 17 per cent on some occasions, you would not find them in the seven per cents. That is another reason why -   - You would not find the number seven in front of it, but you would find the number 17 in front of it during the 1980s. The government intends to keep running a strong economic policy. That is why we reformed the tax system. I said last night in the budget and I say it again: there are some that pretend that reform is not necessary, and there are some that are even worse; they want to oppose reform whilst hoping one day to take the benefits of it. As I said last night, you cannot take the results if you will not do the work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I remind the House of the concluding words of the Treasurer's budget speech last night when he said that it was a document that brought together the economic as well as the social goals of the government. The message out of last night's budget is that there is a dividend for the Australian people as a result of responsible economic management. What we are able to say to the Australian people is that we inherited an $80 billion debt, run up in only five years by the former government, and in five budgets we have cut $50 billion out of that $80 billion debt. We have reduced the level of inflation. We have delivered lower interest rates. We have generated 653,000 more jobs. We have undertaken further major economic reforms. We are introducing, on 1 July this year, the largest single economic change for the better that this country has had since the end of World War II. Everybody who knows anything about Australian politics knows that for the last 30 years the one great economic reform that both sides of politics accepted was necessary was fundamental reform of our taxation system. Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke knew that. In his days as Treasurer, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating knew that. It was supported by the current Leader of the Opposition when he was a member of the Hawke government. It is something that I have advocated for many years. But only one government in the last 25 years has had the courage to introduce that reform.We have the spectacle opposite of a group of people who leave behind an economic mess - who run up $80 billion in five budgets - and then at every turn they set about trying to obstruct and prevent the newly elected government from introducing the reform measures. But, despite that, we have been able to reduce that debt by $50 billion in only five budgets. We are able to talk of lower interest rates, of more jobs and of tax reform. Last night I was very proud to hear the Treasurer announce the biggest ever assault by any government in Australia on the greatest area of rural disadvantage in this country, and that is inadequate health services. That particular reform, which has, quite rightly, won very significant acclaim within rural Australia, will be supported by every Australian, whether they live in the country or in the city, because it is the unarguable right of every Australian citizen to have access to competent and affordable health services. That has been the cornerstone of our approach.Therefore, I can say to the member for Forde that good economic management has a great social dividend. That social dividend is lower debt for the nation, $50 billion of lower debt in only five budgets. It means lower interest rates - to the tune, even after the recent increases, of $220 a month less than was the case in March 1996. It means increases in real wages because nominal income growth has gone ahead of the rate of inflation. It means lower levels of inflation. It means 653,000 more jobs. It means generational change in the tax system. It means fundamental reform of the way we operate the labour market exchange system in this country, whereby Job Network is delivering infinitely better outcomes than were delivered under the old CES. It means a record number of apprenticeships and traineeships. `Apprenticeship' became a dirty word under Labor. We have resurrected the place and the respectability of apprenticeships. It means that private health insurance is again enjoying the support of middle Australia. It is returning to high levels. It means increased provision for public hospitals because we have increased the money going to public hospitals in Australia. On top of that, with the introduction of the goods and services tax, every last dollar of it will go to the state governments of Australia. They will have more money for police, more money for government schools and more money for public hospitals. So I say to the member for Forde that yes, there is a great social dividend. There is a social dividend for the entire nation; there is a social dividend for the families of Australia; there is a dividend for all of us in responsible economic management - and there is a message in that for those who miserably sit opposite.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. As a result of the reforms that we are introducing, Australians will enjoy lower income tax; Australians will enjoy a superior indirect tax system; rural Australians will enjoy lower fuel prices; Australian business will enjoy a lower company tax rate. This crowd opposite want to stop us reforming the Australian taxation system. The Leader of the Opposition gets up and says, `It's a $30 billion tax slug so I'm going to keep it.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition says. He walks both sides of the street on every issue. He did it again last night on the budget. He gets up and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and they both fulminate with outrage: `It's a phoney surplus,' they say, `but it's so phoney that we want to add to it.' They get up and they say, `It's a phoney surplus.' They say that the surplus is not really there. But, in the next breath - forget that statement - `We want to spend more money on this; we want to spend more money on some other program.' No doubt on Thursday night, as well as talking about where he is going to roll it back, the Leader of the Opposition is going to list all the additional expenditure of a Beazley Labor government. And of course he is going to tell us how he is going to fund that. In the same breath he is going to tell us how he is going to shore up this allegedly phoney surplus. That is not walking both sides of the street: it is walking both sides of the street and the middle all at the same time - a remarkable achievement.Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that the taxation reform that this government had the courage to introduce, a taxation reform that we took to the Australian people, a taxation reform that was laid out in detail to the Australian people, a taxation reform for which we had a mandate, and the detail, the openness and the transparency of that program, have been without parallel in the political history of Australia. It is now only 54 days before that will be introduced -  - Fifty-two. Time passes when you are having fun. There are only 52 days before it is introduced, and I predict now that the Australian people, a few weeks after its introduction, will look back with contempt at the obstruction tactics of the Australian Labor Party. They will remember that it was the coalition that had the courage to do the right thing, that it was the coalition that had the courage to do what was good for Australia, and that it was the Labor Party that not only ran up $80 billion of debt in five budgets but set about, from the moment the member for Brand became the Leader of the Opposition, obstructing, delaying and trying to frustrate the desire and the authority of this government to take good decisions in the long-term interests of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question; a very good one it is. Last night the Treasurer announced a major investment in this country in what can best be described as the social infrastructure of rural and regional Australia - a very welcome investment over and above the benefits that flow from sound economic management, the benefits that clearly reflect sound discipline in fiscal management, a discipline that the ALP were not able to apply in government and plainly would be unable to apply if, per misfortune, they were ever able to fall back into government.The first point I want to make is that, in some of the rhetoric we have heard in the last couple of days, there is one thing that can be taken absolutely for certain - country people see through your confected concern for rural and regional Australia. They know your track record and they know you never change. The ALP had 13 years to make a difference in rural and regional Australia and, of course, the fact of the matter is that Labor did. They did not miss. And country people are still counting the cost. I went back through some figures that I did a few years ago to illustrate the unbelievable relative cost of your interest rate regime for our farmers and our small businesses. While I was looking at that, we just did a bit of work, and in 1983 indicative interest rates in this country were around 15 per cent, but for our competitors in America - whether a farmer or small business or whatever - they were about 8½. By 1990 in this country, the base rate, if you were a really good borrower, was about 18.25 per cent. Do you know what it was in the US? It was a fraction over eight per cent. In this country, under the stewardship of this government, by February of this year the commercial interest rate could be fairly said to be about 8.25 per cent while in the US it was 8.73. If that is not a story of sound economic management that is of enormous benefit not just to the broader economy but to rural and regional Australia, then I do not know what is. It is that discipline, that winding back of the debt which had arisen from the $80 billion over and above the $16 billion that was already there, that we are now able to point to as being wound back by $50 billion by the end of this financial year. Those sorts of savings give us the flexibility to move.Last night's package - a very major investment in the social infrastructure of rural and regional Australia - is worth running over. It has been alluded to by the Prime Minister and by others - $562 million to really address rural and regional health. I sincerely thank the minister for health for his hard work in putting it together. In a couple moments - I am sure it will not embarrass him - I might even be tempted to record some of the positive remarks that have been made around the country in relation to it. Then, of course, there are two measures that are incredibly widely welcomed today, as we have seen, particularly in remote areas. They relate to the greater assistance under the isolated children's scheme for people in remote areas, many of whom, as we know, are facing real difficulties in meeting their children's educational needs. There is better access to the youth allowance with the discounting of farm and small business assets. There is digital television ensuring that Australia is not left behind in the roll-out. There is, of course, the $306 million boost to Agriculture Advancing Australia, which is a package that took the place of a much inferior and much smaller package - the old RAS under the ALP - and substantially increased funding for such valuable programs as Farm Family Restart and for FarmBis. There is a $500 million contribution towards petrol pricing in rural and regional Australia. These are over and above the sorts of initiatives that we have already seen put in place such as the Rural Transaction Centres, the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal and the Stronger Families and Communities. The endorsements, I think, are worth referring to briefly. The National Rural Health Alliance has warmly welcomed the range of new initiatives. David Brand from the AMA said:Major expenditure on rural health could not be more welcome.Barry Hailstone in the Advertiser made this interesting comment:It is the biggest boost to the health of people living in rural and remote areas since the advent of the Flying Doctor.Dr Arn Sprogis, the spokesman for the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, said:This is the first time in living memory that a government has made a serious attempt to rectify the 30 year drain on rural communities in the health sector.Megan McNicholl, who had a great input into the summit, summed it up this way:This is a very positive budget. Many families will welcome the government's commitment to ensuring that students from regional and remote Australia have improved access to education and training and the ICPA has also welcomed the Prime Minister's pre-budget Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. They commend the flexible support that will available through this initiative.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. As I said -  - Do you want to know which page? - Page 1-28. I will read it to you: ... a substantial part of the forecast 2000-01 projected out-year surpluses would be structural.I would have thought it was pretty obvious. You asked the question: `What page?' and I read it out to you. Let me come to this question because we get really interested in the Labor Party, which is now interested in surpluses. First of all, we put the budget into surplus on a headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, `We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis,' which the Labor Party never did. And then we said, `We ought to move to accrual accounting and put it into a surplus on an operating basis,' which the Labor Party never did. So then they thought up a fourth definition to try and sort of find a fourth way of actually trying accounting which would somehow try and prove that there was a deficit which they failed on, in addition. This is the Labor Party which wants to (1) roll back GST; (2) increase spending; (3) increase surpluses, with a track record of an $80 billion debt. The Labor Party lecturing the government on surpluses! The captain of the Titanic giving lectures on boat safety! That is what it is: the captain of the Titanic giving lectures on boat safety.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for his question. Paying off your debt means you do not have to pay as much interest, and it means that you have more money to spend on things such as health. Rural health is the big winner from last night's budget. But this is not the first time we have made initiatives in rural health. We are building on the successes of the past four years, with our university departments of rural health, the John Flynn scholarships, the rural retention payments and the multipurpose centres in regional communities. The initiatives fall broadly into two areas: more doctors, and better services. There will be an increased number of doctors in rural Australia from the beginning of next year, with more training places in the general practice training program. We will be increasing the training program from 400 to 450 doctors, but 225 - or half of them - will be regionalised and wholly located within rural Australia for the first time. In addition, young doctors taking up these training positions will get financial incentives to train in the country. Secondly, we are providing three types of assistance for people who wish to practise in rural areas or who come from rural areas. The RAMUS scheme scholarships recognise the fact that kids from the country going to med school have greater costs than kids from the city - quite simply, they just cannot live at home. We will be doubling the number of RAMUS scheme scholarships from next year, and there will be 400 scholarships available across the years of medicine. - For the first time ever, we will be allowing young doctors to work off their HECS debts by practising in a rural location. Thirdly, we will be providing scholarships for doctors who are prepared to commit themselves, and to have that commitment backed up by a restriction on the Medicare provider number into rural Australia. There will be 100 scholarships each and every year, and this measure will have a very substantial effect in the medium to long term. A substantial specialist outreach service will provide specialists to regional centres and will expand specialist training in rural Australia, something that has been started under this government and that we look forward to expanding very substantially. So a doctor who wants to be a surgeon and to practise in rural Australia will be able to do a wholly rural surgical training program. Finally, we have a rural training network, which I believe will change the face of medical practice.Under better services, for the first time ever we recognise that you just cannot get enough doctors in country Australia. Allied health professionals can fill many of the holes, and we will be allowing divisions of general practice to engage allied health professionals. Our regional health centre program will almost double, with another 85 communities getting regional health services. We have initiatives to retain and to recruit pharmacists into rural Australia on a scale that we have never attempted before. We have addressed the issue of small hospitals in the non-government sector, particularly the bush nursing hospitals in Victoria and the small private hospitals in Queensland. The honourable member knows about this - he is on my door every other day about the hospitals at Walwa, Chilton, Violet Town, Yackandandah, Euroa. I can say to him that everyone of those communities now has a lifeline for their small hospital. The Victorian health minister has been in the media, asking me to assist him in keeping these hospitals open. I can now say to him that I can assist him, and I will assist him. I will be writing to him in the near future and offering to work with him to ensure these hospitals stay open.While I am on my feet - it was not a budget measure, but it relates to these hospitals - I have just approved a one-off increase of 10 per cent in the amount of money they will get for nursing home type patients from health funds. This will be an immediate injection of money for these small hospitals. All in all, they are historic reforms. As I travel extensively in country Australia, I have never heard country people ask for anything other than what city people take for granted. This will mean that that is a reality.</DOC>

 - I have no difficulty in convincing the minister of that, or indeed of most things. I find him a very convincible fellow and, may I say, a very convivial fellow who is great company. I will take a stab at this, but I would suspect that he does not personally negotiate these agreements. You produce an agreement and say, `Why hasn't he negotiated a different clause?' I will take a stab at it, but I think it might be because he does not actually negotiate these agreements. I might be wrong about that - he could be down there with the unions negotiating them personally - because I know that the unions love his company. It may well be that he is down there in Melbourne negotiating them personally. Come to think of it: I would not be surprised to see the old ex-ACTU leader negotiating on behalf of the unions down there. That would not surprise me at all.Government policy is that, because taxes are being cut and family assistance is being increased and that means that people will have more disposable income, there are no grounds for second round wage claims. I think that is borne out by the fact that, for a family on $40,000 with two children, one under the age of five, the combined effect of income tax cuts and increased family assistance is $50 a week after tax. As a result of that, any price rise that occurs - some prices will go up, some will stay the same and some will come down - would be fully compensated.As we are on the subject of employee claims and union demands, I would like to ask the Australian Labor Party where it stands on the CPSU's claim - it has stopped work in the Australian Taxation Office in a bid to stop registrations of the Australian business number. As the Australian Labor Party now wants to keep the GST, I do not think it would be too happy with a union trying to sabotage registrations. But, Mr Speaker, you can look in vain at the ex-union officials sitting on the front bench of the Labor Party and expect to hear a word of condemnation over the CPSU stop-work in the Australian Taxation Office, which has the objective of preventing ABN registrations. The Labor Party now wants to keep the GST. It needs those registrations. Can it stand up to the CPSU and its campaign? For that matter, can it stand up to any trade union campaigns?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. There are quite a number of other initiatives in the budget that relate to health, not specifically to rural health. The honourable member mentioned one that I find particularly exciting and that is a very large pilot program for bowel cancer screening. I must say that I had some difficulty convincing my colleagues of the merit of providing 50,000 people each year with a sigmoidoscopy but the fact is that bowel cancer affects 10,000 people a year and 4½ thousand Australians die of it. There is growing evidence that people over the age of 50 can have bowel cancer detected early through an annual sigmoidoscopy and that it may lead to very substantially improved survival from bowel cancer. But the logistics of trying to screen a whole country for bowel cancer, as we do for breast cancer and cervical cancer, are fairly frightening. So we will be undertaking a very major pilot program over the next three years, inviting 50,000 Australians to take part and, through their general practitioner, to undertake a very large-scale screening. This will inform us for future policy development. If we can actually show that we can improve outcomes through screening for cancer of the bowel, that is something that all Australians should be very happy about. There is money for nucleic acid testing of our blood. Our blood is already very safe but it can be even safer. Nucleic acid testing started some months ago and it is now formalised in this budget. I should inform honourable members that earlier this week I received the first advice that a unit of blood that was contaminated with hepatitis C and that had tested normal on the ordinary tests for donated blood had in fact been picked up with nucleic acid testing as being hepatitis C positive, the donor being in the window period where it does not show up. Again, every Australian can think of the damage that could be done by a single unit of blood contaminated with hepatitis C or HIV, and this initiative means that is much less likely.The National Cord Blood Bank network will get to full strength over four years and will mean an additional 40 children every year with leukaemia can get a proper match for their bone marrow transplants and have a much higher chance of a cure. The initiatives in pharmacy are quite a major step forward. We are proposing from the middle of the year to change the basis on which prescriptions are given. They will be barcoded and the Medicare number will be part of the prescription. While this will be voluntary, we would expect the majority of doctors and Australians to participate. It will mean that, in real time, we can verify any contraindications, any cross-reactions with other drugs, and we can even let the doctor know by an email that the script has been filled.Finally, a very extensive training network around Australia that is going to completely change the way that medical students are trained will be established, and this will particularly affect the electorate of the member for Herbert. At the moment, most undergraduate medical training takes place in the cities by city doctors with a city focus. A kid from the country who wants to go to med school has to leave the country for 10 years to do undergraduate and postgraduate training. Not any more; we will be expanding our university departments of rural health and will be offering every medical school in Australia a clinical school, funded to the order of $3 million to $4 million per year, recurrent. These clinical schools will be in rural Australia. James Cook University, which has a medical school, which quite frankly would not be there if it were not for the member for Herbert, will be able to apply for a clinical school and have a good part of their undergraduate training outside Towns-ville. This means that probably 25 per cent of undergraduate clinical training will be in country Australia. Under these changes, a kid in year 11 or year 12 at a country high school, who is bright and has the prospect of getting into medicine, or if they are just outside the cut-off getting one of the additional places that will be made available in medical schools, will be able to take a John Flynn scholarship and go back to work in the country for every year of their undergraduate training. They will be able to do all their clinical training at an undergraduate level in country Australia and then they will be able to do all their postgraduate training in country Australia. So, rather than country Australia having perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of all training in medicine, they will have at least 50 per cent. This will change the focus and will mean that the country will get a fair deal.</DOC>

 - The budget last night introduced the Family Assistance Office review mechanism, following the announcement of 10 April 2000 of the broad parameters of the scheme, to enable people to claim a top-up payment. The expenses that are put out there are of the order of $15 million. The reason why it is a scheme of limited duration is that the example, as I recall, that the Leader of the Opposition relies upon requires somebody to actually resign from the workforce during the course of the year. The reason for that is that the test which applies in relation to family assistance - in relation to that one payment and that one payment only - is currently a fortnightly test, and as we harmonise all of the tests it goes to a yearly test. So you have to actually try to find somebody who would have been able to have a big drop in income for a particular fortnight but had a large income over the course of the year and find out why it was a rare occasion and a transitional occasion because, at the end of the year, the year clicks over and that person is still out of the workforce and under the yearly income test does not have the disqualification that comes about. As a consequence, it is a one-off transitional for a part-year only. That is why the compensation is of the order it is and the budget papers make full provision for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. The figures in the budget are very positive in terms of employment prospects over the next 12 months. In fairness, one should also say that this reflects a dividend from a lot of sensible policy reform over the last three or four years, whether it be in education, with a couple of hundred thousand apprenticeships and equipping young people to take jobs or in the Job Network and the work that has been done there to get people into work. Right across government there have been a lot of reforms. Our pro small business reforms have been encouraging small businesses to go out and give somebody a job.Based on today's numbers, with 650,000-odd jobs created since this government has been in office and an unemployment rate now the best in 10 years, as we look to the next 12 months, the figures are pretty encouraging. In fact, employment is expected to grow at a robust 2¼ per cent in the year ahead and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 6¼ per cent by the June quarter 2001. And that is whilst the participation rate is moving up. So that is a very good number and is testament, I must say, to the very good economic management of Australia and I think a great tribute to the Treasurer on the work that he has done. This is very good, practical, sensible economic management, delivering real benefits, getting people into jobs and giving us the wherewithal to help people in need, particularly in rural Australia in the health area. The IMF has said that one of the positives of economic management in recent years has been the structural reforms - and I refer to page 2.25 of the budget. It says:... structural reforms have raised Australia's sustainable productivity growth, thereby enhancing the growth potential of the economy. I suppose that is stating the obvious. It is much easier to state the obvious than it is to implement the obvious reforms necessary when, of course, we have been opposed every inch of the way by the opposition as we have tried to correct the mistakes that we inherited as a government. In the area of fiscal policy we have been able to get interest rates down. Why? Because we have been better at managing the nation's finances. What a tremendous record it is for us to have paid back $50 billion of the $80 billion that Labor racked up over their last five years. Now what do we find? As we look to the future, while the benefits of the policies we have been putting in place are flowing through to the Australian people, we find on the Labor Party side that they are cooking up all the same old policies that gave us the splurge and all the pro trade union policies that got Australia into trouble when Labor were last in office. We have my opposite number, the shadow minister, this week - not just this week, but this week was bad enough - implying that she wants to spend a billion dollars more on universities. She also wants to spend $240 million on TAFE, because she reckons we cut it, which we did not. But leaving that point aside, there is $1.24 billion. That ought to be on the list on Thursday night. Back in February she was going to expand employment services in Job Network. That was $1.8 billion. So if we add that on, now we are up to $3 billion. Then of course there are wage subsidies. The sky is the limit. So there is a lot of spending to be announced on Thursday night. I tell you what, Treasurer, you are going to need all your patience and your biggest ever computer to be able to work out the spending increases, the tax increases and the burgeoning surplus which they are going to provide as well. Just to cap it off, not only has good fiscal policy been great for small business,  and therefore good for jobs, but on the other side they are going to go down to their conference in July - and what is the Leader of the Opposition going to do? He has done it already basically: he is going to give us a public rollover to the trade union leadership and take us back to the 1970s and 1980s, the very thing that the IMF says has in fact - </DOC>

 - The situation is that way back last year the package was negotiated through the parliament in the face of fierce, tenacious and destructive opposition from the Labor Party - and now of course they are going to embrace it. That has to take the cake. You try to stop something coming into operation, you run a fear campaign, you say you are going to roll it back and then in the end you say it is so dreadful and pernicious and malicious that you are really going to keep it. That really does take the cake. But we made it clear that, if there were, by dint of their employment or other arrangements, people who did not enjoy the benefits of the tax reduction package, there would be a process whereby they could apply. This was announced months ago, and it is quite separate from the issue on which the Treasurer gave an answer a few moments ago that there would be.As for the analysis made by NATSEM, we do not automatically accept that. We are completely satisfied that people are not going to be worse off. We believe that, because of the mechanisms that have been put in place, the only people who are going to be worse off are those who are avoiding their proper taxation liabilities. The indications to date are that there is a large number of additions to the estimates of business registrations and therefore the indications are that the effect of all of the measures will be to flush out of the community people who are not meeting their liabilities. That ought to be something that everybody in the parliament supports. We all pay less tax if everybody pays what they ought to pay, and that is a very, very simple principle of the new taxation system. It is now, as I have been reminded, 52 days before this great taxation reform comes into operation. For breadth and scope, it is certainly the most courageous and visionary remaking of the taxation system of this country ever. I say again, and in every answer I give to the opposition I will say the same thing: you know that this is something that is good for Australia. You know that this country has needed tax reform. You know that you did not have the fortitude and the courage when you were in government to persevere with it and you know deep down that you have done the Australian people in the eye by adopting such a destructive and negative attitude towards the attempts by the government to introduce the taxation reform. You also know, as we know, that when this reform is introduced - despite all of your nitpicking, despite all of your scaremongering - when it is bedded down, three things will happen. Firstly, it will be recognised by the Australian people as a great reform. Secondly, you will quietly put aside any idea to change it if ever you are elected to government. You hate it so much that you will hang on to it! Finally, and very importantly, in a few months time the Australian people will remember with contempt your absolute neglect of the national interest in the attitude that you have taken towards tax reform. Over the last 25 years governments on both sides of politics in this country have endeavoured on occasions to make reforms that have been to the long-term benefit of this country. When the former Labor government introduced financial deregulation, it was supported by the coalition. When the former Labor government reformed the tariff system, it was not opposed by the then opposition because it was for the long-term benefit of Australia. By comparison and in contrast, when this government in the last four years, in the name of the national interest, has had the courage to introduce two historic reforms - namely, industrial relations reform and taxation reform - instead of copying the lead of the coalition in opposition, the Labor Party, to its eternal shame, has dudded the national interest -  -  - The Labor Party opposed industrial relations reform and perhaps, although not forgiving them for that, you could understand it because they are still by and of the trade union movement. When it came to taxation reform they had a golden opportunity to do what we did in relation to tariff reform and what we did in relation to financial deregulation - rise to the national interest, put aside temporary partisan advantage - but, no, they failed to do that. Not only is it in government that you can fail the national interest but also you can fail the national interest in opposition. Opposition is not just about opposing for opposition's sake. Oppositions are part of the system. You have great national responsibilities. You have obligations not only to the people that elected you but also to the Australian people, and you have been a miserable failure on this issue. You have done the national interest shamefully in the eye.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. The initiatives in this budget in the social welfare area represent a historic break with the past. Australians today want an end to the philosophy that the Labor Party brought to social security policy, which was the handout mentality based on passive welfare which trapped people year after year in welfare dependency. We all remember how the Labor Party attracted young people out of school by offering them welfare benefits, unemployment benefits, if they dropped out of school and went on the dole. This government pursues an entirely different strategy in relation to welfare. People in this country want to see a real improvement in the capacity of people to help themselves. They do not want to see these problems develop in the first place. They want the incentives in the welfare system right. They want to see this handout mentality pushed into the past. They want to see social security support going to those who really need it. In this budget, the government pursues a fundamentally different approach. It is an approach which is based on the belief that a strategic investment in individuals, in families and in communities is critical to this country's social and economic health. The budget contains a new investment of more than $400 million for individuals, families and communities. Amongst the most important of these items is the $240 million families and communities package, which is an investment in the future of the country, strengthening the ability of families and communities to help themselves. The strongest welfare network in this country is the family. This government is committed to strengthening the capacity of Australian families to bring up the next generation. The initiatives include $65 million to provide greater choice and flexibility in child care, $40 million to establish a stronger families fund, helping parents develop learning skills in their young children, and $37 million to help up to 400 communities develop their leaders and engage up to 10,000 young people in a youth cadetship program. These programs have been fundamentally important in helping many young people get a strong sense of self-esteem and a strong ethic of contributing to their communities, and this is going to be a very important initiative in many communities around Australia.The government has also extended in this budget the youth allowance eligibility by lifting the 50 per cent discount on farm and business assets to 75 per cent. This is an investment in young people and the future of our rural and small business communities. The youth allowance corrects the incentives that were in the dole under Labor for young people to drop out of education. It is a tremendous social reform in itself, and it is currently being extended in a way that will help over 7,000 additional families in rural and regional Australia.In my own portfolio, of course, the government is investing over the next four years some $2 billion in providing new apprenticeships. One of the most significant investments contained in the budget is not a big spending initiative; it is one to put in place three pilot programs with the aim of improving opportunities for the long-term jobless and of helping jobless families and mature aged unemployed people. These are three groups which have not shared as others have in the economic prosperity that Australians are enjoying, and these pilots will be important in helping the Welfare Reform Reference Group to deliver a report which is comprehensively based on programs that will have demonstrated effectiveness. I was very pleased to see the comments of the independent chairman of the Welfare Reform Reference Group about these pilots when he said that they are a step in the right direction and will contribute to the final report of the reference group, which will develop a broad framework for reform of the social support system. This government has put forward real policies, real reform and real improvement, and that is the difference between it and the other side of the House, which has no policies, no direction and no hope of improvement.</DOC>

 - First of all, the questioner reads out a false quote. What I said was that the non-taxation revenue as reported in the budget - which included all GBEs, one of which is Telstra, but as I said specifically another is the Reserve Bank dividend - had delivered bad news. The bad news it had delivered, as was apparent from the budget paper, is that dividends from associated entities, which in 1999-2000 were $6½ billion, had fallen 66 per cent. I would have thought that in anybody's language when you take the combined associated entities a fall of 66 per cent was bad news and -  - I thought that would have been pretty obvious even to the shadow minister.  - Although he yells because he says the market might be worried about share prices -  - Mr Speaker, although he interjects, in defiance of your directions, in a loud voice, I point this out: the Labor Party apparently is now worried about the share price of Telstra, which I welcome. I thought the Labor Party policy was that there should be no shares in Telstra. I thought that the Labor Party actually believed that Telstra should be a nationalised phone company.  - I was going to finish by saying that if the Labor Party is interested in the price of Telstra, which I hope it is, presumably it will now support the full privatisation of Telstra - because nothing could be better for its share price!  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. In response let me say that I have undeniably very good news for this House. As a result of the figures released this morning, I can inform the House that since March of 1996 almost 700,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. That is a direct result of the economic policies that were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. Not only did the Australian Labor Party run up $80 billion of debt in five years, and not only have we had to remove that debt - at the end of this coming budget cycle we will have taken $50 billion out of that $80 billion of Labor debt - but on top of that at every turn the Labor Party has opposed our attempts to reform the Australian economy. That would have been bad enough if economic reform were some kind of ideological or academic debate between the political parties, but it is not. Economic reform delivers flesh and blood social outcomes. There are 700,000 beneficiaries of the economic policies of this government. There are 700,000 Australians of all ages who now have jobs as a result of the policies Mr Beazley opposed. It is quite a double to run up $80 billion of debt in five years and then try to stop your successors tidying up that mess. To add insult to injury, you opposed every single attempt to generate 700,000 jobs for the Australian people. I am proud of what this government has done in the area of job generation. I thank the Minister for Workplace Relations, Employment and Small Business for the contribution that he has made with his industrial relations reforms. It has not only been the economic policies led by the Treasurer, but also it has been the industrial relations reforms and all the other policies - the training policies of the Minister for Education, the employment services policies of the Minister for Employment Services. The good news is that 700,000 more Australians now have jobs as a result of the policies of this government. Those 700,000 people will remember the Leader of the Opposition for leaving us with an $80 billion debt in only five years and also for having opposed every measure of the government designed to generate those 700,000 new jobs.</DOC>

 - The first point, of course, is that the Labor Party thinks that nobody should have a share in Telstra. The Labor Party voted against anybody having a share in Telstra. - The member for Corio interjects to say they already owned it. No, I am sorry, your policy has shifted. You are now worried about the share price of private owners, apparently, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Having voted against any right to ever take a share, having voted against any right to issue the balance of the equity, which is the biggest single constraint on Telstra as a corporation, the Labor Party would feign an interest in the Telstra share price when it believes in a nationalised phone company. No amount of repetition of false quotes from the Leader of the Opposition adds to the false quote which was given by the previous questioner. What I said on Tuesday is what was reported in the budget, that is, dividends from associated entities, that is, all government business entities -   - As I said on Tuesday, and as is reported in the budget papers, dividends from associated entities - that is all government business entities, not just Telstra but principally Telstra and the Reserve Bank - fell from $6.5 billion to $2.2 billion: a fall of 66.6 per cent. A point that I also made was that that led non-taxation revenue overall - notwithstanding licence fees which were up, as I also explained in the budget - to fall by 13.6 per cent. Mr Speaker, if you were to read precisely what I said, it was dividends from Telstra and the Reserve Bank. In relation to Telstra, of course dividends came down from 1999-2000 to 2000-01, one of the reasons being special dividends, which were in 1999-2000. In relation to the Reserve Bank, of course, the dividend comes down, but I will not be going into the reasons as to why that is the case, other than to say that the government cumulates all of its dividends, as it always has; it does not isolate them. And, as we reported in the budget, a point that I made on Tuesday, they fall by 66 per cent - I think anybody who looked at that would say that they would rather it did not - and a 66 per cent fall in associated dividends was bad news.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. Of course, the government's strong economic policy has set Australia up for a strong economic performance into the next century. The Prime Minister has just stated probably the most important change in fiscal policy that has occurred in this country. Five Labor budgets: a run-up of $80 billion worth of debt; and then five coalition budgets that not only pay for themselves but over and above that pay back $50 billion of Labor debt. In one of the most confused, convoluted, rambling, illogical doorsteps ever, this morning the Leader of the Opposition in his prolix way was asked what he would do. He made this interesting piece of economic analysis. Listen to this. This is from the Leader of the Opposition. He said, `You have choices as to how you spend a surplus.' That is the first point at which I stop. Of course, if you spend it, it is not a surplus. `You have choices as to how you spend a surplus.' A surplus, if I may say so, is something you have not spent. But since, in two years as finance minister, he cumulated deficits of $23 billion, it is a point that might have escaped him. He said, `You have choices as to how to spend a surplus.' Now listen to this - this is an interesting Freudian slip - `The surplus created by those massive cuts three years ago.' Created by those massive cuts three years ago! I thought the budget was already in surplus before those cuts three years ago. I thought the budget was in surplus in 1995-96. `The surplus created by those massive cuts three years ago.' I also pause to make this point about those so-called massive cuts: every single one of them was opposed by the Labor Party. So the surplus was created by massive cuts, every single one of which you opposed. If you had had your way, there would never have been a surplus. Listen to the words out of his own mouth: `You have choices how to spend a surplus.' `The surplus created by those massive cuts three years ago.' A completed mission that, if Labor had had its way, there would never have been a surplus. And then he said, `You could have left a bit more in the surplus. You could have cut tax less. You could have put more resources into education, more into health, more into schools, more into innovation and more into business.'Tonight when the Leader of the Opposition stands up to give his budget reply, he is going to announce how he is going to roll back the GST and all of the revenue that that is going to cost. We will recall that, yesterday, he thought the income tax cuts were not great enough because they would be clawed back, so presumably he is also in favour of more long-lasting income tax cuts. He has been out today saying that he is in favour of education increases. He is in favour of health increases as well. He is in favour of infrastructure increases and he is in favour of more money for schools. He is in favour of more money for innovation. He is in favour of more money for business and, guess what? He also supports a larger surplus. So tonight he is going to cut tax, he is going to spend bigger and, at the end of it, he is going to produce another surplus - no doubt a surplus like his last two budgets, which just happened to accumulate a $23 billion deficit. Today we had the news, as the Prime Minister said, that unemployment has fallen again. There are now 700,000 more Australians in work as a result of this government's efforts over the last four years, since it was elected. That is a strong economy and that is a real fiscal policy. They are the benefits of running good economic policy. We were fought every step of the way by the Labor Party. The best thing about their efforts is that they were not successful. </DOC>

 - I do not know what claims the member for Hotham is referring to, but the matters I have put on the record are the matters that are in the budget. I referred to them in the budget and I referred to them in the press conference, and they are these: dividends from associated entities, which are always included in the budget and never broken down, fell from $6.5 billion in 1999 to $2.2 billion in 2000-2001 - a 66 per cent fall. That includes government business enterprises such as Telstra -  - Mr Speaker, I am saying that the budget discloses dividends from associated entities, which includes government business entities, including Telstra and the Reserve Bank, and it pays dividends. In an accumulated way it states what the total outcome is. The budget has always done it in a total way. It has done it for all of the five budgets that this government has brought down. It did it through all of the Labor Party budgets. It never isolates them, nor does the government ever disclose individual dividends. - I am explaining the budget papers, which always disclose total dividends from total organisations. As a former finance minister would have known, I would have thought, it is never broken down. It never has been. It never was by you when you were finance minister. It never has been under us and it never will be done because the government does not disclose or break down the individual dividends. We did not do it in this budget just as you never did it in 13 budgets - and we have done the same in the last five budgets. We put in a global amount, which obviously includes both Telstra and the Reserve Bank. As I have consistently pointed out, it has fallen from $6.5 billion to $2.2 billion. In respect of Telstra, a big part of that is obviously the special dividend that was paid in 1999-2000. There is also a fall, as I also said in my press conference, in relation to RBA dividends. We do not itemise them; we do not disclose them individually. It has never been done in Australian practice. It was never done under 13 years of Labor government and it is has not been done under five years of this government; it would not be sensible commercial practice. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Medicare has served people in city Australia very well but it does have some failings. It has failed country people in providing an adequate number of medical practitioners and access to medical services. This budget is not about giving country people anything special but simply redressing the imbalance so that country people can access what people in the city take for granted. Because of that there is a regional health strategy that has received wide acclamation and involves a number of areas with particular initiatives, such as our $102 million program to get half of all general practice training in rural Australia; greater support for rural doctors by providing support services through divisions; our bonded scholarship scheme, which is tied to Medicare provider restrictions; 100 new places each and every year in universities; and almost $70 million to top up our successful regional health services program. These are just some of the initiatives that were in the budget on Tuesday night.The budget has had a very good response from a wide range of people around Australia. The Council on the Ageing, in a media release, have welcomed the initiatives to revitalise nursing in small regional hospitals. Older people want facilities near their homes, likewise increased allied health services attached to general practice are welcome. The Australian Medical Association, not always one of the greatest supporters of the government, put out a press release and said:It is certainly good for health. It will get extra doctors and specialists out there, and it is the sort of thing we've been suggesting.Barry Hailstone, in the Adelaide Advertiser, has called it `the biggest boost to people living in rural and remote areas since the introduction of the Flying Doctor Service'. In government you never expect to receive support from your political opponents, but I can report to the House that that is exactly what has happened. The Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, a former health minister, said on ABC radio yesterday:I do have to give some accolades though, John. I think that the efforts to increase medical services and doctors in the bush is good. I fully supported that. As a former health minister I think that's very significant.I welcome Mr Beattie's comments, as do all my colleagues. We have worked hard on this budget. I look forward to the opposition joining with us and with the Premier of Queensland in supporting these initiatives.</DOC>

 - As usual, it is a farrago of confusion and misrepresentation from the member for Hotham. What I said last night, and I will repeat it, is that Australians deserved income tax cuts. One of the main reasons why they deserved them was that the last time they were promised them they were not paid for one day and one dollar. - `That's rubbish,' he says. They were not paid for one day and one dollar - the famous l-a-w. Once the Keating government was elected, they were not paid for one day and one dollar. What the public got instead was an increase in wholesale sales tax. I will go back - it is the first time I have heard it: apparently, according to the member for Hotham, the l-a-w tax cuts were paid. Apparently they were paid after the 1993 election. That is a most extraordinary proposition. We have been labouring here since 1993 under the assumption that the Labor Party never paid its income tax cuts after the 1993 election. We have all been wrong, and the only person who knew it was the member for Hotham. What an astounding proposition! - Mr Speaker, as I was saying, the Australian public deserved income tax cuts because the last time they were promised them was prior to the 1993 election. I say `promised' - but, of course, the then Labor Party boasted that they were l-a-w. After the 1993 election the tax cuts were taken away and not paid for a day or a dollar. I think that has been totally agreed in Australian politics, apart from the new novel proposition that has been put here for the first time by the member for Hotham this afternoon. The government's income tax cuts, which will come into place -  - That is why Australians deserve income tax cuts. The great news is that in 51 days time the largest income tax cuts in Australian history are going to become reality. On 1 July every Australian taxpayer gets an income tax cut. If you happen to be a middle income earner you can currently be on 43c in the dollar and your rate will be cut to 30c. Australians deserved income tax cuts anyway because of that shameful episode by Labor in 1993, and we took the opportunity to reform the indirect tax system as well and the business tax system. As a consequence of reforming the indirect tax system by broadening the base with a lower rate, with a goods and services tax, we were able to give far greater income tax relief than would otherwise have been the case. That is because the goods and services tax is broad based and not a declining share of the budget. The goods and services tax is the revenue that goes to the state governments which will enable them to build their hospitals, their schools and their roads in the future. It will grow in accord with the economy. It will make sure that those basic services are rendered. As a result, the taxpayers of Australia will get sensible spending. They will get great income tax cuts. They will have a new Australian taxation system. The good news is: although it was fought every step of the way, although the Labor Party voted against every step that was necessary to get there, the Labor Party campaign was defeated. We now know that the Labor Party, after fighting every step of the way, intends to try to slip into office and take advantage of it. But this was the side of politics that took the decisions, that made the hard yards, that had the vision, and this is the side of politics that has delivered income tax cuts. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. When it comes to Australia's fascinating outback, he of course understands it as well or better than anyone else in the country. His is a huge area with perhaps less than 200,000 people. It is quite unique. The largest city is probably Kalgoorlie, but it spreads across much of mainland Australia and sees people living in the most extraordinary, sometimes very difficult and certainly often very unique circumstances. At the same time it has to be said that it is a region of great economic and social importance to the nation. There is no doubt that the budget initiatives that were announced in this place a couple of nights ago by the Treasurer are of very real value to the outback and the people in the outback of this country. The package of $1.8 billion does actually contain a couple of specifics that I would like to draw people's attention to. For example, helping people in isolated regions access education for their children on a reasonably equitable basis, keeping in mind that most of us take for granted that, one way or another, we can get our children to the school gate pretty much for free. That is simply not the case for people who live in some of the most isolated regions on earth. The extra assistance through the isolated children's allowance scheme has been very widely welcomed indeed. So, too, has the better access to Youth Allowance, with the further discounting of business assets. Mr Speaker, another important aspect of the budget is that we are doubling funding for the remoter Service Subsidy Scheme. That is a very, very important aspect of life in remote parts of the country. I see that another member from the far north of Queensland, Warren Entsch, well understands how important this is. Indeed, as the ICPA has said, often the scheme is a vital link and the only sustainable communication link at all for many people in the far flung and remote parts of this country. Mr Speaker, $260 million over 13 years under the regional equalisation plan will ensure that remote Australia shares in the benefits offered by the world of digital television and datacasting services. Five million will be provided to subsidise the transmission costs of community based self-help broadcast groups in remote areas and that will ensure that remote communities have the best possible access to broadcasting services. The Year of the Outback in the year 2002 will be supported by all states and territories, by tourism - Jackie Kelly, the minister for tourism, has been a very enthusiastic backer of this planned year of activities - the private sector is involved, as is the tourism industry itself. We will be contributing financially to this great effort to raise people's awareness of the outback in terms of investment opportunities and in terms of tourism potential. The Community Development Employment Program, the CDEP scheme, will be expanded by 1,500 places. That is of enormous value to many, many people in rural and regional areas but particularly in remote parts of the country. These budget measures add to very important initiatives under way.We know that the ALP want to abandon commitments on tax reform. One of the things that has not been drawn out properly is the enormous importance of abolishing the impact of embedded taxes on exports. Outback Australia is an export based economy and we are crippling ourselves, one hand tied behind our back, with a tax system that they continue to insist is modern and up to date. Mr Speaker, $4½ billion of that embedded taxation in our exports sector will be washed out by tax reform. They have also of course continually opposed our reforms on transport fuel. One of the great killers of economic growth and development in far flung regions of Australia is the high cost of transport, and they have opposed, every inch of the way, our attempts to reduce transport costs, which will now come into place from 1 July. Mr Speaker, they have also sought of course to stand in the way of such vitally important measures as those that have resulted from the T2 sale of Telstra - $150 million for untimed local call access to remote areas; that is a very valuable reform coming up indeed. Let me return briefly to the importance of health flights. If you live in a far flung part of this country, health is of critical importance, and everywhere today I have noticed the commentators saying we have got the priority right. The attention to health in rural and regional and remote areas is important, is needed and should head the list. I note the laudatory remarks that are being made about my colleague the minister for health are very widespread indeed. The National Rural Health Alliance have warmly welcomed the range of new initiatives. They are going to write to you, Minister, to congratulate you - as indeed they might. We see Dr David Mildenhall, National President of the Rural Doctors Association - I think in fact a constituent of the member for Kalgoorlie - has said that the Howard-Anderson government has built on `the Wooldridge ministry's previous good work' in the bush. Then we have Dr Ken Mackay, New South Wales President of the Rural Doctors Association, saying today: The reason that this has come together is that health minister Michael Wooldridge listened when he was out in regional areas.So I can tell you one thing: if there is one group in the Australian community that absolutely supports and stands rock solid behind the minister for health, it is rural and regional and remote Australia. </DOC>

 - Part of the reform of the taxation system, a reform which has been opposed every step of the way by Labor, was to reform Commonwealth-state relations. That was put forward in the New Tax System document. We said in the New Tax System document that we would make up to the states the guaranteed minimum payment, which was subsequently agreed to and was signed into an agreement. The guaranteed minimum payment is to be made up by those loans and also by the revenue from the GST so the Commonwealth can ensure that the states are no worse off over the five-year period. The Prime Minister and I well remember being at the meeting to sign this agreement with every Labor state. - I think the first person to rush up with his pen to sign it was Premier Bob Carr. I felt this rustle behind me, and it was actually the Treasurer of Tasmania pushing his way down past me to get his signature on the documents. - It was the Treasurer. - As each one of them signed, they signed an agreement asking the Commonwealth to provide them with loans. This is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. - I was asked a question about the loans to the states, and the point that I make is that not only was it our policy but also it is now a unanimous agreement between the Commonwealth and the six states which we are obliged to pay - an agreement which was signed by representatives of all of the Labor states with that treatment, including the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania. That is why it is done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. There is no question whatsoever that there are some people within the trade union movement and within the Australian Labor Party who are anxious to destroy the system of enterprise bargaining which was introduced in Australia by our predecessors in the early 1990s and which has been very effective. The Prime Minister today spoke of 699,000-plus jobs being created - nearly 700,000 jobs. One of the reasons for that is that we have been reforming the workplace relations system, and the introduction of enterprise bargaining was an important element of that. Whilst we had our many criticisms of the reform legislation introduced by the member for Kingsford-Smith, we were, however, always consistent in saying that, to the extent that enterprise bargaining was introduced, it was the right policy for this country. In 1996 not only did we endorse the concept of enterprise bargaining but also this parliament went further and saw the entrenchment of enterprise bargaining in both the unionised and non-unionised sector. In Victoria - and one should hardly be surprised that this would be coming out of Victoria, given that they now have Steve Bracks as Premier and a Labor government - in the manufacturing sector, there is a campaign called Campaign 2000, which is aimed at undermining enterprise bargaining. Such a threat is this campaign - so I am informed by the media - that it is referred to in Steve Bracks's office as `Apocalypse Now'. They ought to be concerned because many jobs will be lost unless these campaigns to knock off enterprise bargaining are in some way resisted. This government's policy is to introduce further measures to the Workplace Relations Act to achieve the retention of the system of enterprise bargaining. We intend to give new powers to the Industrial Relations Commission to prevent the industrial action associated with pattern bargaining. New powers will be given to the commission to act in a timely way to require a return to work. We will also provide the commission with a new power to order a cooling-off period where it believes that to be appropriate - an idea which even Steve Bracks, the Labor Premier in Victoria, thought was sensible only a month or so ago. Lastly, as the fourth of four measures, we intend introducing by legislation today a measure which will ensure that the states' supreme courts continue to have jurisdiction to deal with common-law matters, which they have long held but which has been subject to anti-suit applications in recent times.To give you a sense of the threat which is now being mounted by the ACTU and some unions, Doug Cameron, for example, said recently:It is a simple fact that the ALP cannot survive or win government without the support of trade union members.Julius Roe from the AMWU said:I support militant action. You can't win things without militant struggle - an obvious reference to the widespread industrial action and chaos that some of these union leaders are intent on bringing upon the manufacturing sector. Craig Johnston, also from the AMWU, said:The employers make us out as mad. But if we were mad, we wouldn't have won all these disputes. We've been threatened with fines and jail, but we haven't paid and we aren't in jail.Even within the Labor Party, you must realise that there are some people who are intent on destroying a system which you yourselves supported.The member for Kingsford-Smith, for example, back in August 1993, at a lunch hosted by none other than the now shadow minister, said this about the move to enterprise bargaining:We are unquestionably moving towards a system in which the primary emphasis is on workplace bargaining underpinned by awards, a system where for the majority of employees wages and conditions of work are covered by workplace agreements: agreements between workplace participants, agreements that are tailored to the needs of individual enterprises and based on improving the productive performance of those enterprises. I am encouraged by the commitment of all parties to this objective.The test today is whether or not the Leader of the Opposition can stand up to the ACTU and remain committed to a policy which has demonstrably provided great benefits to the Australian people: 700,000 jobs and much improved productivity performance since we have been in. - The Leader of the Opposition is between a rock and a hard place. This is a real test for the Leader of the Opposition. When he stands tonight, not only is he going to tell us where the income tax cuts are going to come from, where all the expenditure is going to come from, how he is going to keep his surplus, how he is going to roll back and when he is going to roll over - what he has to do is to give us some sense of what his commitment is to genuine structural reform, particularly in the labour market. He has got to distance himself from the trade unions, who are trying to knock over the system the Labor Party once supported when it was in government. We hope to have this legislation through by 1 July. This is a real test for the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for that recent speech. It began with the question about the New South Wales government document and whether I had seen it. No, of course I have not seen it. Would I be worried to see it? Of course I would not be worried to see it, because not only have we put down our tax package, which the states demanded, including the loans, not only have we had it in our budgets for the last two years, but also we have had at least two Special Premiers Conferences where the New South Wales Treasurer has never raised anything of such a dimension with me. The only issue he has ever raised with me is that I guarantee his loan. If federal Labor is against the loans, I would like to hear it. But I can assure them that state Labor has never raised it with me for one minute. They are demanding that we deliver on our agreement, which required it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. This budget continues the government's commitment to lifting standards and widening access to education for young Australians, particularly in regional and rural Australia. In this budget the government continues its massive investment in the nation's schools, with school expenditure rising by around one-third over the next four years. It is worth noting that Commonwealth expenditure on schooling, and on government schooling in particular, is rising considerably faster at the present time than state expenditures; in fact, by some 21 per cent over the four years, having increased by 25 per cent over the last four.The high priority that we are giving to making sure that all young Australians get the skills they need is indicated by the $2 billion that this government will be providing over the next four years for new apprenticeships. Once again, the government has delivered on its commitment to science and research with its continuing strong support for Strategic Partnerships for Industry of some $62.8 million over three years.Children in remote Australia have been of particular importance to this government. We have seen a significant increase in funding of $16.4 million for the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme and for Abstudy over the next four years. This will be supplemented by the decision we have taken in relation to the assets test for the youth allowance which, once again, will expand access to schooling for young Australians. As Megan McNicholl of the Isolated Children's Parents Association said:It certainly makes education more affordable and it will relieve an enormous amount of pressure on those families that are struggling financially for all sorts of reasons in rural and remote communities. I was asked whether I was aware of any other comments on the government's education budget. I am not aware of any comment reported in the press from the member for Dobell. I do not know whether or not he issued a press release, but presumably he has some views on the budget which we will be informed about at some time. I am aware of comments made by the authors of the Labor Party's policy, the Australian Education Union.  - Shazza has stepped aside for Dazza now. He is now heading up the union. The Australian Education Union has issued a press release which is full of misleading statements and untruths. Rather than going through them all, I will just pick out the biggest doozey of them all, which is that the Australian Education Union claimed that - listen to this - `education spending under the Howard government was $5 billion less than under the Fraser government'. It is hard to even imagine that that could be true. The fact is that total `education spending under the Fraser government in its last year was $3.8 billion. Total education spending in this budget is $11.6 billion. School funding has increased by about 125 per cent in real terms, in constant dollar terms, for schooling since the Fraser government. Yet those who write the Labor Party's education policy are saying that it is $5 billion less. There is a message in this for the Leader of the Opposition. He has to stop waiting by that letterbox for the brown paper package to arrive from the Australian Education Union with a policy in it - because it is not going to be there. If it does arrive, you can be quite sure that the sums in it will be absolutely wrong. We see why you bungled in the past. I would not take any notice of them in the future.</DOC>

 - This government has reformed Commonwealth-state relations pursuant to a unanimous agreement with six states and two territories, one of the conditions of which is that we make them loans. - Mr Speaker, he asked me about loans which the Commonwealth will make to the states in 2000-01, which it is making as a consequence of Commonwealth-state financial reform which was signed up to unanimously by six states and two territories and requires the Commonwealth to pay loans. Your view may be that instead of loaning the states money we should give it to them. Your view probably is that we should spend more money, but we have negotiated to make them loans. We are going to deliver on that. If you are about to take your leave from all of these fancy sorts of things, I will look tonight at your idea which would be not to loan money to the states, which of course means that they have to repay it, but to give it to them. I will be looking tonight for you to be announcing that you are not going to make loans; that you want higher grants to the states and higher spending on education, higher spending on health, higher spending on infrastructure and less spending on GST and a bigger surplus. I will wait for it. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Page for his question. I know he has a very keen interest in this agreement, as have a number of other members of the coalition. The Preparing for Work Agreement is about helping people focus on getting back into the labour market as quickly as possible. All Newstart recipients, as of 1 July, will be required to sign a Preparing for Work Agreement. It is about identifying those barriers to entry; it is about getting those people back into employment as quickly as possible. As part of that, we are saying that any job is better than no job, even if it is part-time work, and we are ensuring that these people go through a literacy or numeracy program, that they do their job applications over the fortnight and also that they fully understand their mutual obligation requirements. That is because we know that if people are out of work for a longer period of time it is much harder for them to get employment. This government is absolutely committed to getting people into employment, and that is why today unemployment rates are at 6.8 per cent. There have been 700,000 new jobs created by this government, which is 300,000 more jobs than were created by the Australian Labor Party when they were in office for their last six years.We also recognise that 30 per cent of job seekers spend less than five hours a fortnight looking for employment. We are dedicated to ensuring that they spend more time looking for employment. That is why we have this one-to-one service with Centrelink and that is why we have this expanded program, along with the Job Network and of course New Apprenticeships, creating more opportunities for and helping Newstart recipients. Compare this to the halcyon days of the Australian Labor Party, when unemployment rates were at 11 per cent. They wasted taxpayers' money through the Working Nation program and the creation of the accord with the ACTU, which did not create more jobs. They were populist programs which just recycled people into unemployment. That is why tonight the Australian public will be looking very closely at the Leader of the Opposition to find out what types of programs he will be offering to the Australian people - because they will be vacuous. There will be no programs. It will be just like your welfare reform - a waste of taxpayers' money. That is why we are on about stronger compliance and more targeted programs to help the unemployed, not populist policies based on borrowed money or increased taxes. That is what we will be watching for from Collins Class Kim tonight. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her not totally unexpected question. It is true that the Auditor-General's report has shown that. - But 15 months ago, on 11 February, on the best evidence we had, there was no evidence that they had all been ordered. The Health Insurance Commission investigation is something that is separate from the minister and I was not given regular bulletins on it. So it was a correct statement at the time. Clearly, there were a large number of machines ordered and the Auditor-General gives a plausible explanation for that. The Auditor-General has spent six months doing a very thorough report. He has interviewed 135 people under oath or affirmation. He has had access to all departmental documents. He has had the full cooperation of me and my staff and he has found no impropriety on my behalf, he has found no evidence of negligence on my behalf and he has in fact found no evidence of a budget leak. Not a single person who gave evidence under oath has said there was a budget leak. This confirms what I have been saying all along. If you wish to go to the specific paragraphs in his report, as I am sure we will as we debate this further, the fact is that six months of investigation by the Auditor-General has come up with no leak whatsoever.</DOC>

Regrettably, I can confirm that a Work for the Dole project for 140 participants in ACT schools will now not happen because of union sabotage. This brings to five the number of projects that have not proceeded thanks to a union veto and it brings to nearly 600 the number of young Australians who are denied this kind of valuable work experience thanks to union intransigence. This is a clear case of double standards on the part of the Australian Education Union and the ACTU. The union obviously supports - and should support - parents and citizens coming into schools to help with things like reading and playground supervision, but it opposes Work for the Dole participants going into schools. The union supported New Work Opportunities people going into schools - in fact, the union actually urged the then government to have such a scheme - but it opposes Work for the Dole, even though this program is actually getting a 50 per cent better outcome than the old New Work Opportunities program. Thankfully, the dinosaurs of the union movement are not damaging this program, which is going from strength to strength, as the Treasurer pointed out in his budget this week - which was a tour de force even by his own high standards. This government has announced 600 new Work for the Dole projects involving 11,000 extra participants so far this year. The unions, by contrast, are always dictating the policy of the federal opposition. The former shadow employment minister, the member for Batman, used to encourage community groups to participate and to make the most of the Work for the Dole program. One can only assume that the current shadow minister's deafening silence about Work for the Dole shows that Labor's policy is now clear: it is whatever the unions want. Labor's policy on Work for the Dole is whatever the unions want. There you have the member for Dickson and the President of the ACTU - the Shezza and Shazza show. Shezza rings Shazza and says, `What do you want? I'll give you whatever it takes.' - Mr Speaker, you are right, and I do withdraw. The point I am making is that the union movement is now dictating the federal opposition's attitude to an important policy designed to help the job seekers of Australia. - That is right. I have been asked about alternative policies and views, as is the custom in this House. -  - I certainly was asked about alternative policies and views. The fact is that the alternative policy is being dictated by the union movement. But what can we expect? - Thank you. If you actually look for alternative policies, about the only policy you can find opposite is the pledge, which members opposite take, to work for the nationalisation of the means of distribution, production and exchange. This is the modern Labor Party! These are the advocates of new economics - still pledged in the year 2000 to the democratic socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to make a constructive contribution to public life, as well as providing us with his tax policies and his spending policies tonight he ought to stand up and pledge himself to two simple things. First of all, he will pledge to abolish the socialisation objective and, second, he will pledge to abolish the union bloc vote. - I am simply inviting the Leader of the Opposition to change the things that he can influence and that he ought to change. These are the things that he does have responsibility for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for raising the importance of regional Australia and the initiatives in this week's budget to benefit regional Australia. On the very night when the Leader of the Opposition is to respond to the budget, when you would think that those opposite would be focusing on the content of the budget, they have already lost interest. They have no new proposals. We await tonight with great interest to hear the way in which the Leader of the Opposition will deliver on the proposed measures that they have been criticising in the budget.There can be no doubt that this week's budget is the most significant for rural and regional Australia in a generation. There is about $1.8 billion worth of new initiatives for regional Australia and they will provide real benefits for all people living outside the capital cities. During the presentation of the budget speech, I listened to the opposition scoff about these important initiatives for country Australia, and they are scoffing again now. They do not care about regional Australia. It is about time that they recognised that all Australians are entitled to a fair deal when it comes to health care, education, roads and other services. That is what is being delivered in this budget. There is $500 million plus for health care; significant new initiatives for education; more money to assist families, particularly low income families; money to extend digital television to country Australia; and more money for roads, particularly bridges in regional areas. All of those are very significant initiatives. Many on this side will be particularly welcoming the new initiatives in relation to agriculture, the new Agriculture - Advancing Australia package. This government introduced a comprehensive package of measures with Agriculture - Advancing Australia that have provided real assistance to thousands of farmers around Australia. Many of those measures were due to expire. This budget includes not only an extension of those measures but a substantial enhancement. There will be a merger of the old Property Management Planning program and FarmBis, and a doubling of funding to support farmers in these important planning areas. There is a new Farm Innovation Program to support the implementation of new initiatives in agriculture. There is the new farm help scheme to provide welfare and other assistance to farmers in need. There is the new $30.5 million biotechnology strategy. There is also more money available to assist with plant and animal health and to upgrade our quarantine measures - all very significant matters for Australian farmers.More money will be spent under the Natural Heritage Trust - $180 million for research and development. There will be more money for the Murray-Darling. I was surprised to read the shadow minister for agriculture suggesting, in a remarkable feat of mathematical illiteracy, that the $309 million extra that we are going to be spending on agriculture is actually less money. I heard him say that the $40 million extra being spent on environmental matters is actually less money. If that is the kind of logic that the Leader of the Opposition is going to use in his budget reply tonight, we might actually get to hear something more about how the finance minister who delivered the greatest deficits that our country has ever known is somehow or other going to return a larger surplus while spending more! That is the kind of logic that has been associated with their responses.People who live in rural Australia know the real substance of the content of this budget and the real benefits it will deliver to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. He well knows the significance of the conversion in rural Australia to digital and datacaster broadcasting from analog. He also well knows what happened the last time there was such a technological revolution for people in country areas, from analog to digital. That was in the early 1990s when the Labor Party handed over to digital transmission broadcasting techniques and broadcasters without any transition arrangements, without any safety net for country people. It took this government with its CDMA initiatives to protect the interests of country people and ensure that they had access to the latest telephone technology and associated technologies. Now we are doing it again in regard to digital television and datacasting services. We are providing up to $260 million for the regional equalisation plan, with an allocation of $22 million this year, which represents 50 per cent of the estimated costs of digital conversion for regional broadcasters. It is a partnership between regional broadcasters and the government. We also have a partnership with rural communities. We will ensure that community based self-help retransmission groups are able to obtain access to transmission sites at less than commercial rates. This is a $5 million matching of the $5 million funds from NTL, the new owner of the national transmission network. That will help smaller communities to establish and operate equipment to retransmit commercial and national television and radio services that they otherwise would not have access to. At the same time we are injecting very significant funds into the public broadcasters ABC and SBS. ABC will receive an additional $36.5 million and SBS almost $30 million for digital equipment over and above previously announced funding. We have also given a commitment to fully fund the cost of digital television transmission and distribution. So it is a very substantial commitment to the ABC and SBS as they enter the digital era. You can see the contrast between the Labor Party when in government and the coalition parties when in government. We do not deprive country and regional viewers and users of the latest technology or of access to all the advantages it can bring. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I indicate to him that, in a short while, the foreign minister will be having something to say about this subject. I know I speak for everybody in the parliament in saying how horrified we were at the abrogation of democracy. Only a few weeks ago I met Mr Chaudhry here in Canberra and he was the democratically elected leader of a fellow Commonwealth member. He did not deserve to have his life threatened. The behaviour of Speight, the weakness of the Great Council of Chiefs, the general disintegration of democratic processes in that country are very disturbing. But most disturbing of all is the suggestion that Fiji may in future have a racially based constitution. That is the point of real departure as far as the government is concerned. That is unacceptable in relation to any country in the world and I have made it constantly plain on behalf of the government that, if constitutional processes are not restored - and I tend to share the view of the Leader of the Opposition that that is extremely unlikely - then there have to be some consequences. The situation is, nonetheless, still somewhat fluid. The news coming out almost on an hourly basis does not give one any cause for optimism. I think it is profoundly regrettable that Fiji looks as though it is going back to a racially based constitution. That is always unacceptable, no matter what the country is and no matter what the circumstances are. The response of the government to that if it is on any continuing basis, which it looks as though it will be, will be appropriate and will be strong. I know from what the Leader of the Opposition has already said and from the tenor of his question that the government's attitude will have the total support of the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer, who, as all members of the House would know, has a great interest in Fiji and a concern for the situation there. I am sure also that all members of the House share the Prime Minister's deep concern for this tragic crisis that has occurred in Fiji and are outraged at the activities of Mr Speight and his colleagues. As of today the immediate concern for all interested parties is the release of all the hostages, including the elected Prime Minister and his ministers. The government has been in very close consultation with the New Zealand government. I have in the course of this morning spoken with the New Zealand foreign minister and both our cabinet and the New Zealand cabinet have been giving consideration to this issue today. Both of our countries believe that we should maintain all necessary measures to prevent Speight from entering either Australia or New Zealand and I will also move against other individuals involved in the hostage taking. I have instructed our missions abroad to seek the cooperation of other like-minded governments to take measures against what can only be described as terrorists.Along with New Zealand, we have reviewed a range of other measures which we will put in place unless constitutional government is returned to in Fiji. The measures that the New Zealand government is announcing today are somewhat similar to ours, but there are slightly different circumstances for New Zealand and so there are some variations. I would like to pay tribute to the New Zealand government for the cooperation there has been. I think it makes a great difference if our two countries operate in a cooperative way, and we have certainly been able to do that.The measures that we will take unless constitutional government is returned to in Fiji are: a suspension of the Australia-Fiji Trade and Economic Relations Agreement; the downgrading of our aid relationship, in particular the suspension of projects involving the Fiji public sector and the awarding of new scholarships; the suspension of forthcoming naval visits and joint military exercises; and a thorough review of sporting contacts, including in particular a possible ban on the Fiji national rugby union team from visiting Australia. I am expecting to attend the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group meeting in London on 6 June, that is next Tuesday, and, unless there are some positive developments in Fiji between now and then, I will be moving at that meeting for the suspension of Fiji from the Commonwealth.The government has also decided that in the circumstances it would be entirely inappropriate for the Olympic torch, which after all is a symbol of peace, to pass through Fiji. The New South Wales Minister for the Olympics, Michael Knight, and I have also agreed that, in the light of the deteriorating security situation in Fiji, it would also be inappropriate for the torch relay to visit Fiji, and that is of course a particular formulation that SOCOG would wish to emphasise. We have decided, in the event of these sanctions being imposed, not to reverse the decision to extend the import credit scheme which the government made following the recent visit to Australia by Fiji's Prime Minister. To apply trade sanctions of that kind and more generally would have a wholly disproportionate impact on the Fiji-Indian section of the community. The government obviously has to weigh that in the balance. Finally, my department has just issued a further travel advice which urges all Australians to consider deferring travel to Fiji. Australian citizens currently in Suva are strongly advised to either leave Fiji or temporarily relocate within Fiji. I have instructed the department to reopen the crisis centre to monitor ongoing developments.</DOC>

 - The short answer to that question is that the government has been working on contingency plans for the evacuation of people from Fiji. In addition to that, the honourable member asks about Fijian citizens. We would have to look at that on a case by case basis, but inevitably the government does have contingency plans. We hope it will not be necessary to implement those contingency plans; but, as has been the case in previous situations - in East Timor and Cambodia - over the last three years, we have a plan ready to put into action quickly if the worst comes to the worst.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. It is unusual to comment on matters relating to visas, but I can inform the House that Mr Speight was the holder of a visa entitling him to re-enter Australia. That visa has been cancelled. The action was taken under the sections of the Migration Act which provide for cancellation on grounds that `the presence of its holder in Australia is, or would be, a risk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community'. Mr Speight therefore no longer holds a valid visa entitling him to re-enter Australia. If he were ever to apply for a new visa to re-enter, character considerations stemming from his current activities would obviously be taken into account in assessing any applications.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The question of who the Commonwealth Secretary-General's mediator in the Solomon Islands should be is a matter for the Secretary-General himself. I was in communication with the Secretary-General on Saturday, and we had quite an extensive discussion about the situation in the Solomon Islands. I can say that, to the best of my knowledge, he does not have any plans to replace General Rabuka as the mediator, but of course the situation in Fiji is such that there is not much in any case that General Rabuka can do. But this will no doubt be a matter that he, the Secretary-General, will consider over the next few days. The honourable member implicitly raises the question of the participation by Fijian police in the Commonwealth's multilateral police presence in the Solomon Islands. This is indeed a question that the government is addressing and, again, is a matter that I have discussed with my New Zealand counterpart, Mr Goff. There are proposals for additional police to be provided from Vanuatu, and Vanuatu has, to the best of my knowledge, been quite positive in offering a considerable number of police for this exercise. Considerations are being given further by Australia, New Zealand and others to other sources for the additional police. It is certainly necessary for police to be provided; there is no question of that. The government is committed to funding 50 police at the request of the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands. We are maintaining that commitment. In addition to the commitment under the Commonwealth's multilateral policing operation, there are some Australian advisers on the ground in the Solomon Islands as well, assisting with the policing task there. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can report to the House that the government originally estimated that there would be 2.1 million Australian business numbers and that, as of today, 2.05 million Australian business numbers have been registered. It is 50,000 fewer than was estimated and, clearly, the government will exceed its forecast because there are on hand 2.36 million when the original estimate was that there would be 2.1 million registrations.I can also inform the House that the government has exceeded its estimate for registration for GST. The original estimate was that there would be 1.4 million businesses registered for GST. As of today, 1.5 million have registered, and there are 1.7 million applications. The good news is that, notwithstanding the obstruction tactics of the Labor Party and notwithstanding the efforts of the unions to put work bans on in the Australian Taxation Office, the campaign has failed and the government will meet its expectations in relation to registration for GST. There are still two days in May left. I would urge any business that has not put in its application to do so in the next two days. If they make their application in the next two days, they can be guaranteed registration by 1 July. Even if they do not make their application in the next two days, I would nonetheless urge them to make their application. They cannot be guaranteed a number by 1 July, but they will be guaranteed a number as soon as possible. I remind businesses that if they are not registered for GST on 1 July they are nonetheless required to remit GST without having the ability to collect it in relation to their sales. I remind businesses that if they are not registered for the Australian business number by 1 July they can be subject to withholding at the full marginal tax rate. One of the great things about this new tax system is that it will make it much harder to operate in the black economy. That has been shown to date. Those honest taxpayers who have been looking for tax relief will support the government in its efforts to close down the black economy so that decent, ordinary, hardworking families can get the tax relief that they deserve.</DOC>

Can I say that it was a very strong demonstration of the commitment of a large number of Australians to the process of reconciliation. For that reason, it was a wholly welcomed thing. On the question of a national apology, the Leader of the Opposition knows the attitude that I have expressed previously on behalf of the government. There was a resolution conveying unanimously the sincere regret of this House in relation to those practices. It was tabled and carried unanimously last year. It remains the view of the government that that is the appropriate parliamentary expression on this issue. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. There is no question whatsoever that as at 1 July the manufacturing sector in Victoria will be under a very significant threat. That is a threat under the title of Campaign 2000, which is a campaign being run by certain left-wing unions to see the end of enterprise bargaining and the re-establishment of a system which was very expensive and costly for manufacturing back in the 1970s. In a sentence, the last thing that this country needs is a return to an old-style, confrontationist type of industrial politics run by the AMWU which will see a lot of investment leave that state.We have a development today. This arises out of orders made last year by the Industrial Relations Commission. They were to be enforced by the Federal Court and, in breach of those Federal Court orders, two leading unionists have been fined $20,000 each. Already one of those has defied the orders of the court and made it clear that he has no intention of complying with the further orders brought down today. This is typical, unfortunately, of some trade union leaders, who believe that they are above the law and able to thumb their noses at a court order. - This is what the judge said -  - Your challenge will be to stand up to these blokes because they have already paid out -  -  - It is a sensitive matter for the Labor Party because they have a choice to make. Either they uphold the law or they stand shoulder to shoulder with Craig Johnston. Members will remember Craig Johnston. He was at the front of the parliament knocking down the front doors and was subject to a fine for his behaviour - conduct which they have never repudiated because they would never have the ticker to stand up to these people. The judge said:The rule of law in a democratic society does not permit any member of that society, no matter how powerful, to pick and choose the laws or court orders that are to be observed and those that are not ... The fact that the breaches are by union leaders holding important offices in a federation of national trade unions makes them more, rather than less, serious ...He went on to say:Those union leaders who put applications to the court for injunctions against others should also have a responsibility to comply with orders when those orders are made against them.This is a clear signal to us all why it is important that this parliament pass further legislation to protect the manufacturing industry against the lawlessness which we can expect from people like Craig Johnson, supported by the Leader of the Opposition. The metals union is one of the biggest influences in the Socialist Left, yet the parliamentary Labor Party is clearly not prepared to stand up and block its strategy. Even though Rob Hulls, the Labor Attorney-General in Victoria, has already said that these fines were appropriate, we will not see the Labor Party in Canberra standing up to the AMWU. It is not as though they do not have $20,000. They had $1 million for the Labor Party in 1998. They can certainly afford to meet these fines, and the challenge on the Leader of the Opposition is, firstly, to support legislation in this parliament to protect the manufacturing industry; secondly, to stand up and call for compliance with a Federal Court order; and, lastly, to distance himself from those who are determined to pull down a policy which Labor in government supported but now does not have the ticker to stand up to - and, particularly, it does not have the ticker to stand up against the union. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point that I would make is that his claim in relation to the amount of money that we are spending on the introduction of a GST is highly misleading. As usual, these things should not be taken untested. The next point I would make is that the Commonwealth is engaged in a very significant program of infrastructure works on the national highway grid and so forth across Australia. In relation to infrastructure expenditure, perhaps I could pose a question to the member for Batman: why is it that his colleagues in New South Wales will not move on the $125 million that we have on the table to put a dedicated freight line through Sydney? It is sitting there, waiting for them to get on with the job so that we can spend the money. But the third thing I would ask is: if they are so committed to transport reform in this country, why will they not get behind the massive reductions in taxation that we are introducing for transport on 1 July?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, it gives me the opportunity to say a little more about the ALP and the management of resources in relation to infrastructure. I think I heard the Treasurer say a little while ago that you should never trust the ALP with money. Now I hear the member for Batman saying that another $306 million would be handy. I will come to that. It is ironic that he should have chosen that particular figure. As the member for Indi and the member for Farrer know, we committed ourselves to an internal bypass project in Albury-Wodonga on the national highway grid on the basis that it would cost about $200 million. In fact, the exact figure was $203 million. But guess what? We do indeed need another $306 million, due to the incompetence of the New South Wales government. Having quoted us $200 million, they now tell us it is going to cost half a billion dollars. It would be very nice indeed for the New South Wales government to have a bit of a look at how they handle it.Since 1998, the estimate of the Roads and Traffic Authority in New South Wales of $203 million for an internal bypass has blown out to the best part of $500 million. I find that quite an amazing performance. The RTA in New South Wales attributes these blow-outs to scope changes like drainage and noise barriers. But the minister explains it differently, and this reflects the ALP's capacity to manage money. In a letter to the Border Mail's editor, the Labor Minister for Transport, Carl Scully, explained the costing bungle - this is from $300 million to nearly half a billion in seven or eight months - like this:We ought to understand that in 1992 the price of a litre of milk was 98c. The cost of a loaf of bread was $1.55. A litre of milk now costs $1.31 and a loaf of bread costs $2.34.That is the explanation from a New South Wales minister. I sincerely hope he never runs a corner store. Under these circumstances, it is little wonder that the federal government questions the transport abilities of the New South Wales Labor government. It is little wonder that I resolved about 12 months ago, particularly after an incident in the member for New England's seat, that we have to have a close look at the RTA's performance and how they cost things. In this case, we have now been forced to review the entire project. We have been left with no choice at all and will appoint an independent auditor to oversee any further work that the RTA undertakes on the Hume Highway upgrade at Albury-Wodonga. When you put it all together, when you take the RTA's performance under Mr Scully's stewardship and add to it the New South Wales rail transport problems - everything from derailments to disruption on the CityRail network - you have to wonder just who is in the drivers seat and how long they ought to stay there. </DOC>

As well as increased expenditure for dependency, there is a further $66 million of new program spending. I would remind the House that, when we took over, the Labor Party left us 10,000 places short. They are not my figures; they are the Auditor-General's figures. In this current round, I have announced that there will be 14,777 new places.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The simple fact is that we have had a fantastic result in the March quarter with the private health insurance figures, with an extra 187,000 Australians taking out private health insurance. This is the largest increase for at least 20 years, probably ever, and it is the fifth consecutive quarterly increase since we introduced the 30 per cent rebate. The good news for the honourable member is that the biggest increase was in the age group of 30- to 34-year-olds, and these are the people who are taking a long-term commitment now to private health insurance.Since the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate, nearly half a million extra Australians have taken out private health insurance, and today 32.7 per cent of the population is covered by private health insurance. You get credit and compliments from odd places, but I can tell the honourable member that probably the best compliment the government got was last week when a commentator said:I've got to say, well done, because that is a big improvement, better than it used to be and good luck to them.Thank you very much, Graham Richardson.</DOC>

 - No, I am going to take this one. I could not restrain myself from saying something about this rather extraordinary proposition that is being advanced in a series of questions by the opposition that in some way the figure of some $360 million is in order to promote, as they call it, in some PR fashion the new taxation system. I want to make it very plain on behalf of the government that we do not apologise at all for spending money to explain a new taxation system. We do not apologise at all. To start with, of the $360 million, $134 million was to provide information on the new GST, the Australian business number and the pay-as-you-go systems. - As the Treasurer interrupts, many of those measures have the support of the Australian Labor Party. There is $200 million provided for the GST Start-up Office, including $150 million for organisation delivered assistance. More than 120 organisations have received funds from this scheme, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and they did not send it back; the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission; the Australian Taxi Association; and the Tourism Council of Australia. A further $12 million is for the ACCC education program. Over the past few months, there has been a constant pattern of Labor Party propaganda against the GST that there is not enough detail out there and that the government has not explained it to the Australian public. - We haven't, he says now. When attempts are made by the government to explain in detail how this new taxation system will operate, the government is very strongly attacked. Everyone knows that this is the biggest single change to the Australian taxation system undertaken by any government since Federation. In those circumstances, we have an obligation to explain to the Australian public how the new system works. You have absolutely no right to foist on the Australian public a taxation system involving these changes - the biggest change to our indirect taxation system, a huge change to the business taxation system, the biggest ever personal income tax changes, massive changes to the way business operates -  - I can assure the member for Werriwa that there is a lot of information in the campaign about the new child-care benefits; I can assure him. But, in looking at some of the allegations that have been made against the government in relation to this matter, I came across a quote as follows:For some time the Government has been conducting a public information campaign on various aspects of the tax reform package. Consistent with that duty to keep the public informed about changes in the tax system and administration, the Australian Taxation Office has already produced television, radio, newspaper and printed material and other items ...That was uttered in October 1986 by the then Treasurer of Australia -  - who had introduced changes to the taxation system that were absolutely minute compared with these changes. He had been rolled by his Prime Minister on the subject of major change to the Australian taxation system. He had wanted to do then that which we have now had the political courage to do 12 years later.It is entirely appropriate that, with a change of this magnitude, public funds be employed to explain the detail of the changes. Nothing the Labor Party has said on the subject alters that fundamental truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. Education spending under the Howard government has reached a record, with $11.6 billion being available for education in this year 2000-01. This represents a boost of some $382 million over the previous year for education expenditure.I am aware of comments that Australia is, in fact, disinvesting in education. Those comments occurred in the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the budget speech. He argued that Commonwealth spending on education was 1.8 per cent of GDP this year and had declined from 2.2 per cent five years ago. Mr Speaker, you would have to say that there was a reasonably small chance that this statement by the Leader of the Opposition was correct because, whenever he gives himself over to some factual comment on education, he is invariably wrong. - We remember the policy that he introduced at the last election campaign that was so bad and so full of errors that the shadow minister for education resigned on the strength of it and went to the back bench. - We remember his recent announcement of the opposition's goal on education being that 90 per cent of school leavers would have a post-school qualification. That turned out to be a slight exaggeration from the current figure of 12 per cent and it was later revised.Mr Speaker, when you look closely at the Leader of the Opposition's figures, you find that they are completely incorrect - that the 2.2 per cent of GDP quoted by the Leader of the Opposition as representing Commonwealth expenditure five years ago included Austudy. Since then, of course, there has been a major reform: the youth allowance has been introduced. The youth allowance was placed in the Department of Social Security; it is no longer in those education figures. That explains the difference between the 2.2 per cent five years ago and the 1.8 per cent today. This was sheer carelessness on the part of the Leader of the Opposition - sheer carelessness.  - Where did he get this figure from? He got it from the press release of the member for Dobell. - The member for Dobell presumably got it from the Australian Education Union. Sharan Burrow, Shazza, has now gone on to bigger things, but she has been replaced by Denis Fitzgerald - and Dezza is no more reliable than Shazza was. As a source of information, the Australian Education Union is hopeless. The Leader of the Opposition ought to know that he should never rely on the member for Dobell for facts about education. He should have had the commonsense to check this figure before including it in his speech. It was not a minor statistic just in passing in the speech; this was the fundamental fact on which the Leader of the Opposition based his claim - his false claim, his fallacious claim - that Australia was disinvesting in education.  - The correct figure is now 1.9 per cent, not 2.2 per cent. Therefore, there has been essentially no change whatever in the investment in education. Indeed, because GDP has been growing so rapidly, there has been a 15 per cent real increase in Commonwealth spending on education since 1994-95; schools spending has risen as a proportion of GDP from 0.65 per cent to 0.73 per cent of GDP. In other words, the Commonwealth is increasing its investment in education; it is making a massive investment in education. It is the sheer laziness and incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition that led him to base his claims on a completely fallacious statistic.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about a mail-out in relation to the GST. There will be a mail-out with a booklet in relation to the GST, yes. There will be, and that is a perfectly legitimate part of the campaign. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when he was a member of the Hawke government, he was perfectly happy to have a booklet sent to every household to explain superannuation changes. - Mr Speaker, I was asked a question about a mail-out. The answer is, yes, there will be a mail-out, just as there was in relation to superannuation. Was that paid for by the Australian Labor Party? No. There were booklets showing money literally growing on trees. It was one of the most outrageous advertisements ever funded by the Australian taxpayers. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his extraordinarily high level of interest in banking, particularly banking services in rural and regional areas, and the work that he and his committee have put into issues pertaining to some of the problems that country people are currently or have been facing in terms of face-to-face services and other service delivery matters. In that report to which he referred, amongst other things there was a recommendation that Australia Post giroPost services should be extended to include business banking services. I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that, as a result of a joint pilot scheme between the Commonwealth Bank and Australia Post, a significant number of centres across Australia, such as Merriwa, Bombala, Walcha, Cann River, Mallacoota, Barcaldine, Hughenden, Kingscote, Tennant Creek and Halls Creek - a whole range right across Australia - will in fact now be able to assess the value of that recommendation under which business banking services, including cash and cheque deposits, overnight credits to customers' accounts, withdrawals and one-stop convenience for bill payment, business and personal banking and postal needs, will be able to be trialled. It is a three-month trial. I am optimistic, as indeed are, I understand, both the Commonwealth Bank and Australia Post, that this will work very well. It offers a lot of benefits. For example, when I opened the pilot at Merriwa a few days ago, I was amazed to see the number of institutions that would receive payments at that post office for their services; they included, as a matter of interest, even the United States embassy.Let us hope that that new service really does work. It does represent an innovative and practical way of putting into small rural communities much needed services that either have existed and have been withdrawn or have never been there. It offers opportunities for them to hang onto businesses that currently exist, enhance those businesses, and perhaps attract new businesses. So it is the picking up in a practical way of one of the recommendations from the standing committee. I note in passing that, since June last year, we have seen another 50 post office outlets open across Australia - 30 of them in rural and regional areas. That contrasts with the last six years of the Labor government when nearly 300 postal outlets were lost. With the addition of new post offices, this new range of services under the pilot program and, of course, the rural transaction centres - there are now some 200 communities involved in that very innovative program put together by the federal government - you can see that there are some very worthwhile enhancements to services developing in rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. We did have some numbers out in the last couple of weeks on industrial disputes. I would have to say that the February figures are not good numbers compared with 1999 or earlier, so we have been having a look at why the February figures are up.  - Ninety-two per cent of the total number of days lost in February can be attributed to three states - Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, all of which are Labor states. Opposition members - Oh!  - Well, wait till you hear. The facts tell a pretty stark story. Where were the trouble spots? In Victoria it was the green light the construction industry got and the electricity dispute was part of the problem. That was a failure by the state Labor government. Then in New South Wales there were problems. Where do we find a lot of those working days lost? With the teachers - Shazza's lot. In Queensland, where were a lot of those disputes? They had a transport dispute with Queensland Rail - again, mismanagement by a Labor government. When you pull out the year figures through to February of this year, again you will see that it is exactly the same problem. There is clearly a pattern emerging. If those increases had not occurred, particularly in New South Wales, 1999 would have actually been better than 1998. Therefore, what we are seeing is a lift in those figures in 1999 and it is all directly attributable to mismanagement by state Labor governments. I can at least say that in the time that this government has been in office compared with when Labor was in office we still have a lot fewer disputes. It is much better under this government. Under this government the average number of working days lost per 1,000 employees is 78; when Labor was in it was 190 days. Under us it is 78; Labor averaged 190. So it is much better. It is better because we are prepared to stand up and require people to observe the law. Labor's policy is to do a Queensland, according to the shadow minister. In Queensland you are getting a rise in disputes because you have a Labor government. It just proves, starkly and clearly for all to see, that Labor parties cannot manage these issues and that if you vote Labor you get a higher number of industrial disputes. It demonstrates that if you have weak leadership, which is what we have today -  - Well, you can't even stand up to Craig Johnston. Let's face it. He pushes you around. They buy you off with $1 million and the consequences are more disputes which wreck Australia's international reputation. </DOC>

It seems to me that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others who are critical of the difference between the increase in the price of packaged beer - and I am informed that packaged beer through bottle shops comprises some 70 to 75 per cent of aggregate beer sales in Australia - have overlooked the fact that there is a service component in the delivery of -  - I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is programmed to laugh whenever we give a response - this nervous sort of laugh whenever we give a response to his question.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise not only the importance to his constituency in expanding our export potential to China but also his interest in China itself. In the last couple of weeks we have seen some significant progress made in terms of moving China towards becoming a member of the WTO. In fact, while I was leading a delegation of 70 Australian businessmen and women to China in the last 10 days, we saw the European Union conclude their market access negotiations with China. Then last week we saw the US Congress pass the PNTR legislation, which finally cleared the last hurdle as far as the US acceptance of China as a member of the WTO is concerned. Of course, once China becomes a member of the WTO, it is going to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year to Australian exporters and to the Australian economy in improved market access to that marketplace. Our deal that we negotiated with China that was started by my predecessor, the member for Farrer, was concluded last week when I signed the formal agreement with Minister Shi.There are some good examples of Australian commodities that will benefit from this deal. For instance, the great Australian wine industry will see greater market access into China, with a reduction in tariffs from 60 per cent to 14 per cent; Australian beef will see reductions from 45 per cent to 15 per cent; butter will see reductions from 30 per cent to 10 per cent; and citrus will see reductions from 40 per cent to 12 per cent. These are very significant in terms of the access that we are getting into that marketplace. Just as importantly, while I was in China I had the honour of participating in a number of agreement signing ceremonies with Australian companies - and not just primary producing companies - in terms of their exports to China. For example, an Australian company based in Newcastle called Long-Airdox signed a major deal worth $10 million for Australian coal washing equipment to be exported to China; Muirfield, a Victorian company, is being engaged to participate in environmental revegetation along the Yangtze River; and Cootamundra Oilseeds has signed a contract worth tens of millions of dollars to provide oilseeds to a market in southern China. These are all important developments as far as Australia's exporters are concerned.We have energetically supported the accession of China into the WTO. It seems now that it is definitely going to take place, with the passing of the PNTR bill in the US House of Representatives last week - unfortunately, at the same time as the US House passed a bill to hand out another $7.1 billion to US farmers in domestic subsidies, which will make it very difficult for our farmers in the international trading markets of the world. This is why it is important that we continue to increase the membership of the WTO and to focus on improving the rules and disciplines so that we can bring equity and more discipline into international farm trade in the face of the high levels of unfair support that is provided to farmers by some of our major trading partners. The deal that has been done with China is important, and one that will see us add hundreds of millions of dollars worth of exports to our export effort and provide many more hundreds of jobs in exporting industries across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for canvassing a number of issues here. As the honourable member knows, the Fiji military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, last night declared martial law and we understand, although we are not entirely sure, that President Mara has stepped aside to allow martial law to be imposed. We are not quite certain of that, but that would appear to be the case. We understand that President Ratu Mara is safe and on a patrol boat which is sailing off the coast of Fiji.In answer to one part of the honourable member's question, officials from the Australian High Commission in Suva met this morning with the commander of the Fiji military force, Commodore Bainimarama, and the official who met with the chief stressed this government's strong view that there must be a swift return to democratic rule and that Australia and the international community were watching developments closely. Bainimarama noted the comments. He said he well understood this, and he disclaimed any interest in participating in government and did say that he would move to appoint a civilian interim government to work towards either a new or an amended constitution and possibly fresh elections.Commodore Bainimarama has initiated contact, I understand, with the Speight group and would appear to be taking a firm line with them, demanding the surrender of weapons and accepting no conditions in return, although there is a possibility that he may be prepared to grant amnesty to Speight and to the six original colleagues who took the Prime Minister and other ministers hostage. The situation at the parliamentary compound so far appears to remain unchanged, although the security has been tightened and there are reports of Speight's supporters trickling away, and the army is apparently optimistic about an end to the stand-off. This military takeover graphically underlines the depth of the crisis created by the criminal actions of Speight and his group. We do take some, albeit very limited, encouragement from reports that the military has assumed control purely for the purpose of restoring law and order and that it does plan to return the country to civilian rule as soon as possible.In answer to another part of the honourable member's question, both we and the New Zealand government think that the wise thing to do at the moment is to withhold final judgments - and, importantly, I urge the honourable member to reflect on this - until the hostage situation is resolved. The Prime Minister, a number of ministers and others are still being held at gunpoint, and I think the international community needs to take that factor very significantly into consideration. I can only say that. Obviously, the honourable member knows only too well that this government is prepared to take strong measures, and we outlined a list of them yesterday. But I do think it is important that we focus on one thing at a time, and the thing to focus on at the moment is to try to get those hostages released, including, after all, the Prime Minister of the country. Nevertheless, what has happened remains a fundamental denial of democratic values. The elected government has, it would appear, been forced from office initially by an act of terrorism. Let me say this: the inclusion of Speight and his supporters in any government in Fiji would be intolerable to Australia. Australia has outlined measures, as I said yesterday, and, as I also explained yesterday, we would put those in place unless constitutional government is restored. Let me make one final point, because the honourable member argues that we should also have imposed tougher economic sanctions. This of course at the end of the day is a matter of judgment. It is not our judgment, and I am sure it is not the judgment of the coalition parties or the New Zealand parliament and other governments around the world, that we should destroy the Fijian economy. That is not our judgment. I think that would be a profoundly unwise thing to do because, quite apart from the immense harm it would do to all Fijians, it would also suck down the economies of other neighbouring countries like Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga and Samoa, and I do not think Australia would be well regarded around the world if we were to do that.   - The honourable member interjects, `Are you against sanctions?' How childish can you get? We announced yesterday a whole list of measures, a whole list of sanctions. And what have you been doing for the last 24 hours? Read the newspapers, because even you might understand. This is not an issue on which I would suggest the Australian Labor Party make party political points. It is too important an issue. It is an issue that gets to the heart of the South Pacific's interests, including our national interest, and it is not a game. I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in particular that he rise above game playing, even for a minute.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. As one who represents many farmers, he would be, like other members of the government, horrified by the announcement that the US Congress have agreed to a new level of subsidies for American farmers totalling $US15.3 billion - that is around $A28 billion. That is a $28 billion subsidy program approved by the United States in an endeavour to further insulate their farmers from the realities of the world market. Once again, it demonstrates the double standards that the United States display when dealing with trade issues. Whilst they are very bold and aggressive in giving advice to the rest of the world, when it comes to their own marketplace they do very little and in fact increase their levels of subsidies. It is of some concern that this new level of congressional support, if signed off by the President, will in fact result in there being actually a higher level of subsidies available to US farmers now than when the original GATT agreement was signed by those opposite a few years ago. The US government lawyers have found ways to get around the system and to manipulate the arrangements so that they can continue to supply very high levels of support. There are many farmers in Australia who are, naturally, concerned. When they face levels of difficulty and they see people in other parts of the world receiving higher levels of subsidy, they may sometimes ask, `Why can't Australia match those levels of subsidies?' There are a couple of reasons why we cannot. It is obvious, firstly, that Australian taxpayers and the Australian Treasury can never hope to win a subsidy battle with the mighty treasuries of Europe and the United States. But there is another underlying problem, and that is that the GATT agreement signed by Labor specifically gives advantages to the US farmers over Australian farmers. The agreement gives a much higher level of permitted support to US farmers than to Australian farmers. To give you an illustration, the maximum aggregate level of support that is allowed to US farmers under the agreement signed by Labor is the equivalent of $15,227 per farmer - that is allowed under the GATT agreement - whereas, under that same agreement, the maximum level of subsidy that Australia could provide is $4,000. So, under this world trade agreement, US farmers are actually entitled, without us being able to take any action, to subsidy levels four times those that can be provided in Australia.We will be looking very closely at these latest US measures to check that they do fit within the WTO rules; that what is being done now is legitimate. If they do not, we will take them to the WTO, as we did in the lamb case. We will be mounting solid action if any of these actions are perceived to be outside of the measures that the Labor Party signed off on when the GATT agreement came into being. In the longer term, the Minister for Trade is working hard to get us a better trade deal for the future, but Australian farmers can look well and truly back to the days of Labor to see the level of subsidies that they signed off on to support US farmers. </DOC>

 - The procedures for dealing with these matters are well known. I have not involved myself in all of the minutiae of these arrangements, but they have been carried out in a totally aboveboard fashion. Of course, I have agreed to send a personally signed letter. - I agreed at the appropriate time to sign a letter. I have on all occasions behaved appropriately, and appropriate procedures have been followed. May I say, as I am on my feet, that this question passes strange from a party that when it was in office indulged itself in an almost compulsive way in advertising a government policy. Any tiny, little measure from the Labor Party merited a bit of taxpayer funded advertising. You would have thought on occasions that money grew on trees, when it came to the Australian Labor Party.Indeed, I came across an advertisement that appeared in the Sunday Telegraph on 3 September 1995, when time was fast running out for the Keating government. It was advertising the new arrangement and it quite literally invited the Australian public to believe that the superannuation arrangement actually represented money growing on trees. That was in fact the kind of advertisement that was represented all around the country. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the right procedures have been followed. It is very necessary, and is what we have been constantly exhorted to do. As recently as 24 January 2000, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was interviewed on 3AW and said this:All right. Look, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer - people want answers. They want to know how this tax is going to apply.He said that people want answers - and he keeps nodding his head. - I have, and I have finished my answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. He would know, as most members of the House would know, that there are special benefits for pensioners, arising out of the new tax system. On 1 July this year, pensions will increase by four per cent. Normally, a pension is indexed in March and September of each year but on 1 July there is a four per cent increase in pensions, and then we go to the indexation in September and in the following March. As a result of the changes the government is putting in place, there is a 2½ per cent increase in the income and assets test-free area for pensioners. Pensioners are also able to keep an extra 10c of their pension for every dollar of private income that they earn. Under the Labor Party you lost 50c in the dollar, if you were a pensioner, for every dollar that you earned. That taper test is being cut to 40c. The increase of four per cent in pensions is not just compensation for the tax changes. It represents a real increase in the pension. I hear the Labor Party interjecting, but I have had confirmation of that point from a rather spooky source. It has been confirmed in a document which is called `GST Information Kit', published by Simon Crean, member for Hotham. It has a rather spooky photo on the front of it: a sort of shady character looking out from darkness -  - The information kit says this:I am making this kit available to you not because I support the GST but because there is a need to try to sort out some of the confusion and explain how the GST will operate.Then he says this:The government is leaving people in the dark - This is the man who is against advertising, complaining that the government is leaving people in the dark! Anyway, in this rather spooky document which masquerades as an information kit and has a falsehood on every page, I had to get to page 26 before I read a factual claim. Listen to this. In the information kit of the spooky member for Hotham, Mr Crean, he said:The real increase in the pension will therefore be two per cent.A `real increase' in the pension. Let me explain what a real increase in the pension means. It means an increase in the pension over and above the increase in prices - which gives you, in real terms above inflation, an increase in your income. Let me make this clear, and it comes not only from this side of the House but is also endorsed by the Labor Party: if the new tax system were not coming into effect on 1 July, there would be no real increase in pensions. There would be no real increase in pensions under Labor policy. There would be no real increase in pensions if tax reform were not being accomplished. There has only been a real increase in pensions because this government was decent enough to give the pensioners a go and to give them a two per cent increase under the coalition plan, as endorsed now by the Australian Labor Party.Although they purport to be giving out their own information, I think one of their main objections to the government information campaign is that it exposes the kind of misunderstandings that they like to put around in those booklets. This is what the shadow Treasurer claimed about the government's advertising yesterday; this is the shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, talking of the government ads:The ads also claim that everyone will be worse off when in fact they will not be, he said of the government's claims.`When in fact they will not be'. He was half right: they will not be worse off. But he was half wrong: the government's ads do not claim that everybody will be worse off. That is a claim that is made in that kind of false information which is put around by the Australian Labor Party because they are so opposed to a GST which, after 30 June this year, they intend to keep.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that many people in this place are very interested in rail, and they will be delighted to know - and I know that the Minister for Finance and Administration joins me in this good news - that the joint sale of National Rail is about to commence. Indeed, we anticipate that it will be completed by the middle of 2001. It has taken quite a while to get there. It took more than a little effort to ensure that we had the agreement of all shareholders to the sale management agreements under which the sale will now take place. The sale of NR is a key plank in the government's rail reform program. It will facilitate greater private sector investment and participation, and I have no doubt at all that that is absolutely critical to increasing the competitiveness of rail in this country.There are a couple of points I would like to make in relation to some of the speculation that is around at the moment. Firstly, a key objective of the sale will be to ensure that a privatised NR contributes to an efficient and viable domestic freight transport industry and, secondly, the Commonwealth government's policy position is that rail reform would be best served by the sale of NR to private sector bidders, and sale management agreements have been put together on this basis. Details of the tender process will be released shortly, and if there are potential investors listening or present, I would encourage them to contact the Office of Asset Sales.There is no doubt that the evidence is well and truly in: rail privatisation highlights the benefit of greater private sector investment in rail. Interestingly enough, Tasrail, in its now private form, has become profitable for the first time in 130 years. Freight Australia will invest $35 million in 2000. It is reopening closed branch lines, which is a new story in this country. Australian National, it needs to be remembered, suffered massive losses - hundreds of millions of dollars - when the ALP ran it. It was constantly being propped up while it offered ever declining services and lost more and more of the freight task in this country. The comment was made yesterday, `Never trust the ALP when it comes to managing money.' Since this government's sale of AN, after an appalling record when the ALP ran it, do you know what has happened to freight rates on the east-west corridor of this country? They have come down by 40 per cent. That is real reform. That is the private sector investing in a climate where they know that competent, competitive management is going to be allowed to flourish, in contrast with the sorts of massive job losses, massive taxpayer subsidies and ill-conceived investment plans that we saw under Labor. The way they have approached this is perhaps best summed up by quoting Bob Hawke who said in 1983:I promise you that only the Labor government can be trusted to build the Alice Springs-Darwin railway.</DOC>

 - I agree with the questioner on one point, and that is that people want more information about tax changes - I must say, a point which he himself made in his spooky little document saying the government needs to give out more information - and that is why the government is doing that. On the one hand the Labor Party would say, `People want more information,' but `the last thing the government should ever do is advertise and give it out,' because at the end of the day -  - This is the largest tax change in Australian history. It is probably the largest legislative change in Australian history. I gave out the figures yesterday. From memory, there are about 1.4 million businesses registered for GST. There are now 2.1 to 2.2 million people registered for the Australian business number. The government is ensuring that all of those businesses have adequate information in relation to their obligations. A big part of that is television advertising, which the Australian Labor Party apparently opposes. A big part of that is a $200 voucher which businesses can use to get advice. A big part of that is $200 million which has been given to industry organisations so that they can give up answers. I notice the Australian Labor Party includes that $200 million which was given to industry organisations as part of the so-called advertising campaign - an entirely false claim. It was given to industry organisations, including organisations such as the ACTU, the Salvation Army, the Australian Council of Social Service and St Vincent de Paul, which the Australian Labor Party apparently claims is part of an advertising campaign. The commissioner, in my view - notwithstanding the attacks which have been made on him by the Labor Party, amongst others - has done a very strong job. It was widely said that the registrations would not be in in time. They have exceeded the estimates. He has set up a program whereby people can visit businesses if they want more information. - Those businesses that want further information can have a visit from a member of the Taxation Office, a program which has been very warmly received. They have advice available from their industry associations, a program of $200 million in relation to them. They have the information brochures, which are on the web site. They have the ability to get more information. I do agree with the Labor Party that more information is required, and that is why the government will be continuing its advertising program.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he is an active member of the government committee on workplace relations, and I thank him and the chairman and others on the committee for the support that they have given for the development of this policy to help workers. I am very pleased to be able to advise the House that in the last few working days my department has provided funds to the receiver of Scone meatworks for the payment of funds under the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme. This scheme commenced on 1 January. As at 25 May 2000, 507 employees had put in claims under the scheme, relating to 69 separate business collapses. My department is working as quickly as it can to ensure these payments are made. I am also pleased to be able to say that I will tomorrow go to Scone, with Senator John Tierney as a local representative, to meet with those workers to advise them of the scheme, the payments that have been made and the implementation of this policy. When I speak with those workers tomorrow I will be the first minister of any federal government to ever talk with workers on the basis that there is a national scheme in place to actually provide these workers with some assistance.As at the time of their termination, with the full implementation of the scheme, those workers would receive approximately 80 per cent of the entitlements that they are owed. If you put to one side the payments which were made by the company at termination, or shortly thereafter, an average of 66 per cent of the entitlements can be met under the scheme. Unfortunately, that will not, however, be the case in respect of Scone meatworkers. That is because, whilst it was acknowledged by the New South Wales government that it had a shared responsibility, the New South Wales government is not prepared to lift a finger to help these workers - even though I have a letter from the Minister for Gaming and Racing, the Hon. Richard Face, a member of the Carr government from New South Wales, asking me to ensure that Scone Fresh Meats' meatworkers are included in any package offered to retrenched workers. So I have a member of Mr Carr's government seeking federal support for these workers, when the New South Wales Labor Party is not prepared to do a thing for these workers. And there are a lot of New South Wales Labor Party members sitting in this chamber today who do not give one second thought to the interests of these workers.It is not only the New South Wales Labor government; the Victorian Labor government are prepared to spend $5 million on an inquiry into their industrial relations system, but they are not prepared to do a thing for workers in the state of Victoria. And here in the federal parliament, the Labor Party are opposed to our scheme. They are opposed to our providing these funds to these workers. The Labor Party have no genuine costed alternative to the national scheme. The federal Labor Party have not bothered to gather any support from the state Labor parties with whom they are in cahoots for the establishment of an alternative national scheme. When you ask the federal Labor Party to stand up for these workers and make representations to Bob Carr, not one of them is prepared to publicly criticise Bob Carr for not being prepared to do anything for these workers. They are simply not prepared to do anything for people who are genuinely in need of support. Not only are they not prepared to criticise Bob Carr but they write to me saying that we should look after these workers. The member for Shortland wrote to me, obviously supporting the scheme although that is not her party's policy, asking me to extend it. I have a letter from the member for Fowler asking me for speedy consideration for a worker and payment to that worker, but she is not prepared to say anything to Bob Carr.The member for Holt went 26 times better - he sent me 26 applications. Fair enough; he is prepared to do something for those workers by sending in the applications, but he is not prepared to demand that his own front bench have a policy that would actually support those workers. I challenge him to stand up to Steve Bracks and demand that the Victorian Labor Party do something for these workers.  The member for Hunter - and I am sorry he does not seem to be here today - wrote to me on 8 February putting to me a proposition, which he obviously endorses, from the Cessnock City Council. He seeks `a fair and equitable package to protect employee entitlements, backdated to January 1' - which of course is exactly what we have done. He goes on to relay the views of the Cessnock City Council, and he urges `state and federal governments to work cooperatively to ensure that an appropriate system is put in place,' and yet he is not prepared to say that to Bob Carr. He is prepared to say it to us, but he is not prepared to challenge the state Labor governments who will not lift a finger for workers. Lastly, just to cap it off, my shadow, the member for Brisbane - the not often seen Arch; is he here? - wrote to me in September last year and said, `The Labor Party is ready to play a constructive part in the process of protecting employee entitlements.' The fact is that the Labor Party is not prepared to do a thing for workers; not a thing. You have not been prepared to put a decent policy in, you will not stand up to Bob Carr, you will not stand up to Steve Bracks, you just roll over whenever the unions tell you to. I say to the Labor Party: put aside your cheap party political tricks and your cheap posturing. For once why don't you, in the national interest and in the interests of workers, stand up for a policy that genuinely will help Australian workers?</DOC>

 - That question just demonstrates that if you keep on talking, eventually you talk yourself into trouble, and that is exactly what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done. Of course I remember what I said to that French business audience, and of course I have seen a summary of the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index. Amongst other things, it reveals that a majority of small businesses remain in favour of the goods and services tax. In fact, the number of people in favour actually increased. The takeout of that survey is very clear, and that is that they want more information. That is exactly so. Am I and the Treasurer and our other colleagues on the front bench entitled to construe from the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party would support the expenditure of further resources on providing more information to the Australian public about the new taxation system? I try to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition credit for endeavouring to construct some kind of logical case.  - If you keep asking questions about providing more information, and if you complain because the replyin5 service is being - dare I say it - overtaxed because of the volume of inquiries, all of that amounts to in effect saying, `We want not only more information but more resources devoted to providing more information.' That sounds to me not only like a ringing endorsement of the government's information campaign, it sounds to me very much like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asking us to commit more resources. Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, when you get at your address in Hotham the booklet explaining the GST, if you believe that further information is required, give me a call, or get Chris to give me a call, and I would be very happy to provide you with more information. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am delighted to know that the Labor Party wants more information. We are only too happy to provide it. We think at the moment the level of information is enough, but in order to maintain a bipartisan approach we will continue to monitor the situation - and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  -  - I gather I have misled the House. The Treasurer reminds me that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's mailbox is not in Hotham. I apologise for that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. This year the total number of domestic Australian students in higher education will be an estimated 464,700 full-time equivalent students, which is a staggering 42,000 more students than in Labor's last year in office. That means that this government has added the equivalent of two substantially sized universities to the university system in the last five years. Even the New South Wales Left, whose notorious branch stacking in Werriwa and Fowler is well known, would be proud of these numbers. And, unlike the new ALP branch members, these are real students, they are alive and they have signed their own applications. These additional places have come into existence because this government has been prepared to pay universities for additional students above their fully funded load - something the Labor Party was never prepared to do - and to free up opportunities for fee paying places so that Australian students have the same rights of access to universities as overseas students. As a result of that, universities will get an extra $49 million for overenrolments in 1999. We have seen postgraduate numbers up four per cent and fee paying undergraduate places up 92 per cent. These results do not just happen. - They require a government that is prepared to work hard to expand opportunities for qualified university students. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition was education minister, he spent his time telling university applicants to go somewhere else, because he did not have the ticker to put in place the policies that would open the doors to qualified students. What did the supporter of the Knowledge Nation say when he was minister for education? I quote the Age of 28 February 1992: `The desperation to get into higher education is really misplaced,' said the Leader of the Opposition.Another quote:`Mr Beazley said that Australia had 'unquestionably reached a point' where people's expectations about entering a university had to change.' `We are approaching the limits of our capacity to continue to expand publicly funded university places.' In other words, his message to qualified students was: `Get lost! Don't bother applying for university because we've said there aren't enough places in Australian universities.' I quote from the Australian of 25 October 1993: `We're going to have to cap university expansion.' The Leader of the Opposition, when he was education minister, gave up on opening the doors to qualified Australian students. The fraudulent advocate of the Knowledge Nation, when he was put to the test, found it all too difficult, it was all too hard, and the easiest message was to say no more opportunities, no more places, for Australian students. The Howard government's increase of 42,000 university enrolments over Labor's is 42,000 more reasons why the Leader of the Opposition will never make a credible education leader. </DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Shortland's question, I certainly do stand by the distribution and the analysis which was put in the A New Tax System booklet put out in August 1998. There was modelling on over 130 industry sectors. The modelling which has been done by the ACCC has broken down numbers of those and has itemised subcomponents of some of those 134 or so ABS statistics. One of the most obvious areas where Labor Party intransigence has pushed up the price of clothing was when the Labor Party voted against the government's mandate in the Senate and forced a $3 billion hole to be belted through the revenue base. One of the things that the government had to do was delay for 12 months the abolition of financial institutions duty, and it had to delay for a number of years the abolition of the bank account debits tax. So, when modelling is now done on ANTS as amended, indirect taxes are still paid not only by clothing manufacturers, transporters and wholesalers but also by retailers.One of the changes that the Australian Labor Party forced in the absolute genius of its opposition in the Senate was the continuation of indirect tax changes, which could have been abolished much earlier. That is one of the reasons why additional costs flow right back into the clothing sector. We would be more interested in the question if the questioner had said that she supported the abolition of financial institutions duty and bank account debits tax. If she supported the abolition of financial institutions duty and bank account debits tax, it would make clothing a lot cheaper, but she supports their continuation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and for his support of the four recent Work for the Dole projects announced in his electorate. I am aware of a recent speech. It was a rare and welcome event - a Labor frontbencher giving a scripted speech on a portfolio issue which was not completely and utterly devoid of policy content. When I saw the title of the speech of the shadow minister for employment, `The Phantom Menace', I thought perhaps she was talking about her relationship with Dickson. Perhaps that is where she is today. In fact, she was calling for the Job Network to be totally reconstructed in the image and likeness of the former government's Working Nation program. The `phantom menace', she said, was `the lack of guaranteed quality training available to the unemployed under the Job Network'. In other words, she wants to dictate to Job Network members exactly what they can and cannot do under this program. She wants to change everything about the Job Network except the name. She wants to change Job Network members from independent agencies delivering services according to their professional judgments into mere servants of the government.Nevertheless, I congratulate the member for Dickson for so clearly setting out her position and for so clearly differentiating it from that of the government. Unfortunately, her preoccupation with training for training's sake also puts her sharply at odds with her senior colleagues. The Leader of the Opposition knows that training is not everything because when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training he received a SkillShare evaluation report stating that structured training did not improve job seekers' employment prospects. The distinguished member for Melbourne knows that training is not everything because in his book, Open Australia, he said that Working Nation training programs had `led to perverse outcomes with some unemployed people forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training'. Training is important, and that is why the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has boosted traineeships and apprenticeships to record numbers. That is why apprenticeship and traineeship commencements have almost tripled since 1995. But training is not the only thing and, for many job seekers, it is not nearly as important as the job search skills and positive work culture which Job Network is providing. The member for Melbourne knows that. Very recently, in the foreword to the book Tales From the New Shop Floor, the member for Melbourne has written:In most cases the skills involved - that is to say, in the modern work force - are fluid, always evolving and adapting, often under-recognised, and rarely attributable to formal education.That is what the member for Melbourne says. He continues:Solving problems, coordinating different activities, serving customers, responding quickly to client needs and managing effective communications all require skills which are almost absorbed rather than learned.That is what the member for Melbourne thinks. Why then is the opposition so committed to training for training's sake? - It is very simple. The unions are committed to training for training's sake - just as they are committed to the union bloc vote and just as they are committed to the socialisation objective. It is 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the Leader of the Opposition in this, as in all other things, lacks the ticker to just say no.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for Riverina, who has a very strong commitment to families. The government's Stronger Families and Stronger Communities policies are all about a positive contribution to Australian families. They are new policy areas of prevention and early intervention, particularly for families at risk. - These benefits include new money of $240 million which will go to assisting families at risk, which the Labor Party did not have before. That is $40 million to the Stronger Families fund, $47 million to better parenting and early intervention strategies, $65 million to further child-care facilities and flexibility - again, which Labor never had - and $20 million going towards extended studies into childhood over the next nine years. The Stronger Families and Stronger Communities strategies are not only working with business and with government but also working with local communities. The coalition government recognises that local communities will drive a lot of these programs, not just the bureaucrats and certainly not the ACTU.These measures have been applauded by ACOSS, the Australian Federation of Homeless Organisations and Relationships Australia, to name a few. Let us contrast this with Labor's hypocrisy. Recently, they produced a discussion paper - yes, not a policy paper, a discussion paper. Let me quote:Our approach to family policy will be about putting the heart back in our society by bringing families back into the centre of our policy considerations.So Labor have finally admitted they have never had families in their policies. Where is their heart? They have never had a heart. The coalition government do have a heart, and we have real policies for that. Let us look at some of the other considerations in this paper. They are out of touch. They talk about these early intervention programs - policies that we already have. They talk about the extended program of studies that they are doing in Europe or America, but they do not mention the studies in Australia. They do not mention our own programs, particularly the new Good Beginnings program. They have no new ideas, and they are promoting actual government policies. The bottom line is that this flimsy discussion paper is actually an endorsement of our policy. - I table the Labor Party's flimsy document. - Mr Speaker, some of the documents I had were confidential, and I have tabled the Labor Party document on their policies for discussion.</DOC>

 - I certainly do not agree with that letter from the Launceston Examiner, because the Launceston Examiner will receive numerous benefits from tax changes. Not only will all of its deliveries by freight be cheaper, because diesel excise in the state of Tasmania is being cut to 20c per litre, but all of its capital equipment, which currently bears 22 per cent, will be effectively purchased without any tax at all under a GST system. - In addition, it can get the benefit of all input tax credits on everything that it buys, including matters that it cannot currently get in relation to power and the like. In addition to that, I presume the Launceston Examiner is owned by a company which will have its company tax rate reduced from 36 per cent to 34 per cent on 1 July and to 30 per cent on 1 July 2001. So I most certainly would not agree with the Launceston Examiner or anybody else who said that its business costs were not coming down, because business costs in this country to all companies, including the Launceston Examiner, are falling by billions of dollars, something that the Labor Party was never able to put into place.Other than that, if it is claimed that the price was being put up by 12 per cent solely as a result of tax changes - and I would certainly want to look very carefully at the claim - that would of course be misleading conduct and you would be entitled, Mr Speaker, if you were genuinely concerned about it, to alert the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. But perhaps you are unaware that you have the ability to do that, which again illustrates the fact that we should have more advertising to make clear to the members of the Australian Labor Party the remedies which are at their disposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The government is in the process of introducing Lifetime Health Cover, which is probably the major reform we have had to the private health insurance sector in over 30 years. It is part of a large number of reforms, which include the 30 per cent rebate, gap cover and prudential regulations. We have been criticised for undertaking these reforms but, collectively, they have made a very important contribution to the health care system. The criticism is encapsulated by the member for Jagajaga, who last year in this House said: The Australian public are well aware of what they get from Medicare and they do not have the government's ideological commitment to private health insurance. This week I received the results of some research we have been undertaking to underpin Lifetime Health Cover. A recent national survey found that 74 per cent of Australians actually agree with the government: they require a health system that has a balance between public and private health sectors. That is three out of every four Australians who do not share the member for Jagajaga's opinion on the health care system.In a press release earlier this year, she stated, `Instead of propping up private health insurance, the government should recognise that the public are very happy with Medicare.' Yes, Australians are happy with Medicare, but they also are very happy with the fact that they now have some choice in private health insurance, and they do not share the member for Jagajaga's ideological fixation with driving the private health care system into the ground.The research also gives us some very positive indications. Two-thirds of Australians unprompted are now aware of Lifetime Health Cover; and, prompted, 88 per cent of the Australian population is aware of Lifetime Health Cover. This shows the benefits of government information to the public. There is one level that is of some concern to us, and that is that only 62 per cent of people had an awareness of the cut-off date. This was after the first week of our being back in the marketplace advertising the changes, and this is an area we will be focusing on in the next couple of weeks. The cut-off date is 30 June. If people do not get in by then, they will miss out. The campaign `Run for cover' is very serious; people do not want to miss the opportunity of being treated as though they are 30 years of age for the rest of their life.</DOC>

 - There are a number of issues that the honourable member raises. The first point goes to our homeless strategy: $800 million over the next five years will go into SAAP; $60 million will go to the Reconnect Program; and - as I mentioned earlier on - $240 million will go into Stronger Families and Stronger Communities. As far as people who live in alternative forms of accommodation are concerned, whether they are in caravan parks or whether they are in bricks and mortar, the facts are that this government has increased pensions by four per cent - a two per cent real increase. We have increased rental assistance at the maximum thresholds by seven per cent. - The member for Grayndler spends a lot of time scaring these vulnerable people in our community. But the bottom line is that, for these particular individuals, rent assistance will be increased by seven per cent at the maximum rate. What this means is that for the majority of those people who live in mobile home parks - and they are great people who live right across Australia and particularly on the eastern seaboard and, indeed, in my federal seat of Richmond - three-quarters of the increase they face will be matched by rental assistance. The bottom line for these people is that, if they are a pensioner couple in a mobile home park, they will be between $11 and $12 a week better off and, if they are a single pensioner, they will be $6 a week better off. You would be better off spending your time looking after the homeless in Sydney than scaring a lot of innocent people. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The most important element of the government's information campaign is the GST Start-up Assistance Office, which has received some $200 million. The Labor Party has been falsely claiming that the government's advertising campaign is $360 million. In fact, it puts $200 million of assistance to community organisations to help them with their compliance as part of that campaign - $200 million goes to the GST Start-up Assistance Office, of which $150 million is directly delivered to organisations like the National Catholic Education Commission, which got $6 million.The Labor Party makes false claims about grants to community organisations and business organisations to help them with compliance costs. I have had numbers of meetings with business and community organisations, and not one of them has said to me yet that they think they have got sufficient amounts for this. But $200 million of it was for the GST Start-up Assistance Office going to those industry associations by direct grants to help them with compliance. The Labor Party would say, `Oh, well, it's a government advertising campaign.' Listen to some of the recipients: the National Catholic Education Commission, $6 million; ATSIC, $400,000 - presumably that is a GST advertising campaign. The ACTU was a beneficiary under the so-called advertising campaign. Anglicare Australia received a direct grant. The Salvation Army - the Labor Party wraps up grants to the Salvation Army and makes the false claim that it is advertising. St Vincent de Paul - $500,000 to help St Vincent de Paul with its tax obligation. There is the Council of Social Service of New South Wales with $3.6 million. Surf Lifesaving Australia also got megabucks. There is the Motor Traders Association. So that is $200 million which went to industry associations including churches, social welfare organisations, ACTU, in relation to helping them with compliance.There is another $36 million - which the Labor Party also wraps into its false claims - in information campaigns on the Australian business number and the PAYG system, both of which the Labor Party supports. They may not remember it, but it was actually their policy at the last election to introduce the ABN and the PAYG but without the GST. So you could hardly be against that informational campaign.The remaining $100 million of the so-called $360 million is not a yearly cost at all. It is a four-year program - and the Labor Party has added up the four years and claimed an expenditure - and $54 million is in the current year. The community campaign is $46 million. So you have $54 million in relation to business and its compliance and $46 million in relation to consumers.Let me make this point: introducing this tax change will secure $24 billion in revenue for the states this year. If the Labor Party wants to say that the $360 million could have been spent on new schools, what does it say about the $24 billion that will come from the GST? Does it say it is opposed to that $24 billion from GST revenue which will go to the states and which will fund every single school in Australia? The GST will fund every single school in Australia because the total state spending on education is $14½ billion. It will then fund all housing for all states in Australia, which is an additional $2 billion. It will then fund every last dollar of the $6.8 billion spent on law enforcement in this country. So, if the Labor Party wants to say that it is opposed to GST, then it is opposed to the funding of every school, every teacher, every house, every housing commission tenant, every policeman, every court, every prison and all of those services that the GST will fund. But of course we know that, when the Labor Party wants to run its populist campaign, it is against goods and services tax, until 30 June. At midnight on 30 June, the Labor Party becomes in favour of the goods and services tax. The Leader of the Opposition is so opposed to the goods and services tax that, if he is ever elected, he wants to keep it. He has come out and said, `I won't just keep it, I want to actually roll it back.' He cannot tell you where, he cannot tell you when and he cannot tell you how much. When he was on radio in Melbourne, he was asked by Jon Faine how he was going to pay the states all of this revenue to fund their schools, their hospitals and their law enforcement, how he was going to roll back the GST and how he was going to make up the revenue. Jon Faine said: You can increase excise on petrol and alcohol and cigarettes.And we know they are against that. He goes on:Is that what you propose? You can put up income tax rates again, or company tax again. But you can't have more money with less tax all across the board.This is the reply of the Leader of he Opposition:No, what I'll do is give you a sheet of paper on which you can write out all your ideas on these matters and you can send them up to us ...</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question, and can I say I particularly appreciate the constant and enthusiastic interest that he shows in foreign affairs matters. In the first interim military government decree, Fiji's military commander Commodore Bainimarama last night revoked the 1997 Constitution. This is unacceptable to Australia and is extremely disappointing. Commodore Bainimarama has confirmed the appointment of an acting prime minister and leader of the government, but he has not yet announced any other positions in an interim government.The Australian High Commissioner in Suva, Sue Boyd, met with Commodore Bainimarama last night, and the High Commissioner stressed the government's strongly held view that there must be a swift return to democratic rule, that it was unacceptable to overthrow the Constitution and, indeed, that it was unacceptable to grant the perpetrators of this terrorist act an amnesty. Commodore Bainimarama reiterated his hope that the interim political arrangements would be in place for as short a time as possible and that they would work towards a new or amended Constitution and prepare for fresh elections. We are concerned that Commodore Bainimarama said this morning that this might take somewhere between 12 months and three years. Commodore Bainimarama confirmed that President Ratu Mara is safe, but he has noted this morning that Ratu Mara does not wish to return as President.It is important to remember that this military takeover has been in response to an extreme situation. The Fiji authorities have been under immense pressure and have been forced to take drastic action under great duress. Our first priority - and I think all members of the House would agree with this - must be to resolve the hostage situation. As long as the hostages, including the now former Prime Minister and the now Acting Prime Minister's wife, are held by a terrorist, we recognise that the Fiji administrative authorities do not have much discretion in what action they can take. I have discussed this matter during the morning with New Zealand's foreign minister, Phil Goff, and both of us agree that the wise thing to do for the moment is to withhold final judgments until the hostage situation is resolved. We will then do what we can, and of course very much hope, to see a return to democracy and democratic values.Let me make this point: the inclusion of Speight and his immediate supporters in any future government would be completely intolerable. Our responsibility also inevitably lies with the Australians in Fiji. There are now 3½ thousand Australians there. The situation is being monitored on a 24-hour basis by my department. Australians in Suva continue to be strongly advised to leave Fiji or to relocate to a safer location. The situation is fluid, and I strongly recommend that all Australians in Fiji, or those considering travelling to Fiji, seek the latest information from my department.</DOC>

In the price exploitation guidelines, which is a yellow and black book, it states at 2.20 that the price rule is that no price should rise by more than 10 per cent as a result of the new tax system changes. The member for Wills also referred in earlier comments today to a price guide for consumers, which I understand is very popular with them. It has been very warmly welcomed by consumers. It is an indicative guide for consumers of individual prices that may occur within a range after 1 July. It surprises us on this side of the House that every time we take a step forward to protect the interests of consumers, it is the Labor Party that comes back to hold up the process. If the member for Wills and the member for Hotham are really serious about protecting consumers, pass the bill before the Senate now that gives additional powers to the ACCC in relation to price exploitation. There is a bill before the Senate; the Labor Party is holding it up because it is not serious about protecting consumers.</DOC>

 - As it happens, I am. My attention has been drawn to, and I have been heartened to read, the latest report from the OECD, which draws attention to one of the conspicuous features of Australia's economic performance over the last four years, and that has been the very big increase in labour productivity over that period of time. In fact, over the last four years, labour productivity in Australia has risen by 2.8 per cent - that is double the rate of increase in labour productivity during the 1980s when the Labor Party was in office. This has been achieved, I am very pleased to say, consistent with a steady rise in real incomes under the coalition's administration. One of the things that is enduringly to our credit and enduringly to the discredit of the Labor Party is that, when it was in government, the wages of ordinary workers fell. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, did not think it was rubbish when, as President of the ACTU, interviewed on The World Today on 22 March 1988, he had this to say:But even in regard to the wages policy itself, we've designed that wages policy so that the reduction in real wages was less for low income earners than for higher income earners.In other words, you were boasting about the fact that you had reduced real wages. Of course, you were right - you did reduce them. You reduced them in a very significant way because, over the 1980s, real wages fell at an annual average rate of 0.2 per cent, and, under the coalition, real wages have grown at an annual average rate of 2.3 per cent. We have been able to achieve that consistent with rises in productivity. We have also been able to deliver to those same working men and women of Australia, who were burdened with high interest rates by Labor, significantly lower interest rates.One of the reasons that we have been able to do this is that we have pursued a superior industrial relations policy. It is an industrial relations policy that has given to the workers of Australia a choice. They have had an opportunity of bargaining with the assistance of their union or collectively without union assistance, or individually. You get higher productivity when you encourage interaction between workers and their employers. You get lower productivity when you impose union domination where it is not wanted. That of course is one of the things that distinguishes us from the Australian Labor Party. At a time when only 20 per cent of the private sector work force in this country want to belong to a trade union, we have an opposition party that increasingly believes that the rip of the union movement should run throughout the Australian workplace, whether or not individual workers want it. It is a very important policy difference between the government and the opposition. We are for choice in the workplace; the Labor Party is for union domination in the workplace. I am quite certain that my colleague the minister for workplace relations could well return to this theme at some time in the future. Let me simply conclude my answer to the member for Petrie by saying that I know she is very experienced in small business and understands the importance of higher productivity. She understands the benefit of a workplace relations system based on the best possible relationship between the worker and the employer. She knows, as every member on this side of the House knows, that one of the great things that this government has done is to deliver a double benefit to the working men and women of Australia. We have delivered higher wages consistent with higher productivity, and we have also delivered significantly lower interest rates. That is a double that Labor could never achieve, and that is a double that the alternative approaches of the opposition will never be able to deliver in the future.</DOC>

 - The government has put in place a scheme of some $500 million to ensure that retailers, outside the metropolitan areas, get direct grants of either 1c a litre or 2c a litre or, in the event that there are extremely remote areas, possibly a contingency so that after the tax changes prices can be equalised back to consumers. I say `to consumers' because after the tax changes to business petrol prices will fall by 10 per cent. In relation to diesel users in the transport industry, the price will fall from 44c to 20c. This money will be paid directly to retailers. It is not being paid for the benefit of retailers but is to be passed on to consumers. The government will make that entirely clear. What is more, in evidence to the Senate estimates committee last night, Mr Asher detailed an extensive program of surveys, samplings, inspections and complaints mechanisms that the ACCC would be putting in place to ensure that the benefits are passed on to retailers. In addition to that - and of course the Labor Party opposes this - the ACCC is advertising price exploitation lines -  - You are opposed to that, apparently. Consumers will know where they can lodge their complaints. Any complaint that is lodged will be immediately investigated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I say to all of those consumers - and I know consumers of petrol are very informed consumers; they sure know when a price rises - that if they have any reason to believe that the grant is being pocketed by a retailer and not passed on they should notify the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. As I said on radio this morning, I've never heard a business yet complain that the ACCC has too little power. I've never heard anybody in business saying that they are worried that the ACCC's policing powers are not sufficient. I have heard a lot of criticism coming out of retailers and business that they think the ACCC may have too much power or may be too zealous, but I am yet to hear any business person in Australia or any retailer say, `Mr Costello, we think it is a toothless tiger.' The ACCC has extensive powers. Consumers are our best policemen. We will make sure that gets to consumers.  You hear these trick little questions from the Labor Party. What does it mean? They are against the grant scheme, are they? Is that what we take from this? Because you are attacking the grant scheme, would we be entitled to assume that you are against it? No, no, no. Because you are attacking the GST, would we be entitled to think that you will be repealing it? No, no, no. You are so opposed to the GST you want to keep it. You are so opposed to a grant scheme you want to keep it. This is just mere politicking from a group of people who would not have a policy to rub together in a blizzard. Every day they count down to 30 June saying, `How can we waste 10 questions today and distract the press from asking us what the real issue in Australia is: why has the Labor Party not got a policy to rub together?' </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. He asked whether alternative policies are being developed. There is no doubt they are being developed in ACTU headquarters in Melbourne. It seems that the ACTU has very successfully imposed this policy on the opposition. In fact, so concerned was the Leader of the Opposition to deny a couple of press reports this morning that he scurried out for a doorstop and only confirmed what was in the press this morning, which also revealed the fact that he does not even understand the policy which is being imposed on him by the ACTU.  - I do not understand your policy.  - This is sport, but it is serious. This is the policy you had in 1998. This is a better plan for industrial relations. We all know that in brackets it has `Written and authorised by the ACTU to be implemented by somebody without any ticker.' This is what your policy said. The doorstop -   - Mr Speaker, you would never release a policy like this, I can assure you. - The Labor Party's policy at the last election was to abolish Australian workplace agreements but to keep a system of individual agreements within the formalised statutory system. That was your policy which he attempted to deny this morning. The policy said:Labor will ensure that collective bargaining is given priority over all other forms of agreement making, including individual agreements reviewable by the commission.So the policy they had in 1998 was to allow individual agreements. I did not think much of the policy because you would neuter the effect of those agreements by other changes. But the policy Labor then had was to allow statutory individual agreements. If you can understand the doorstop this morning, the Leader of the Opposition has said, `We will not have Australian workplace agreements'; that is their policy. Fair enough; that is what you have said. You have also said that it will be your position to have, and to allow, individual contracts at common law. That is your policy. - Thank you; you have acknowledged that. Which is why your first sentence is untrue. Your first sentence says: I notice in one of the papers today that it is claimed that the Labor Party intends to outlaw in its industrial relations legislation individual contracts.  You will not allow individual contracts in industrial relations legislation. You are opposed to them because you have been told to oppose them by the trade union movement. Mr Speaker, in 1998 they were going to allow a statutory form of individual agreement but the unions do not like them. They have told the Labor Party that there will be no such agreements. That is why we see in the papers, confirmed in the doorstop today, that there will be no such thing as formalised individual agreements under the federal act. Brad Norrington is no supporter of ours, but he said this last week, on 25 May, in the Sydney Morning Herald: Beazley's problem, however, is that individual contracts of some sort have a legitimate place. They are a fact of life. Scrapping AWAs may please the unions, which despite their diminishing numbers still account for close to a majority of votes on the ALP conference floor and contribute much to party funding. He went on to say: But Beazley would send entirely the wrong message to business. In recent weeks Beazley has come under intense union pressure to scrap AWAs and replace them with nothing. He could still do this ... It would be stupid, however, not only because of the adverse reaction from business, but also because of the practical implications. Thousands of non-union workers on AWAs would be left high and dry, while the most zealous employers would simply switch to common law contracts, an option that was available to them and completely devoid of public scrutiny.  - Yes, you will allow common law agreements. You could not stop them, anyway. But common law agreements will be subject to union awards and union agreements. Common law agreements will be the second-class agreement stream, which is what the unions want. They want their agreements, their awards, to predominate over common law agreements. In 1998 the Labor Party had the same request from the unions and decided, in face of opposition from the unions, that they would retain a formal system under the act because they knew that it would be simply untenable for this country to turn its face against a sensible set of reforms and further market deregulation making for a more flexible system. As Brad Norrington has said, and as you yourself assessed back in 1998, this is a policy position which is untenable and only forced on you because the unions require it. And two other things: the Labor Party says, `There are not many people affected by it.' There are 100,000 people and it is growing by 3,000 a month -  - Don't worry about them. The fact that many of these agreements are family friendly is nothing to you. The other thing to watch is this. The spin doctors were out. They said, `Of course he will take a stand on non-union collective agreements.' What a joke! We had non-union collective agreements when Labor was in before. They were called EFAs. Over three or four years we had 250 something of them, covering about 10,000 or 15,000 workers. We have introduced a decent system. Nearly 200,000 workers are covered. There are nearly 2,000 agreements. They are a great system for those 80 per cent of workers who are not in a union. You are basically going to scrap those because you will go back to the policy you had when Labor was in office.  - I am talking about the operation of the non-union collective system.  - You don't understand it. You have been given a policy and you have just taken it holus bolus. This is a backward move by a Leader of the Opposition who does not have what it takes to stand up to a few union leaders and ensure that there is a policy that is to the genuine benefit of real workers. </DOC>

 - The answer is as was announced when the ACCC put out its price guidelines with the explanatory notes, which I am sure the honourable member has read, and as I informed the House yesterday - namely, that the Treasury modelling in the A New Tax System document is based on 107 ABS classifications. They are obviously groups. As was made clear at the time, there are 107 classifications. Two things have changed since that in relation to the ACCC price analyses. The first is that the ACCC has worked off individual products and not off classifications. In relation to individual products, once they are decoupled from those industry classifications they are the price changes which would be expected in relation to those individual products. Secondly, the package was substantially amended in the Australian Senate as a consequence of the exclusion of various items from the GST base, the consequent delay of the abolition of financial institutions duty, the consequent delay of the abolition of bank account debits tax, the consequent delay of the stamp duty on shares and marketable securities and the changes in relation to transport, in particular - the Labor Party was successful in jacking up the prices of transport by refusing to allow the government the opportunity to cut the price of diesel for all transport in Australia. As a consequence of those matters there were changes in relation to some individual items. They are essentially the changes between the two price classifications. The two have been fully explained in the notes, which no doubt the member has studiously read.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I am pleased to advise the House that today I have been in Scone at the local bowling club at a very well attended meeting of about 150 workers, their wives and families and people from the local community, to discuss with them the government's Employee Entitlements Support Scheme. I want to acknowledge the work done by the AMIEU - the workers union - in both organising the meeting and representing the views of the workers. I also want to thank Senator John Tierney, who came with me. He has been a tireless supporter of these workers, campaigning on their behalf to make sure that they get a fair deal. I was able to present a certificate to Mark Lawrence, who has also been very active on the committee for the campaign. That certificate marked the handing over of funds from the Commonwealth to Stephen Parbury, who is the receiver for the company that went broke back in January. That provided funds of just over $200,000 for 71 workers to ensure that they were given some assistance in the circumstances where the company was unable to meet its obligations to them. At the point of termination, the employee entitlements scheme provided, in this case, about 80 per cent of what the workers were entitled to. Sadly, they will not all get it because this is a scheme based on a fifty-fifty contribution. - Because people like the members opposite, who are New South Wales Labor Party members, are not prepared to stand up for workers. That is why. - Mr Speaker, 71 workers under the entitlements scheme with full payments from both sides will be eligible for small amounts of a few hundred dollars to over $10,000 in some cases. Obviously, it depends on their length of service. Mr Parbury, by coincidence, is also the national president of the relevant professional association. He made the practical point, having been associated with many of these situations, of what a good thing it was that finally there was some real help for workers in this situation. There were three things that came out of the meeting, which I would like to relay to the House. The first is that people were genuinely appreciative of the fact that there is a scheme to give them some genuine and practical help. Secondly, the mood of the meeting was that they definitely supported tightening up the Corporations Law to chase up employers who do the wrong thing. I did not tell them that the Labor Party is making it difficult to pass that legislation in the Senate, but they were pleased to hear that the -   -  - Do not look so blank. You people are responsible for your behaviour in the Senate, and that legislation ought to get through. Lastly, there is no doubt that the workers took the attitude that they would like to get a bit more. I reckon they are certainly entitled to a bit more and they are entitled to have the Labor Party in New South Wales put their hand in their pocket and match the Commonwealth dollar for dollar. I can tell you that people were genuinely bemused that a Labor government was not prepared to help workers who needed some assistance. I said to those workers that the coalition federal government will continue to campaign to make sure they get a fair deal. I made it very clear to them, as I make it clear today to state Labor premiers, that I will visit every state in this country and make the point that it is time that a few Labor premiers put their hands in their pockets and gave some assistance to workers in genuine need. Around the country there are over 500 employees who have lodged applications and, of course, most of those will be eligible. From this government there will be a helping hand; from the Labor Party, a closed door in their face. For those 500 employees from 69 companies, I can assure you that in each and every case we will do all we can to ensure that a fair deal is provided to them. Lastly, I said to the workers in Scone that I would make an appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to use the influence that he has to ring up Bob Carr, get him on the phone and say to him - just for once, if the Leader of the Opposition might stand up for workers - that it is time he matched us dollar for dollar.</DOC>

He said specifically to the residents at a number of meetings that he would much prefer to be in the Tweed than representing his own constituents in Grayndler. `I love it here; I wish I lived here,' he said. Well, why don't you spend some time looking after your own people? Yes, I bring many issues to the frontbench. The Prime Minister is very accessible, far more accessible than the Leader of the Opposition here or your previous leaders - and so is the Treasurer, Peter Costello. I will continue to bring issues, because this is a listening government, it is an open government.

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. As he knows, the Commonwealth has offered loans to the states to help them balance their budgets in the year 2000-01. This is a loan and, by agreement signed by all of the states, a loan which has to be repaid - a point I made on AM this morning. No sooner had I finished on AM this morning than somebody rang into the program. It was a bit of a spooky phone call.  -   - No, it was not Chris from Waramanga; Chris from Waramanga is sitting in the advisers box today. No, no, it was a spooky phone call from the member for Hotham, who rang in with his obligatory trade union bash about wages. Then he went on to this thing about loans. He said:The second thing that the Treasurer said today is that one State agrees with him ... in terms of the payment to them is a loan. Not one State agrees. He quoted Queensland.This is what he said. I am reading it out:And they have come back and said that they treat it as a loan because their auditor-general in every State treats it as a loan. That is what you said on AM this morning:He quoted Queensland. And they have come back and said that they treat it as a loan because their auditor-general in every State treats it as a loan. So in this spooky phone call he rings in to agree on the Queensland treatment. The second point I make is that it has to be repaid. I do not know if the Labor Party are campaigning to get the states out of repaying these loans but, if that is part of their campaign, they can actually put that in their costings. Not only are they going to roll back GST; apparently they are now in favour of giving a grant rather than a loan. This loan has to be repaid, as the states have covenanted. What is more, if the GST estimates bring in more than is in the forward estimates, the repayment of the loan has to be done notwithstanding giving the Commonwealth the opportunity to take some of the benefit of the upside risk. Whether they are given money or not they have to repay their loan. -  - They are given GST revenue - of course, they are given money; they are given all of the GST revenue - and they have to repay their loan. The third point is that the cash balance which is shown on the government finance statistics is interpreted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is responsible for the guidelines on the GFS under which we report the underlying cash balance, has not only written to this government and said it is a loan; it has written to each state government as well and told the states it should be treated as a loan. So here you have a written agreement, a covenant to repay, the deputy leader confirming it on radio this morning, the GFS and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If the Labor Party policy is that they would sell the Commonwealth out and not require a repayment of the loan, then we ought to hear it, but we have actually protected the Commonwealth's position. That loan must be repaid and, what is more, that gives the opportunity to the Commonwealth to benefit if revenue proceeds should be higher.</DOC>

 - I intend to say it again, Mr Speaker. The reason it is treated as a loan is that, firstly, there is a loan agreement under which it is made and has to be repaid, signed by every state. Secondly -  - I am asked why a loan to the states is treated as a loan in the government accounts. I give the answer as I already have done. First of all, it is treated as a loan which has to be repaid, signed up to by every state. In the intergovernmental agreement, the states asked for and received a loan which they are obliged to repay. Secondly, this has the ability to protect the Commonwealth, because it gives the Commonwealth the opportunity to participate in any additional revenues if they should be got from a higher revenue take from the GST. Thirdly, the government accounts its cash balance on GFS standards, as laid down by the Australian Bureau of Statistics - not by a state Auditor-General but by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has written not only to the Commonwealth and said this is the required treatment but to all of the states and said the same thing.In relation to Queensland, Queensland reported that in their midyear review, their last budget statement. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on radio this morning and said that Queensland treat it as a loan because their Auditor-General says it is a loan. But, regardless of that, the Commonwealth treats it as a loan for one simple reason: under GFS standards as required by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which require reporting according to those standards, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has not only said it is a loan but also has written to the states and said that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question and, on behalf of the government, I too add my congratulations to the Prime Minister for passing the period of time of the prime ministership of Mr Keating. May I say that Australia is much better for his prime ministership. Interest rates are lower, the budget is in surplus, unemployment has fallen, and many more Australians have been given an opportunity under the prime ministership of Mr John Howard.As the member for Farrer has reported, the OECD released its latest report on the world economic outlook. Members of perhaps both sides of the House will be pleased to know that it has revised up its projection for economic growth in Australia. I am sure the Labor Party would welcome the fact that Australia's growth prospects have been revised up. The OECD has revised up the expectation of growth in the year 2000 to 3.9 per cent and in 2001 to 3.7 per cent. I am sure both sides of parliament would welcome the fact that the OECD has projected the unemployment rate to continue to decline to 6.4 per cent in 2001. That would be the lowest unemployment rate in a decade and, if it should go through six per cent, we would have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. I think all members of the House would welcome the fact that unemployment in Australia has fallen. The OECD also states that increase in the CPI due to the introduction of the GST is not expected to become embedded into core inflation. Again I say to trade unions and employee organisations that there is no need to seek wage claims to compensate for GST, because you have received tax cuts.  - I am interested that the Labor Party interjects, because it was a point that the Labor Party made in 1985. I will get the quotes, if the House wants them, of when the Labor Party supported the GST. In 1985 it made it clear to unions that it did not expect wage claims to chase the CPI. In fact, the point was made by the then president of the ACTU. When the Labor Party supported the GST - let us put this on the record - they made it entirely clear that employees should not chase wage increases on the basis of those price changes. There was no stronger supporter of the consumption tax in the Labor Party cabinet than the now Leader of the Opposition - as appears in the memoirs: supported through the cabinet by the Leader of the Opposition and, as I recall, the then member for Holt. In those days, the Labor Party had leadership, and he was a good follower. Today, he is still a good follower. The trouble is that it has no leadership. If he had any ability to lead, he would stand down there and join with us and say that tax reform is something that this country has missed out on for the last 20 years and it has to be done now. They have the idea that they are going to try to skate through the next 30 days, fill in 10 questions a day and attack the goods and services tax and then, on 1 July, they are going to say, `That campaign that nourished us for two years is all over. We, the Labor Party, are so opposed to the GST that we are going to keep it.'This is a cheap, populist campaign against change by people who have no capacity to lead, only to follow. And, as has famously been said, the backbench may follow you, but only out of curiosity. The OECD also said that the budget will be in structural surplus in 2000 for the third time - 1998, 1999, 2000 - and will be again in 2001. So the OECD has independently confirmed a strengthening economy. Australia will be better off, will be stronger, for accomplishing tax reform. Notwithstanding the campaign of the Labor Party, they have failed. They have failed to defeat the introduction of a new tax system. Now all they hope to do is to benefit from it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and acknowledge his real involvement and interest in this particular industry. The trucking industry is of course very important to Australia, and it does have to be noted that owner drivers at the moment are facing some particular pressures. Operators are working for rates that are below break-even, and there is evidence of rates being driven down to levels that people simply cannot survive on and owner drivers going broke as a result. A series of roadblocks have been organised in recent times to draw public attention to the difficulties which long haul owner driver transport operators are experiencing.The government does recognise some of the particular difficulties that owner drivers have been facing - there is no doubt about that. The very rapid rise in crude oil prices in recent times has in particular put some in the industry under real pressure, and the cutthroat nature of that industry does mean that some small operators are having trouble extracting a fair deal in terms of freight rates. The government is working with the industry to explore ways forward in areas in which we can help. I have discussed these matters with the industry and with Professor Fels. I have talked with owner operators themselves, as well as with the TWU. But I would want to make the point that, whilst I think there are some areas where the government can help, there are many which are best dealt with in the industry. I cannot for example - and I must state this quite plainly - envisage a circumstance in which we would be legislating to fix minimum freight rates, which is a proposal being put by some in the TWU. I understand that the industry are meeting the Australian Industrial Relations Commission this Friday, and that they are updating what is called the Australian Road Transport Federation TWU costing model. That will give them a platform on which to talk through some of these issues.I have asked Senator Ron Boswell to work constructively through the issue. I understand that yesterday the TWU accepted that invitation, so it is with some regret that I learn today that, having yesterday accepted that invitation to work constructively, there are new blockades choking up key highways. I think that is regrettable. I do say that I think those owner operators, if they are serious, ought to get off those highways. I have just seen a statement put out by the Indigo Shire Council, which is in the electorate of the member for Indi, referring to the very real damage being done to roads and infrastructure as truckies look for alternative routes around the blockade, which is now quite extensive.Having made those points, I say this: I think one of the key issues that is rapidly emerging as the government seeks to work constructively with owner drivers is to establish just who can adequately represent them, because we have got the TWU out there at the moment staking a very ill-founded claim that they represent the views of long-distance drivers. I do not believe the TWU has ever been a friend of long-distance owner drivers, and owner operators should not be conned by the TWU's claims.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question, and I know his dedication to helping young people in his electorate. In the recent evaluation of the Job Network the government's new apprenticeships centres have received another vote of confidence from employers. Employer satisfaction with new apprenticeships centres was recorded as being at 82 per cent. Employers like the information the centres provide. They like the integrated service, and they like the assistance with incentives. They particularly like in the New Apprenticeships system the opportunity to choose those who will provide the off the job training, whether in a public or private training provider. As a consequence, we now have in Australia record numbers of new apprentices and strong support from employers who value the choice and responsiveness of the new system.Yet what do we get from the Labor Party and the Australian Education Union? That they want to get rid of the very features that have made new apprenticeships attractive. They want to push off the job training back onto public providers. They want to get rid of private providers competing with the public providers, and they want to get rid of the right of employers to choose who is going to provide the training to the apprentice. This is the policy that the Australian Education Union has just announced. And we all know that the Australian Labor Party is the puppet of the unions. They sit there on Sharan Burrow's lap - Shazza's lap - while she manipulates the eyebrows, puts the words through the mouth, controls every movement, because they are nothing more than puppets of the union movement. If Sharan Burrow were taking a glass of water the Leader of the Opposition would not be able to say anything at all about education. Do you know what I would like to see, Mr Speaker? I would like to see the Leader of the Opposition stand up to the Australian Education Union. Their confidence must be sky high at the moment. The union's confidence must be sky high, because the Leader of the Opposition has just rolled over on individual contracts. - The Australian Education Union has just put out a policy which means that employers will in future, under Labor, be denied the opportunity to choose who will train their new apprentices. That is the AEU's policy, and it will soon be the Labor Party's policy because we know that, as soon as the Australian Education Union enunciates a policy, the Leader of the Opposition - trudging through the policy desert, looking for a drink of water, gratefully accepting anything the Australian Education Union offers him - will pick it up and put it into practice. We will wait for the July conference of the Australian Labor Party and we will see them pick up that policy. - Let us be quite clear about the consequence of this policy of the Australian Education Union being picked up by the Australian Labor Party. It would lead to many of the 4,000 private training providers going out of business, it would destroy training opportunities for up to 350,000 young Australians and it would rip the heart out of the New Apprenticeships system. We know the record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was education and training minister: 20,000 apprenticeships disappeared in one year. Now the Australian Education Union wants the Labor Party to take out the whole New Apprenticeships system. The Leader of the Opposition, by his record, has shown that he is prepared to roll over, time and time again, to union pressure. Australian young people cannot afford to have 350,000 training opportunities lost, and I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to tell the Australian Education Union that, on this one occasion, he will stand up to them, refute what they say and continue to support the government's very successful New Apprenticeships system. </DOC>

 - The full quote, which is always handy to have when the Labor Party is asking questions, is: Well, I must say, I think I was told yesterday. - And when I checked my records later in the day, I corrected it later in the day. The Labor Party is very fond of using false quotes. The Leader of the Opposition said I had said in the same interview that the auditor had cleared me. I have actually looked at it now. I will read you the whole quote:Yes, they've been nagging about it for a long time, but really they haven't landed a punch. - Well, Sport, I will read the day before:Do you believe you're now in the clear?MICHAEL WOOLDRIDGE: I certainly am. The auditor found no impropriety on my behalf. So you are dead wrong in your question, as you usually are.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. His electorate of Wannon is celebrating today's latest round of Networking the Nation projects, for the electorate of Wannon has benefited enormously from the strong and brash representation of the member for Wannon. He does not pull punches, the member for Wannon. As a result, the electorate of Wannon will share in $2.3 million of funding for three projects under Networking the Nation, including six new multimedia centres throughout the region and $1.5 million to localise STD phone calls within the region. The Prime Minister announced these projects this morning. There was $65 million in this round. That means that $200 million has been spent on Networking the Nation on 400 projects to date. Another $220 million is to come. This all opens up some $1 billion for information technology and telecommunications projects from the privatisation of Telstra to date, and that is not including another $1 billion for environmental refurbishment works. It is very significant.Do Labor support these benefits to regional communities? No, of course not. Labor oppose Networking the Nation. It was their policy at the last election to oppose Networking the Nation. They are totally opposed to up to $1 billion for information technology and telecommunications. What do they have in its place? What is Labor's policy to repair the dilapidated and depleted telecommunications infrastructure throughout rural and regional Australia? None. You allowed it to happen through your 13 years in government. We are repairing it, we are refurbishing it, and all we get is opposition from you. That is unfortunate. I notice that the electorate of Bendigo has received almost $200,000 for a youth web site that is going to assist young people with an online service framework across five municipalities in central Victoria, including the establishment of 10 public access kiosks. Do you oppose it? Are you announcing it? Are you supporting it? - I am reminded, Mr Speaker, that the member for Bendigo a couple of weeks ago claimed on local radio that the government was reneging on a $2 million arts grant to the arts precinct of Bendigo at the same time as we were finalising the deed of agreement with the local council. Some might call that a barefaced lie. I call it a falsehood -  -  - What was the word - an inaccuracy, misinformed? You actually went on radio and said that government was not providing $2 million when the ink was not yet dry. Amazing! I do not know what you are going to say about this $200,000 benefit to your electorate. It does not matter whether it is country Labor, modern Labor, real Labor or new Labor - all terms that the Leader of the Opposition has adopted -  - There are electorates all across Australia that are celebrating the commitment of the government to Networking the Nation. I am fascinated that `Country Labor' was suggested by the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, but adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. `Real Labor', suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. I think `Modern Labor' is his own term. `New Labor' is used by Tony Blair or the member for Werriwa.  - Mr Speaker, it does not matter what you call this Labor. This is a Labor Party that neglects rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I do not think the dates are quite right in that the date a minute goes out of the department is not necessarily the date it arrives in my office, and the date it is signed by me is not the date it goes out. Allowing for that, they are broadly right. - As the secretary did say to me that something had to be addressed, there was concern at the time that there might be other inaccuracies. My office wanted to check whether that was the case. The view was that this was an absolutely trivial matter that had no substance at all. In fact, the Auditor, in a letter of 12 May, said that he was aware of this and it did not change his analysis, his findings or his conclusions. Nonetheless, I did believe the House should be given the courtesy of having it corrected. - I asked for the department to do this in writing, as I recollect, on 10 December. The department did not do this. The inaccuracy in Ms Rogers's statement is, as I said, trivial. It does not change the substance of matters, and that was the Auditor-General's view. You have to ask: why are the opposition going on and on about this? I think they are embarrassed. They were embarrassed that, when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Finance, there were only 18 MRI machines in Australia on which you could claim. Today there are 66. When the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Finance, there was a five-month wait for these machines. Today there is a one-week wait. The Leader of the Opposition allowed an $800 cost to patients for these machines - it now costs around $50 - and, as against none being in rural Australia, we have 17 in rural Australia. It has been very good for the Australian public. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and her support for the 11 Job Network sites in her electorate. When the government set up the Job Network, it invited some of the finest organisations in Australia to join in what has turned out to be a grand venture. The government would provide the money and organisations like the Salvation Army, Mission Australia and Centacare, as well as the private sector, would provide the professionalism and the expertise to give the job seekers of Australia a new deal. This is the new politics in action. This is the social coalition at work. These are social businesses enhancing the social capital of the nation - with government as partner, not as director; with government helping to rebuild the bonds between individuals and communities which the old style `Canberra knows best' bureaucracies had done so much to weaken.As the House knows, these community organisations have risen magnificently to the challenge, and the Job Network is outperforming the old system by about 50 per cent in getting job seekers into work. These organisations have done this only because they have invested massively, millions of dollars, into their operations and they have committed themselves in some cases for years in advance. Unfortunately, it is far from clear that the opposition has grown out of its traditional fixation with central planning and control. In a speech two weeks ago to the Jobs Australia Conference, the shadow minister for employment said that the Job Network would remain for the foreseeable future, but only given that there are contracts in place. At the very least, if the Job Network is to be completely refocused on training, that would require a major rewrite of those contracts.She went on to say that the jury is still out on the role of the church and the charitable sector in for-profit service delivery. What did she mean by this? Did she mean that the Job Network should not be run on a performance basis, or did she mean that organisations like the Salvos, Mission Australia and Centacare should not be allowed to participate? Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the opposition has questioned the legitimacy of church based agencies delivering these sorts of services. At the end of last year in this very House, none other than the Leader of the Opposition himself dismissed church agencies as `good-hearted amateurs'. He said they were nothing but `good-hearted amateurs'. In April 1998, he said:But I've got enough knowledge of this to know that failure in this system that's been established by this Government is virtually inevitable.If he was looking into his crystal ball, he is completely wrong. He has been proven wrong by events. But, if he was predicting what would happen under a Labor government, he has to clarify exactly where the opposition stands. This week in the Senate estimates hearings, Senator Kim Carr, the factional warlord of the Labor Left, has raised the prospect of an incoming government simply cancelling Job Network contracts. This is a direct threat to thousands of Job Network sites, to thousands of jobs and to the millions of dollars invested in these operations by church and community organisations as well as by the private sector. It is a direct threat to the 700,000 job seekers of this country who are relying on these organisations for help. Unfortunately, it is typical of a feral opposition which regards any cooperation with government programs as some kind of fraternisation with the enemy. The Leader of the Opposition needs to say exactly what his attitude is to the Job Network. Does he stand by his comments of 1998, or does the follower-in-chief follow now the member for Dickson? Does he follow Senator Carr? Or is he, as always, simply following the union movement and more interested in supporting the union block vote than he is in giving the Job Network members of this country the security, the confidence and the tenure they deserve? </DOC>

 - AWAs have been a fantastic success - a great success. There have been over 100,000 of them. They have provided workers with choices that you, the Labor Party, would deny workers. The Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed by the fact that you would need the MCG just to find enough places to fit in all of the workers who have had AWAs.There was a turning point in this debate about AWAs in the last 12 months. The turning point was when BHP offered individual contracts in their iron ore operations in Western Australia. It has been recognised that BHP have for a long time taken the attitude that they are keen to work with the unions, and I believe that is still their attitude today. But they also took the attitude that at a cost disadvantage of $2.50 a tonne compared to Rio Tinto it was about time they improved their workplace relations. So they offered their employees - many of them earning more than $100,000 a year - individual contracts so as to ensure that their operation was more competitive. The union movement effectively lost the appeal that they took to the full Federal Court. The only way the unions now know to stop individual contracts is to push over the weak Leader of the Opposition and to get that policy through the parliament.The other point I want to make is that 100,000 is a lot of AWAs but it is not just the quantity of AWAs that is important. There are many businesses where the mere fact that they have had an AWA able to be offered has changed behaviour and provided for better workplace relations as a result. Lastly, when you are entering into an AWA there is no doubt there are processes involved in it. There is red tape involved with an AWA, and that is because when the AWA process went through Senate the Democrats insisted that we have a system there which would properly protect the rights of workers and ensure that workers were properly informed. It is true that we would like to make some further changes, and the Labor Party stopped those changes in the Senate. It is true, but it does not deny the simple fact AWAs have been a great success. The Leader of the Opposition has been told by the unions they are to be abolished, and he always does what the unions tell him.</DOC>

 - I say to the honourable member for Moreton that I am aware of that statement. In fact, that statement was made last night by the Leader of the Opposition. May I say that I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. I agree very emphatically with the Leader of the Opposition that the smooth operation of industrial relations is a vital part of national welfare. It is because industrial relations has operated smoothly under this government that we now have 700,000 more people in work, we now have higher real wages than under Labor and we have higher productivity, and it is one of the things that have contributed to lower interest rates. In other words, one of the conspicuous successes of this government, against all of the gloomy predictions from the other side, has been the strength and the smoothness of the industrial relations changes that have been implemented by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.One would have thought that if you were trying to build a case for change to Australia's industrial relations system - as the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do - you would first explain to the Australian public what the problem was. You would first identify how the system we have implemented has failed. Presumably, you would be able to point to more strikes, you would be able to point to higher unemployment, you would be able to point to lower real wages, you would be able to point to higher inflation, you would be able to point to higher interest rates. But the reverse is the case. It is exactly the opposite of what was predicted in the run-up to the 1996 election. For one of the more remarkably belligerent, out-of-touch, arrogant and contemptible statements ever made by an industrial leader in this country, we remember Bill Kelty's remarks on AM on 22 February 1996. He said:All I can say is this: the recent skirmish in terms of Weipa. It's just simply the sonata, just simply one piece. If they want a fight, if they want a war, then we'll have the full symphony, the full symphony, with all the pieces and all the clashes and all the music. If anybody thinks that they were the unwanted, unsolicited outpourings of a trade union leader, when asked about it the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on 23 February, the following day:I think they are statements of reality.In other words, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as spokesman for the then government, and Mr Kelty were predicting industrial chaos and industrial mayhem, dare I say, hoping that those recklessly indifferent, insensitive remarks would, in fact, be borne out. Of course, a few months later they were really complicit in organising one of the most disgraceful demonstrations this parliament has ever seen. We have never had a satisfactory disavowal of what happened in the lead-up to the 1996 budget outside this building from the Leader of the Opposition and certainly not from the leadership of the trade union movement.In 1998 just 72 working days were lost per 1,000 employees. That was the best outcome for 86 years. There were 87 working days lost in 1999 and, in the 12 months to February 2000, the number of days lost per 1,000 employees stood at 91. I might add that the most recent increase is in no small measure due to the irresponsibility of the manufacturing, construction and transport unions in Victoria and the fact that the state Labor government is encouraging, by its own slipshod policies, the development of a greater atmosphere of union militancy in the state of Victoria.On any measure, can I say to the member for Moreton that the principle laid down by the Leader of the Opposition has been magnificently fulfilled, indeed surpassed, over the last four-and-a-bit years by the industrial relations policies of this government. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if you want to build a case for your cowardly capitulation to the union movement over industrial relations and if you want to justify the weak, spineless approach you have taken towards industrial relations, then go out to the workers who are better off under this government than they were under the former Labor government and explain why you should change a system and replace it with a system that would cut their real wages rather than increase them - a system that would encourage higher inflation and therefore higher interest rates. The undeniable reality is that workers are better off under this government than they were under the Labor government. The thing that sticks in the throat of many members of the Labor Party now is that, despite the fact that they boast that they were the friends of the workers, when they were in government they boasted about cutting the wages of workers, they did cut the wages of workers, they lifted their interest rates and they destroyed their jobs. Now, under a coalition government, I can look the working men and women of Australia in the eye and say, `Under this government you are better off, your interest rates are lower, your wages are higher and your children have more jobs.' All of this is a result of a range of policies, including the industrial relations policy of my colleague.So I welcome the fact that at last long we have a policy, through the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition - written by the trade union movement but through the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition; but at long last we have it. I welcome the opportunity to debate who has done the better job for the working men and women of Australia - the coalition government or the members of the Labor Party? The Labor Party ought to remember that it does not exist to placate the union bosses; it ought to exist to look after the workers. That is what this opposition has conspicuously failed to do. When the minister for workplace relations went to Scone yesterday, where was state Labor? Where was the New South Wales Labor government matching us dollar for dollar? What a bail-out! They do not like this; they do not like the fact that, when it comes to hard cash, to real wages, to lower interest rates and to more jobs, you are a long way behind the performance of the coalition government, and that is hardly a case for changing an industrial relations reform that has been superbly in the national interest and overwhelmingly in the interests of the working men and women of Australia. </DOC>

 - I do not have any information about the facts which the shadow minister puts to me, but I can say to the House that there are provisions in the Workplace Relations Act against coercion, and those provisions also provide remedies. I am not in a position to comment more on the facts put to me by the shadow minister, but I have another example where certain claims have been made about Australian workplace agreements which, when checked, we find inaccurate. For example, this morning the Leader of the Opposition said that Blackbird Cafe, which I had never heard of until he mentioned it, had dropped AWAs. The reason he would say this is that the unions have told him, and he is a man who does everything the unions tell him without bothering to check the facts. I can inform the House that we have rung Blackbird and I have a fax from them saying, `We confirm that we have no intention of dropping our Australian workplace agreement.' He ought to check the facts. He ought to have a word with those union leaders and tell them that it is a bit embarrassing just to keep repeating what they say without checking first.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Both the number of AWAs and the mere existence of AWAs provide people with a very significant element of choice in the way in which they settle their arrangements at work. Under the Workplace Relations Act, you can have a collective agreement or you can have an individual agreement. The value of that is that businesses are not all the same. Many businesses, even in the same market, might have different circumstances. They may have different numbers of employees, and they may have different requirements from their customers. The great value of the Australian workplace agreement is that it gives you a choice about the way in which you come to a deal at work. This is hardly a novel idea. In fact, it is an idea that has had bipartisan support. It shows you the extent to which the federal Labor Party is running the union line when last night the Leader of the Opposition announced a policy which contradicts statements made very recently by his own shadow minister. On 11 May the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, said: Further, Labor has consistently supported the notion that parties should be free to seek to negotiate agreements that are best suited to their needs.I agree with that, but the trouble is that the policy dictated by the ACTU does not. The policy of the ACTU is that you can have an individual agreement only if it is a common-law agreement. In other words, you are allowed to have a common-law agreement only because union agreements and union awards overcome the operation of a common-law agreement. You are not to have any flexibility under the Labor system unless the unions have the right to knock off any agreements that people enter into.Opposition member - Is it your intention to maintain awards? - We think that an award system providing a set a minimum conditions for workers is a good idea, but what we want to do after that is also give workers the choice to settle arrangements that best suit themselves. The fact is that it has been a great success. The Leader of the Opposition has already been caught out misleading us about the circumstances of one business. He has also been caught out this morning. He said that the cost of an AWA is $500. That has been the subject of estimates hearings in the Senate and in fact there is specific advice from the advocate that the cost is not $500. I am told that the official figure on the record is actually $56.07. AWAs are a great success. They provide choice which the Labor Party claim to want to support, and it is only union leadership which prevents them. Lastly, look at what employers have been saying. It is not just ACCI which support them but also the Australian Industry Group. They say:The current Workplace Relations Act which provides a choice between AWA's and certified agreements is balanced and fair.That was the same conclusion that the Democrats came to. It is a pity that the Labor Party cannot support the right of workers to have the deal that suits them best.</DOC>

 - What incredible hypocrisy! Do you have no shame? The Labor Party are asking us about the extent of wage increases. When they were in government, they boasted that they reduced people's wages. Here is what the member for Hotham said back in 1988:But even in regard to the wages policy itself, we've designed that wages policy so that the reduction in real wages was less for low income earners than for higher income earners.We are proud, if I may say so, of the fact that under this system run by this government people have had increases in their real wages. That is not my boast; that is a boast made by none other than those who write your policy for you, the ACTU. - Mr Speaker, I invite you to listen to the words of the ACTU. - This was in `Unions at work', issued by the incoming secretary. He said:Since 1996, the Living Wage has achieved an increase, after inflation, of 9.1% for the lowest paid workers - a record admired by our counterparts overseas. This is a system that works. It works to the advantage of -  - The point about AWAs is that more and more people are entering into them. -  - They are. They are entering into them because they are a good system. It is not just wages that attract people to Australian Workplace Agreements. Off the top of my head, I think 75 or 80 per cent of AWAs have family friendly provisions. These are facts on the public record, and they are uncomfortable facts for the Leader of the Opposition because, when you abolish AWAs, you abolish a choice that people have to better balance what they do at work and the responsibilities they have in their family.The number of new AWAs approved in the first four weeks of May has been a record 5,421 and in May so far, in terms of filing, there have been 6,233. There have been 100,000, and we say roughly 3,000 extra a month, but on those figures it is more like 4,000 or 5,000 a month. That means that, on AWAs alone, at the next election you are going to prevent 150,000, 160,000, 170,000 workers from having the choice that they have otherwise exercised. It is no wonder that workers all around the country, including workers at Scone, reckon that this government is the friend of workers - they are absolutely right, and you are going to hear that message a lot more.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. Flexible labour markets make a great contribution to economic growth, and that is because, by allowing employers and employees to fix wages and conditions, they can respond to events, they can share in productivity growth and employees can get higher wages. This is a point that has been made by the International Monetary Fund, who reported in their public information notice for the year 2000 on Australia as follows:Reflecting strong growth and greater labor market flexibility, the unemployment rate has been trending down since the early 1990s, and reached about 7 percent in December 1999.The IMF said:... in order to build on this performance, sustained implementation of the structural reform agenda was essential, including through ... further deregulation of the labor market ...The International Monetary Fund has recognised the steps that Australia has taken and has encouraged Australia to continue them. The OECD has done the same. The OECD, in its economic survey for the year 2000, said in relation to Australia:Economic efficiency should be strengthened further and the rate of structural unemployment reduced through the ongoing move to a flexible industrial relations system ...So our flexible industrial relations system has been recognised by the IMF and by the OECD. It has been recognised as making a contribution to reducing unemployment. Productivity growth in Australia has gone up - it has averaged 2.6 per cent under the coalition, compared to 1.5 per cent under Labor - and wages have been higher under the coalition government as a consequence. Real wages growth has averaged 2.3 per cent under the coalition, compared with 0.3 per cent per annum under Labor.  - The member for McMillan interjects, the youthful Trotsky on the other side, and talks about cuts in real wages. He was not here at the time, but the Labor Party used to boast throughout the 1980s that one of its great achievements had been cutting real wages. That was the boast of the Keating government. They used to stand at this dispatch box, and we used to listen to it day in and day out, and claim that one of the great achievements of Labor had been cutting real wages. They saw that as an absolute achievement. The coalition sees the increase in real wages as the achievement - 2.3 per cent per annum rather than 0.3 per cent under Labor. The evidence is there in relation to unemployment. When this government was elected, unemployment was 8½ per cent. Today, it is 6.8 per cent, coming down from Labor's 11.2 per cent. Unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent under the Labor Party, and who was the employment minister at the time?Last night we had a back to the future speech delivered by the opposition leader for and on behalf of the ACTU. It was essentially back to the future because all of the advances that have been made, as recognised by the OECD and the IMF, had to be reversed so that we could go back to the situation where the ACTU controlled wage fixing, kept productivity low, kept real wages low and kept unemployment high. It was a spooky speech that was delivered last night. It was a back to the future speech, and it was not thought out and it had no idea about knowledge nation or education. It was: where would the ACTU like to take us next?Labor has flirted with names for itself from time to time. It was New Labor for a while; it was going to model itself on Tony Blair and get rid of the socialisation clause. Then it decided that was too hard. Then it became Country Labor. It was going to go out into the regions spearheaded by Ferguson and Crean - the ACTU presidents, Batman and Hotham, the Count of Hotham and the Prince of Batman. The Labor Party is full of the old ACTU and second-generation politicians. What do you have to do to get on in the Labor Party? You have to be an ACTU president or get born in the back of a Comcar. That is the way you get on in the Labor Party - get born in the back of a Comcar. - My point is that the ACTU policy is not a blueprint for Australia's future. It is a return to the past. It has no place in a modern economy. It is not recognised by the IMF. It is not recognised by the OECD. It is a backward step. The sooner the Labor Party can break the link with the trade union movement, the sooner it can become a real contributor to policy debate in this country.</DOC>

 - My view is that those million-plus workers should not be able to be pushed around by some union leader. It is as simple as that. There are a lot of common-law contracts. Of course there are; there always will be. You cannot abolish them. As much as the unions do not like individual agreements, you cannot abolish them. We have had common-law contracts for many years and we always will have them. The point about an agreement under the Workplace Relations Act is that, subject to the no disadvantage test, it displaces the operation of the award. If you have a common-law agreement, then you have to comply with each and every one of the prescriptions under the award system. There is no flexibility: you have to comply with each and every aspect of the award.  The agreements were introduced by you; it was Labor Party policy. You used to think it was a good idea that an agreement could be brought in to overcome the operation of the award, subject to the no disadvantage test, to give people flexibility at work. The system that you propose for the private sector - where only two out of 10 people are in a union - is that the unions, controlling 20 per cent, will have the right to control the other 80 per cent. That is not fair, it is not in the interests of workers, and it is a complete capitulation to the union control policy which they have foisted upon you. It is not in the interests of workers, whether in Scone or anywhere else, and the Labor Party ought to know that. In 1998 it was Labor Party policy to at least allow individual agreements under the Workplace Relations Act. Okay, you did not want to call them AWAs because that was our idea, but you were going to allow them. The fact of the matter is that you are not going to allow any individual agreements under the Workplace Relations Act. That means that all those common-law agreements will be subservient to the blokes who run you - namely, the ACTU. If that was the first shot in the election campaign, I welcome it. It was a policy written and authorised by the ACTU and spoken by Kim Beazley, who does not know the facts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On Tuesday, the federal member for Bass raised a matter in relation to GST pricing and the Launceston Examiner. -  - She's leaving. Don't go! - Mr Speaker, she asked:... how do you explain the fact that the over-the-counter price of the Examiner, Monday to Friday, will increase by 12½ per cent and the Saturday edition by 13.6 per cent? Some correspondence between the Examiner newspaper and the honourable Michelle O'Byrne, federal member for Bass, has come into my possession, and I think it is totally appropriate that I bring it to the attention of the House. - I have a public duty to do so. The letter begins:Dear Michelle - that is where the niceties end - I am appalled and disappointed at your misrepresentation of my letter to subscribers in Federal Parliament yesterday. I was brought up by my father to believe the Labor Party stood for honesty and fairness. It appears those values went with people like Lance Barnard and Gil Duthie.As a subscriber, you would have received a copy of my letter. It clearly points out that the increase relating to the GST is 9.5%.He goes on to explain the detail of that and says:We set out to be open and honest in the best interests of our readers.He goes on to say:If my letter -  - I am happy to table it. - Shall I start again, Mr Speaker? - The letter, which is from the Chief Executive of Launceston's local paper, the Examiner, goes on to say:If my letter confused you - that is the member for Bass - the facts could have been ascertained by a call from any of your staff to me. It would have been much more constructive. The newspaper employs 180 people, mostly in your electorate. They believe in their service to this community. They share my disappointment this morning. -  - Sure! I am happy to table the letter. Mr Speaker, as is appropriate in these matters, I will refer this letter to the ACCC. I am happy to table the letter since the opposition is asking for it to be tabled. And I am happy to ensure that consumers and small business are protected. The Labor Party continues to misrepresent on this issue.</DOC>

 - I am quite happy to take that question. It is based on a false premise. The proposal provides that farmers who have to go off farm to earn income can so earn that income and offset their losses against that income if that income is $40,000 or less. I think you will find that most people who go off farms to earn incomes are in that bracket; they are not high income earners. They are the kinds of people who might go into a town to work with livestock or as a nurse or as a teacher or something like that. That provision has been put in very specifically to ensure that somebody in that situation who goes off farm to earn an income is able to deduct their farm losses against their wage and salary income, while protecting against high income earners, who would obviously be earning above $40,000, from setting up hobby farms and deducting what is essentially a hobby against wage and salary income. The provision was put into the legislation to protect that situation, even though it was not in the original proposal.The second part of your question asked what work had been done in relation to this proposal. The point to remember is this: there have always been guidelines against using essentially a hobby, which a farm can be, as a tax deduction. The Ralph business review, which was set up under John Ralph and also included Rick Allert and Bob Joss, said that there was too much confusion over those guidelines. It said that there ought to be a specific five-tier test. The test related to the value of the farm, the income it generated, whether or not a loss was expected in two out of five years, and other independent objective facts. The reason it did that was so that people would be in the clear on an independent, objective, factual basis and able to determine their tax situation. This government added an additional test, which was the $40,000 test, because we were mindful of the situation of the hobby farmers. Those people have been protected, in addition to what was recommended by the independent panel. That is the point: in addition to what was recommended by the independent panel. The government is proceeding with the recommendations, with that amendment. It will cover hobby farmers. It is a welcome addition to the tax law. It will ensure that ordinary, decent taxpayers do not have to, through the tax system, subsidise those people who are really using hobbies as tax deductible opportunities, and it will make the Australian taxation system fairer. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. He is obviously very interested in this issue. The government's objectives are always absolutely focused on opening up new markets across the world for Australia's manufactured goods and produce and will continue to be so. That will be the absolute objective when Australia chairs the APEC ministerial in Darwin next week. This is the first significant meeting of trade ministers since the WTO Seattle meeting last year. It is the first significant meeting of trade ministers since China's accession to the WTO became assured with the passage of the PNTR legislation vote in the US recently. We want to make sure that we maintain the momentum towards the launch of a new round. APEC is a very important and powerful regional forum. It represents 60 per cent of the world's GDP and the markets within APEC take 70 per cent of Australia's exports. They are markets that we are continuing to work towards opening up to create a much fairer and freer trading regime. We will be pushing to maintain the focus of APEC's support for the launch of a new round on the core trade issues. We will not be allowing issues such as labour standards to be dragged onto the centre of the page like they were in Seattle. That ultimately caused the breakdown of talks in Seattle. We have seen the results of that. That has not been good for Australia's exporters. At the end of the day, the best job that we can do for Australian exporters is to open up new markets across the world. The best way of achieving that is to get a new comprehensive round of multilateral trade negotiations launched. I was asked about alternative views. There are a number of alternative views. Some of them almost accord with the government's view. We welcome those. In a speech to the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Labor's spokesman on trade, Senator Cook, said:... I am a strong supporter of free trade. Not 'fair trade'. Free trade. Naturally, free trade in itself will not solve the world's problems. We accept that support for our agenda. I must admit that Senator Cook was with the delegation in Seattle and supported the Australian efforts in Seattle, unlike some of his ALP colleagues from the union movement who were in Seattle at the same time. We did not see too much of them. I suspect they were on the streets with their union mates protesting about free trade and fairer trade across the world. It is interesting to note some of the other comments that have been made on this issue recently. I will quote none other than the boss of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow. She was referring to Peter Cook's comments about free and fair trade when she said:My understanding from discussions with Peter Cook is that that is his own position. She went on to say:I'm not sure the Labor Party has a position overall yet.That is not surprising. She went on to say further in that same interview:I would hope that the ALP - and I'm fairly confident that they will - will support the position of the ICFTU and other international unions. That is the position of the ACTU. You ask yourself: what is going to be the position of the ALP at this year's conference in Hobart in a month or so? Australian exporters are also asking themselves the question: what is the position of the ALP? They know the government's clear position. It is about policies that are supported by our regional partners. We will be pushing them forward at the Darwin meeting in the pursuit of opening up new markets. While Sharan Burrow was making those comments, Doug Cameron - the person I referred to earlier as, I think, being in Seattle and being on the streets - the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, was quoted in an article by Laurie Oakes:  Cameron, a very powerful figure in the union movement, attacked the ALP for 'an uncritical acceptance of the current unfair, damaging and job-destroying `free trade' and `free market' agenda'. He said he could see no difference between trade minister Mark Vaile and Labor shadow minister, Peter Cook, and he called on Beazley to 'wake up ...As members of the ALP head down to their conference in Hobart we have the prospect of Peter Cook going head to head with Shazza and Dougie on trade policy. It will be interesting to see who comes out on top. In the meantime, Australia's exporters are asking: `Will it be Peter's policy? Will it be Shazza's policy? Will it be Dougie's policy? What will Kim's policy be?' The best response to the question `What will Kim's policy be?' is probably contained in the Laurie Oakes article, where it states: When Shazza rings, the opposition leader jumps ...</DOC>

 - I have also heard reports that there have been delays in getting mail to the troops in East Timor. I have had them investigated. I have also had calls from family members who, when they read that article, said that they have had reports back from East Timor that mail is getting there in record time - in as little as three to four days. We do take this issue seriously. It is a free mail system. If there is a problem somewhere and if you have identified where the problem is, I think it is your duty to come and tell us where it is so it can be fixed.  -  - I have asked the defence department to investigate these claims. We have been advised back from Australia Post through the International Mail Exchange that there are no hold-ups that they are aware of in relation to the free mail system into East Timor. But I repeat my request: if anyone has an example and you know where they are, come and give us the information. Then I can only say that the Labor Party does have a commitment to supporting the government, to supporting the free mail system to our troops in East Timor. If you have an example bring it to us, rather than play cheap politics. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, the government's 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act allowed for states and territories to develop alternative laws to deal with native title as part of their day-to-day management of land. The Queensland government requested the Attorney-General to make 13 determinations under the Native Title Act in respect of their proposed alternative right to negotiate provisions. After careful consideration, and in accordance with the legislation, the Attorney has come to the view that the proposed Queensland alternative right to negotiate native title provisions comply with the Native Title Act. The determinations will be tabled today in the House and in the Senate. The determinations are important because they provide certainty for all those involved. The real question that the Australian people are entitled to ask is whether Labor intends to support their Queensland colleagues and allow the legislation to pass or whether they will instead re-open a divisive debate in relation to native title. The Leader of the Opposition was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 19 April as saying that Labor had not made up its mind on this issue. He was reported as saying:  The Labor Party would decide its attitude when the government gave its view on the state regime.Despite pleas from the Queensland Premier for some consistency - we have not yet heard from the opposition, but they will have that opportunity - I just want members to be aware of what the Queensland Premier has said. I quote the Australian Financial Review. He said: If this regime is disallowed, it would be the most savage slug to the mining industry in a generation. It would force mining offshore, it would destroy jobs. We are hoping it will get the support of the Federal Labor opposition and the government and the Democrats. If Labor rejects these proposed laws it would obviously be very costly to them. That is a matter that I simply note in the Queensland context. The Queensland government first passed its legislation in 1998. It was flawed. It had to be significantly rewritten. There has been a great deal of time in which to be able to consider this issue, to consult in relation to it, but to date we have heard nothing about this matter from the opposition. It is important. I note that the shadow minister said fairly recently, when he was on the Sunday program on 9 April, that the Labor Party saw amendments to the Native Title Act as being `racially discriminatory'. But when he was pressed on the matter as to whether Labor would repeal them, he was unable to give that commitment. It is important in terms of consistency to recognise that in relation to this legislation, where we get no comment about whether or not it would be repealed, the opposition allowed determinations in relation to two areas in Lightning Ridge in New South Wales to pass without being disallowed. So they assert that this is racially discriminatory but they have allowed determinations through in relation to New South Wales. When it comes to other parts of Australia, the Northern Territory, they have refused it, and they are silent in relation to Queensland. The test is here. The test will be whether the Labor Party are prepared to commit themselves to taking tough decisions in this matter, whether they are going to be consistent and whether they are going to take a sensible approach - one that is in the national interest - and support this regime that has been developed in accordance with the native title law. </DOC>

 - I welcome the opportunity given by the honourable member for Melbourne to make some comments in respect of the audit report that was tabled yesterday. I would like to start off by indicating that the processes in respect of foreign exchange risk management were in place in a similar fashion for, I think, the first 99 years of the Commonwealth government. They changed under the Howard government. They changed as a result of the Howard government bringing forward changes to the audit act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act. - Mr Speaker, I noted that in a press conference given a short time before question time the member for Cunningham was asked, `What did you do when you were in government? What did Labor do when Labor was in government?' and he said, `We followed the processes of the time.'  - Mr Speaker, as I indicated, under the Howard government the Financial Management and Accountability Act was brought forward. What that Financial Management and Accountability Act did was make it very clear to all agencies that they had a responsibility at agency level to, in fact, manage all matters that came within their purview, within their responsibility. They have to do that in a responsible and an accountable manner. That includes, of course, each agency being responsible for foreign exchange risk management. Following on from that act, a direction was given to all agencies effective from 1 July, 1999. So for the first 99 years, nothing. When you wanted to get some funding in respect of another currency, you asked the finance department - and I am sure the honourable Leader of the Opposition remembers this - `Could you please acquire for us the amount we need from the Reserve Bank?' and the finance department went to the Reserve Bank: they got the money; it was paid. That was the process that went on for 99 years. It went on when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance. When the Leader of the Opposition was the defence minister, the same process was in place at that stage. But from 1 July last year the responsibility, including the management of foreign exchange risk, was placed upon all agencies and a direction was given that made it abundantly clear that, for the first time through the Reserve Bank, they could get advice and they were entitled to hedge. I will not embarrass the honourable member for Cunningham by going on about his comment when he was asked as to whether or not the government should hedge at the present time. I certainly do not want to get into that particular area but it was a most interesting response.The circular was given to all agencies, clear direction was given. When there were discussions with the Auditor-General in respect of the report that was tabled yesterday, the department considered it necessary to further clarify what the arrangements were to reinforce what was said a year earlier, and, in the context of that, a further direction was given. That indicated that the department was continuing to review it, on an ongoing basis, to ensure its completeness; that is, the current directions. It made it clear that agencies should continue to be required to consult with the Reserve Bank on the handling of major foreign exchange transactions. - I really wonder what the honourable member for Kingston gave by way of advice to former ministers for finance and former treasurers on this particular issue, because for 99 years nothing happened until this government came and gave some clear flexibility and directions. So, Mr Speaker, to come to the second part -  -  - Let me just conclude on the Auditor-General's report in respect of one of the matters which both the department of finance and Treasury indicated they were more than happy to accept as a recommendation. That is, should there be centralised management of this process? Both departments indicated quite clearly that they thought that was worth consideration. I assure you that both I and the Treasurer will examine that thoroughly to the extent that -  -  - I will not go back over that. The honourable member for Melbourne then spoke about offshore property management. I can indicate quite clearly that some of the practices referred to in the audit report were practices inherited by the department of finance, and I might say that they were very much put in place from - and referred to - Labor's days. They related to the exposure that was there on long-term building contracts offshore and the exposure that was there because of the particular financial instruction that was in place. I can say those practices no longer occur and I can say very clearly there is now in place a process - a process for the first time in 99 years - under this government to examine and thoroughly ensure that, as best as one can manage the fluctuations that are constantly there, that is now able to be done. It was not under Labor.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can report to the House that the government is making good progress on implementing business taxation reform. On 1 July the company tax rate will fall from 36 per cent to 34 per cent and, 12 months later, to 30 per cent. In September of last year, capital gains tax liability was cut in half for individuals, that is, individuals need to pay capital gains tax on only half of their gain. In addition, in September last year we simplified and streamlined capital gains tax concessions for small business. We are replacing accelerated depreciation with effective life depreciation. We have introduced incentives for venture capital, particularly US pension funds in Australia. We have fundamentally reformed the taxation of life insurance. We have introduced scrip for scrip rollover relief. We have introduced measures which will allow the refund of unused imputation credits from 1 July, and we now have before the House measures in relation to tax shelters addressing the alienation of personal services income and non-commercial losses. I answered a question from the honourable independent member about that a moment ago. I might have said in that answer that one of the tests was profits in two of five years; I should have said three out of five years.In addition to that, the Ralph review of business taxation recommended high-level reform, sometimes known as the tax value method, or option 2. The government sees considerable merit in these high-level reforms and has given in-principle support to their introduction. We have set up a group which was chaired by Mr Dick Warburton to discuss the implementation and what would be required in relation to these particular high-level reforms. Mr Warburton - and I pay tribute to his work - presented a report to the government indicating to the government that there was considerable merit in these proposals. He recommended that an extensive educational process be undergone and that the proposals be worked in consultation with business.The objective would be to progress the practical implementation of this approach such that it could be ready by 1 July 2001.That is the government's position: to work hand in hand with business, to engage in extensive consultation. We recognised that it would take considerable education. It is a very large project because it changes the nature of what would be considered taxable away from the old concepts of income and capital much more to a new accounting standard which would certainly be simpler, which would be more efficient but would require a great deal of consultation and education for businesses to be able to operate under it. The government continues its work hand in hand with business in relation to these reforms. We will be announcing further steps for consultation and education in the near future so that we can be in a position where we can be ready for the introduction of those measures by 1 July 2001 - the earliest period in which those changes would begin to take place.</DOC>

 - Again, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the matters raised by the honourable member for Melbourne. I welcome that report. I believe that report is timely. I believe it points out that for many years we had a system in terms of foreign exchange, foreign currency and the management of risk that was simply a case of `Purchase it when you need it' and `You get your dividend with the ups and downs on the basis of the Reserve Bank's trading and the dividend that ultimately they give to the government.' Clearly, a specific responsibility was given to agencies to manage. Who knows better than the agency itself as to what the forward obligations are in any contracts? Clearly, many of the contracts in Defence are of a long duration. The time from the signing the contract to the delivery of the capital equipment can be a very long time, and frequently it is acquired offshore.As I have indicated, there is a clear responsibility for each agency to ensure that they manage this risk. There is also an obligation on them to get advice from the Reserve Bank. They also have the flexibility to seek advice elsewhere. So for the first time that is given; it is not a case simply of acquiring it when you need it but of managing the process properly and getting the appropriate advice which is in line with the commercial process. Should there be central agency supervision of this? As I indicated in my last answer, both Finance and Treasury indicated that was worth looking at, and I assure you that both the respective ministers - the Treasurer and I - will have a good look at that to see if there is an additional role that may assist. The simple fact is, as the report itself indicated, that there is a fluctuation up, a fluctuation down, and I noted throughout the report - in fact, if one goes back through history - there was a heck of a lot of support for the Labor budgets of the late eighties and early nineties on the basis of the value of the Australian dollar and the trading of the Reserve Bank. But those days are gone to the extent that there is a capacity to manage now this particular trading, and I assure you this government is doing it much better than its predecessor did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for his question. I think it is very important that we encourage small business to give people a job; and the system of unfair dismissal today does not in, in my view, do that. We have had a lot of evidence made available to us repeatedly that, if the small business community had a complete exemption from the unfair dismissal law, they would go out and give people a job - in fact, 50,000 jobs. It is time that that matter was brought to a head in the Senate.I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has said that workplace relations will be an issue at the next election. The last Labor leader who said that was Paul Keating, before the 1996 election, and he specifically mentioned unfair dismissal. He was so embarrassed by his own policy that, during the election, he announced a review of the very system which we have been trying to fix up and have done a lot to, in the time that we have been in. But, on each and every occasion, we have been thwarted in the Senate by the Labor Party who again are against the interests of small business and do what the trade union leaders say - and the people who suffer are the 50,000 people who would otherwise have a job. The Leader of the Opposition says that Labor's policy would be like Queensland's. Look at what has happened in Queensland: one of the first things the Beattie government did was remove an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. The impact of that is that, instead of reaching his five per cent target, that decision alone will be one of the factors that continues to see employment stagnate in the state of Queensland. Just to put a practical aspect to this, though, I did get a very interesting letter from a bloke who runs a workplace relations consultancy, I gather, up in the Hunter region. - Near Scone, I presume - up in that area. He had 43 small businesspeople come in to his business recently to talk about workplace relations, and about three-quarters of them were former trade union members who have gone into small business. He was asking them about the changes that they thought were necessary to help them run their businesses and create more jobs. This is what he said:The 43 firms present collectively would immediately employ up to 57 people if the fear of an unfair dismissal could be removed.It is about time that the Labor Party realised the importance of small business to creating jobs. It is no good saying that you want to see jobs created and then voting against the things which would help small business do that very task - that is, to create jobs for the unemployed. We are committed to it. It is going to be an issue, and it will be an issue in Scone and in every hamlet and regional area around the country. It is another difference between us: we are for small business, and the Labor Party is for the trade union leadership.</DOC>

 - The Department of Defence, when it pays accounts overseas, does so in accordance with the procedures that have been carried out for very many years. Any losses or wins are no loss to the defence department. Therefore, the assumption that you are making - that certain reductions in projects were the cause of exchange rate blow-outs - is totally incorrect. While we are on finance - because you are the people who raised this matter - in the last six years of the Labor government, you dropped defence spending as a percentage of GDP from 2.3 per cent to 1.8 per cent. You did nothing about personnel, you did nothing about projects, you did nothing about acquisition, and you did nothing about managing the hard things in Defence: you walked right away from them. At the same time as you dropped funding for defence, you encouraged acquisitions and personnel which you could not afford; and that is one of the reasons the department is in such a mess.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. The government has made available some $259 million over three years to the universities under the workplace reform program. The University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and Monash University have each been awarded $4 million under this program, for flexible agreements that they have recently entered into. I congratulate these universities. Unfortunately for students, yet again the National Tertiary Education Union, the NTEU, supported by its bedfellows in the Labor Party and by the Leader of the Opposition, are actively campaigning to undermine the capacity of the universities to offer improved services to students and the flexibilities they need to meet the challenges of this century. The NTEU has insisted on pattern bargaining; it is opposed to local level agreements, which are designed to meet the needs of staff and students. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the statement by the Vice-Chancellor of Southern Queensland University, Peter Swannell, who has written to his staff saying the following:The action of the national executive of the NTEU is totally deplorable. All parties in the single bargaining unit have negotiated in good faith, in cordial spirit and achieved a mutually acceptable outcome. This is in the exact spirit of a local enterprise agreement. I will not allow this excellent outcome to be frustrated by a national executive led by Mr Graeme McCulloch in Melbourne.This is the union that boasts on its web site the fact that it has banned students from sitting examinations, that it has conducted 24 days of strike action at universities and rolling strikes during this year, doing huge damage to these institutions and their capacity to meet the needs of students. Why is the Labor Party silent about the actions of the NTEU? One of the reasons is the 10 Labor members and senators who are former union officials, including the member for Brisbane over there, a former official of an education union; the member for Burke up there, the continual interjector; Senator Carr, spreading the union line in the Senate estimates committees; and Senator Faulkner. All of them former education -  - These former education union officials of course will not stand up for their universities because they know that the union is critical to their election strategy. They invite the union into their offices, they use taxpayer funded resources to put out propaganda on behalf of the unions. This is very clear. I have here a press release from Carolyn Allport, the National President of the National Tertiary Education Union.  - I was asked about impediments to the workplace reform program within the universities. One of the greatest impediments is the action of the National Tertiary Education Union and its alliance with the Australian Labor Party. I was just drawing the House's attention to the fact that the National Tertiary Education Union is being actively assisted by the members of the Labor Party, the former union officials, to send out their propaganda. I have here a media release from the National Tertiary Education Union sent out on 9 May 2000, intended to go the Sydney Morning Herald and faxed out from the office of none other than J.E. Gillard MP, former union lawyer, using taxpayers' money to support the activities of the National Tertiary Education Union. So we have here the direct alliance between the union and the Labor Party. If the Leader of the Opposition had the strength to stand up to the unions and declare the independence of the Labor Party, our universities might be able to get on with their enterprise bargaining and help the students to get the services they need. </DOC>

 - The government deeply deplores and is disturbed by events in the Solomon Islands. Any action taken in line with the type of action that has occurred in Fiji is deplored by the government. This action, in particular, which sees the Prime Minister and the Governor-General being held, is completely abhorrent to the Australian government. In relation to the member's question, a joint team of Australian and New Zealand officials arrived in the Solomon Islands on Saturday morning to review the circumstances. We agreed, in sending those people there, to see what circumstances might be in place and to see how we could respond to them. There was an undertaking given that we would fund up to 50 police officers to go to the Solomon Islands to maintain law and order. That is still, of course, being looked at. As members would be aware, the original proposition envisaged some Fijian police going as a contingent as well. That, in view of the circumstances in Fiji, is no longer viable and we are now looking at other areas to fill those numbers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I had the privilege yesterday of attending the celebration of World Environment Day, hosted by Australia for the first time ever in Adelaide. I had the opportunity of witnessing the World Environment Day Global 500 Awards, which are given to people who make a significant contribution to environmental policies all around the world.It is timely that we record the achievements in aid of improving the environment that have been reached during the four and a bit years that this government has been in office. I am particularly proud, as are all members, of the way in which this government has been able to balance a proper concern for the environment with the cause of job creation and economic development. It is very important that you strike that balance. We have been able to initiate many new policies in relation to the environment whilst maintaining a very fast rate of economic growth and generating close to 700,000 new jobs. I can inform the member who asked me the question that in 2000-01 the Commonwealth will spend $1,004 million on environmental policies. This compares with $508 million spent on environmental policies during the last year of the former government's term. Annual environmental spending has in fact doubled in five years, with significant increases in funding for many environmental problems. We will spend almost $1 billion over four years on reducing greenhouse gases and promoting new renewable energy sources - the largest per capita amount in the world.The Natural Heritage Trust is a $1.5 billion effort to repair the environment in a number of areas such as coasts, oceans, rivers, degraded land and biodiversity. Australia's first oceans policy, to provide scientifically based outcomes to protect the marine habitat and promote sustainable development, supported by over $150 million of spending on ocean care, is another policy of which the government is particularly proud. There are improved vehicle emission standards to reduce air pollution from cars and trucks, and our regional forest agreements have put into reserve around 2.5 million hectares of additional precious forest, whilst also promoting new investment in forest industries. We have also, as an Australian first, introduced a new philanthropy incentive to encourage property donations to environmental organisations - something that the Labor Party in the Senate has endeavoured to obstruct and frustrate.So I can say to the member for Riverina on this World Environment Day that in the four years or more that the government has been in office we have given the high priority to care for the environment that we promised during the 1996 election campaign but we have not done that in a fanatical way at the expense of economic growth and jobs. It is a pretty successful claim to be able to say that you have doubled environmental spending but you have also maintained strong economic growth and generated 700,000 more jobs. That is not a trifecta of which our opponents could readily boast in 13 years.</DOC>

 - Needless to say, I have not read the member's letter at all but I am very aware of the enormous effort that the government has put into affairs in the Solomon Islands. We have been acutely aware for some considerable time of the deteriorating situation. It is for that reason that we agreed to fund the Commonwealth initiative there. We funded meetings in that area and, as late as Saturday morning, we deployed, with New Zealand, a team there to assess what next could possibly be done in what was clearly a difficult situation. I believe that everything we have done so far completely covers anything that he might have said. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. The ANZ job advertisement series for May was released today, showing that job advertisements increased 3.9 per cent in May and are 12.6 per cent higher than they were one year ago. The average number of job ads is now at its highest level since December 1989, which was the previous peak before the Labor Party's recession of 1990. The ANZ reports that recent trends in newspaper job advertising remain consistent with employment growth averaging 16,000 over the next three months. The author of the series estimates that they are consistent with a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ per cent in September of this year. The government's own forecasts have unemployment falling to 6¼ per cent by June of next year, and so that forecast would be somewhat stronger than the government's own forecasts.Nearly 700,000 new jobs have been created in Australia since the coalition came to office in March 1996. The unemployment rate, now at 6.8 per cent, is the lowest level in a decade - the lowest level since the Labor Party recession of 1990. That is the result of good, sound macro-economic policy not only ensuring that the budgets are in surplus, keeping interest rates down and getting low inflation, but also instituting labour market reform - which would be totally threatened and wrecked by Labor if it ever got itself back into a position of influence.In addition, I notice that in the United States on Friday there was data indicating that the US economy may be moderating somewhat. Unemployment rose to 4½ per cent from 3.9 per cent, and payrolls data was under expectations. This has been interpreted by markets as meaning that interest rates will not be hiked to the extent previously thought likely in the United States, and it has meant that the US dollar, which has been exceptionally strong against all currencies, has come back somewhat against all currencies, including the Australian dollar, over the weekend. Although the government forecasts that growth will moderate somewhat in Australia from its recent record-breaking run above four per cent, the government believes that growth will continue in the high threes - 3¾ per cent - consistent with continued jobs creation, new job opportunities, lowering unemployment and benefits to people who are seeking work in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. Implicit in what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is that, in some way, the events in Fiji and the Solomon Islands are related to my non-attendance at the last two meetings of the South Pacific Forum. Let me say that that is the kind of superficial analysis of foreign affairs and the kind of knee-jerk automatic negativism for which the Leader of the Opposition is now becoming notorious. What you do, according to the Leader of the Opposition, if you want to be a successful opposition leader, is just automatically criticise the government on everything: whenever something happens, it is always the government's fault - and if you can draw some kind of tiny connection between some completely unrelated event -  - The Deputy Leader of  the Opposition is interjecting about the GST. I thought the question was about the South Pacific Forum. Let me make it very clear that all the attendance of which the former government boasted in relation to the South Pacific Forum did not in any way affect the events that transpired in Fiji in 1987. If the Leader of the Opposition and the former foreign affairs minister, now removed to Paris - or Brussels or wherever it is that he is trying to pour oil on troubled waters and resolve disputes - go back and examine the remarks that were made at the time, and the defence that was offered on that occasion in relation to any criticism that may have been offered to them at that time, they will see that of course the events in Fiji were in no way events for which the then Australian government was responsible. If you want a serious debate on foreign affairs in this country, do not insult the Australian people with trivial criticism. If you want a serious discussion about these issues then to suggest that in some way non-attendance is the cause of these events is completely absurd. But, as the Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the events in the Solomon Islands and the events in Fiji, let me take this opportunity to say on behalf of the government - and, I am sure, on behalf of all Australian people - that we are very concerned about this morning's events in the Solomon Islands. We utterly condemn the kidnapping of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General by armed militants with assistance from elements of the police. The government is as concerned about that situation as it is about the events in Fiji. The events in Fiji are essentially a reaction by the indigenous Fijians against any suggestion that they should share political power with the Indo-Fijian people of that country. Their reaction is racially based. Mr Speight and his supporters clearly want a racial constitution in Fiji. That is quite unacceptable to the Australian government. But, in the final analysis, we have to make certain that any response we give to that situation, as to the situation in the Solomon Islands, is consistent with recognising the right of countries ultimately to make decisions about their own future and to make decisions as to whether foreigners should involve themselves in the internal affairs of those countries. I would imagine that at no stage would the Labor Party support a proposition that we should insert ourselves other than by the invitation of governments. - I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the member for Kingsford-Smith that this rather puny attempt to blame the government for events that have transpired is absolutely contemptible and will have no substance in the eyes of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. The truth of the matter is that apparently we are now going to see the Labor Party finally unveiling their policy of roll-back on GST. Senator Sherry told the Senate on 13 May 1999:The Labor Party's tax policy will be presented to a national conference which is now scheduled for July-August next year.So in a month's time they are going to present their tax policy. Senator Sherry said:That is when our tax policy will be presented to the Australian electorate for consideration. We are not developing our tax policy on the run.That is fair enough. They had a year from 13 May 1999 and now they are going to unveil it, according to Senator Sherry, in July or August at the national conference. The Leader of the Opposition said the same thing on the 7.30 Report of 23 February. He said:People are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we're going. They're also entitled to know exactly what we'd do in the next term of government with the GST. People are entitled to know it and not be deceived. They are entitled to know it and not be deceived. I guess the first inclination of how people were going to be told about the Leader of the Opposition's roll-back policy came with AMWU Secretary, Doug Cameron. When you are in doubt about Labor policy, always go to the trade union movement; they are the people who know. Doug Cameron, the AMWU Secretary, the man who gives the orders to the Labor Party, was on Meet the Press on Sunday. He was asked this question:On the GST, how far would you expect a Labor government to roll back a GST?Cameron: A long way. A long way.Journalist: Could you outline how much?Cameron: I think the Labor Party should really look at the fundamentals.Journalist: What specifically would you like removed?Cameron: We certainly don't believe there should be a tax on clothing.One point seven billion dollars worth of roll-back. No tax on fur coats, no tax on Zegna suits under the Labor Party: $1.7 billion worth of roll-back - of course completely unfunded, except by rolling up income taxes. The Leader of the Opposition was out there this morning making this claim:The GST will take $25 billion out of future budget surpluses.The GST actually raises money. But the Leader of the Opposition said:It takes more than $25 billion out of future budget surpluses.He said he would prefer to spend that $25 billion. What he actually meant was income tax cuts. Income tax cuts are what take money out of revenue and give it back to the Australian people. Your claim that you would like to spend more is a claim that you would like to increase income taxes so you could spend more. The old Labor Party way - tax and spend. And another $1.7 billion of roll-back on clothing by the ACTU.For two years now we have had this farce from the Australian Labor Party that it is so opposed to GST that if it ever gets elected it is going to keep it and then roll it back in some undefined, uncosted, unpronounced, confused, ill-considered way. This is a party which has no position on taxation, no position on economic responsibility, does not have a policy thread to pull together, and now apparently is going to go to its national conference in July and August and tell us about its tax policy. All I can say is we cannot wait to see the Labor Party tax policy. We cannot wait to see it in July and August. We cannot wait to cost it. We cannot wait to hold the Labor Party accountable for once in its life.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition I would make the point that the adjustment of the age pension has been strictly in accordance with the legislation - sponsored for the first time by a coalition government; never done by Labor. Labor never introduced legislation to this effect. Labor never introduced legislation of this kind. We brought the legislation in, and the pensions have been adjusted strictly in accordance with that legislation. Of course, one of the features of wage movements under this government compared with wage movements under the former government is they have actually gone up under us. Under the former government you had treasurers and industrial relations ministers running around the country boasting about how they cut the wages of average Australian workers. I am very proud to say that we have lifted the wages of average workers and we have done so in a completely non-inflationary way.The Leader of the Opposition's question allows me to remind the House again of the really good news for the pensioners of Australia that will arrive on 1 July, because there will be an up-front four per cent increase. No matter how excited the member for Lilley and the Leader of the Opposition may get, nothing alters the fact that on 1 July there will be an up-front increase of four per cent. And there will, over the months and the years that follow under the policies of this government, be a permanently guaranteed two per cent real increase in the level of the pension. That is something that the former government was not able to deliver. It is something of which this government is proud, and it is one other example of the fact that this government has delivered on the commitments it made to maintain intact and to enhance the social security safety net in this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have been doing my research, and it is interesting to note that there has in fact been no alternative policy espoused by a government in respect of this issue of enterprise bargaining. If you go back to when Labor was in government and introduced enterprise bargaining, all of the speeches of Paul Keating and the like said that we should have enterprise bargaining at the single enterprise level. In fact, if you take out the 1993 legislation there is an explanatory memorandum that was circulated on the authority of none other than the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, sitting on the opposition front bench. This is what it says on page 73:The circumstances in which the right to strike is protected by this act are limited to circumstances where the industrial action is related to enterprise bargaining.It really should not come as a surprise, but the fact is that no government in this country has ever advocated industry-wide strikes. No government has ever said that the right to strike ought to be so widely defined that you could have industrial disputes right across an industry, of the sort of course we did once have in the 1970s and which did so much damage to the Australian economy. -  - The shadow minister says tell us another one. In 1993 the Labor Party's policy was opposed to industrial action in pursuit of multi-employer agreements. It is only now that they are in opposition - where they are bound hand and foot to the ACTU - that they have decided to change a policy which they themselves once advocated. That is why you are seeing headlines such as we have seen over the last few days from most of our major newspapers: the Courier-Mail, `Beazley stumbles under union pressure'; the Sydney Morning Herald editorial, `Beazley bows to the unions'; the Daily Telegraph, `Stepping back to the dark days'; the Australian, Friday, `Beazley fails industrial reform test'; Wednesday, `ALP caves in to unions over contracts'; Wednesday, `Beazley yields to unions on individual contracts'; and again on the weekend, `Beazley losing the plot for Labor and the future'. Then, just to cap it off - I love those articles written by journalists after they have been speaking to people on the Labor Party side - this journalist, Michael Bachelard, in the Australian has been speaking to the frontbench, and this is what he said when Labor's capitulation to the unions was announced:The response from Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith was swift, fierce and predictable: Beazley lacks ticker; his policy speech was 'written and authorised by the ACTU'.But here is the inside comment:People high up in Beazley's leadership group fear Reith is right ...Absolutely. Just to show how weak this man is, it does not matter how excessively, how much, they have capitulated to the unions, their fall-back strategy is that the Democrats would not let such legislation ever get through. This is the deep throat within the Labor Party and here is the quote: Labor insiders say, deeply off the record - yeah, sure - that that outcome would not disappoint them. Then it would just be a case of handling the unions' disappointment.They know it is wrong. They have got a weak leader caving in to the unions, and the people who will suffer are the very employees they claim to represent for the loss of jobs and the loss of investment.</DOC>

 - I reject the claim made by the member for Lilley that the promise has been broken. We legislated and pensions are being maintained fully in accordance with that legislation. As far as the government's information campaign is concerned, it passes strange that a party that daily demands more and more information about a major change to the Australian taxation system should complain when a government provides that information. It is the largest change in Australia's history, it deserves a large information campaign, and that is exactly what you have asked for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. In question time last week I pointed out that Kim Beazley had made a foolish error in his budget reply when he claimed that Commonwealth spending on education had fallen from 2.2 per cent of GDP five years ago to 1.8 per cent this year. This relies virtually entirely on an error that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition. - Just wait. You did not even listen to the answer correctly, so now I am going to correct you a second time. The Leader of the Opposition's error was to overlook the fact that the earlier figure of - are you listening to this? You must get it right this time -  - I felt sure that you were, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition's error was to overlook the fact that the earlier figure of 2.2 per cent included Austudy and that Austudy had been transferred during that five-year period to social security and was not included in the figure of 1.8 per cent. On 29 May I tried to tell the Leader of the Opposition that the statistic on which he had so carelessly relied and failed to check was wrong. But, as the weekend's speech to the Labor Party conference in Victoria shows and as the Labor Party's web site today shows, he is still getting it wrong. He showed over the weekend that he still does not understand. In fact, he was at great pains - and this is a very embarrassing transcript of the Victorian Labor Party conference - to explain to the conference that the 1.8 per cent of GDP was now 1.9 per cent. He missed the point completely. It was the 2.2 per cent that was wrong, as I clearly stated to the House last time, and that that 2.2 per cent on the same basis when you are not comparing apples and oranges is 1.9 per cent. He did not go away and check it the first time - he relied on the member for Dobell, who cannot be relied upon - and he did not bother when he used the figure again to even refresh his memory about what I had put on the record in the House in question time on 29 May.  To make the error the first time was carelessness; to make it a second time was stupidity. It shows that the Leader of the Opposition is so careless with the truth and so incompetent that he does not care to go away and check the most basic facts on which his whole attack on the government's education spending relies. This is not a minor fact; this is the absolute foundation of his case against the government. In fact, when the rapid growth of gross domestic product is taken into account, we find that there has been a 15 per cent real increase in education spending during the lifetime of this government - a 15 per cent real increase in Commonwealth expenditure on education -   - Go away and do it if it surprises you. You cannot even be bothered checking the facts. What more do I need to do? Do I bring in a chalkboard to show the Leader of the Opposition or do I really just need to convince the puppeteers: Carolyn Allport of the ATEU, Sharan Burrow of the ACTU, Dennis Fitzgerald of the AEU - the Cazza, Shazza and Dezza show. They are the ones who are running the ALP, and I had better convince them because you obviously do not even understand the simplest facts.</DOC>

 - There will be a four per cent increase, and pensions will always be two per cent ahead of CPI increases. It is as simple as that. No attempt by those who sit opposite to manipulate and distort the truth can alter that fundamental fact. There is a four per cent increase. Pensioners will always be two per cent in real terms ahead of increases in the cost of living. That is a level of support that has never been afforded by any government in Australia's history before.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and for her support for the latest Work for the Dole project recently announced in her electorate. Work for the Dole is of course one of the signature programs and significant successes of the Howard government. The government regards participation in Work for the Dole as a good thing in itself. Work for the Dole is not just a means to an end. Nevertheless, paid employment outcomes arising from participation in Work for the Dole are a very welcome by-product of this great program. I have previously reported to the House that, based on the 10,000-place pilot program, 34 per cent of participants were in paid employment three months after leaving their projects. I am now able to tell the House that, based on the 27,000 participants who left projects in 1999, 32 per cent of them were in paid employment three months after leaving. This compares with just 21 per cent paid employment outcomes for new work opportunities programs under the former government. This very strong result has come about despite the fact that the percentage of very long-term unemployed has risen from 30 per cent in the pilot program to 42 per cent last year.I have been asked about alternative views. The Leader of the Opposition said of the government's employment services policies:... I've got enough knowledge of this to know that failure in this system that's been established by this Government is virtually inevitable.He said that failure was virtually inevitable. Certainly I would concede that the Leader of the Opposition has had some deep insights into professional failure. He was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training when unemployment hit 11.2 per cent. He was the defender of the union bloc vote and the socialisation objective. Last week, to get some cheers from a union audience, he was responsible for the biggest surrender since Singapore. The employment outcomes of Work for the Dole are at least 50 per cent better than comparable Working Nation programs and still Labor's policy, as always, is simply to go back to the past. The member for Dickson, whom I welcome back to the House, has been repeatedly demanding that accredited training be made a compulsory part of Work for the Dole programs. Based on the costs of accredited training under Working Nation, making it a compulsory part of Work for the Dole would cost up to $2,000 per participant or an extra $100 million a year. That is on top of the $600 million a year more that her changes to the Job Network would cost. This is $700 million more that the member for Dickson wants to spend on employment services. This money would not go to job seekers; it would go to the TAFE system. This money is not designed to benefit job seekers; it is designed to benefit the Australian Education Union's membership dues. It just shows how completely committed the members opposite are to government of the unions, by the unions and for the unions.</DOC>

 - I welcome the opportunity to refer again to the Auditor-General's report of last week. Before getting to that, let me say one simple thing. I assure all members on all sides of the House that I will be as focused on my duties as I have always been and far less distracted by such peripheral things than the Leader of the Opposition was when he contemplated his change of seat a few years ago.I come to the substantial part of the question, the Auditor-General's report. As I said in the House last week, the government welcomes this report and will look at it very closely. In fact, the government has established a task force consisting of the Department of Finance and Administration, Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury -  - and also the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to look at all of the recommendations -  - to bring the matter forward for government's further consideration in a month's time. But, whilst this matter of the Auditor-General's report is before the House, let me simply point out one thing. The matters referred to by the opposition in the House last week in respect of foreign currency management risk related to a period of many years. I draw the opposition's attention to that report and recommend that they might look at the various aspects of that report - be they in Defence, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or in AusAID - and that they go back to the period of time over which the Auditor-General examined these issues. It may well be that an examination of those figures contained in the report will draw some very specific attention to people sitting on that side of the House and their management of the finances, particularly in the mid-eighties and subsequently during that 13-year period when Labor was in government.  As I made it clear last week in the House, the government will examine all of the recommendations quite thoroughly, as we do in respect of all reports that come from the Auditor-General. But to simply take selected lines, newspapers headlines and indicate that there is a conclusion that can be drawn in no way has any relevance to the period of time in which this government has been responsible for the financial management of our budgets and the taxpayers' money. I can assure you that the reforms that this government is very proud of have benefited the Australian community in a way that Labor could only think about. They could never do it. They were going to bring through accrual accounting year after year but never did it. It simply did not happen - like so many of those matters they were going to do. They mismanaged the Australian budget, and that audit report refers to a period of time in which Labor were in government, so I invite the honourable member who is concerned about me personally to focus on that issue. Don't worry about me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Sometimes in health you get a bit of good news. In a report released overnight in Geneva by the World Health Organisation, Australia certainly did have some good news. When you look at life expectancy of healthy years of life and adjust for years of disability, Australia in fact has the second longest life expectancy in the world. This work was done by Chris Murray at the Harvard School of Public Health. Since 1975 in Australia the life expectancy of an adult male has gone up by eight years, which is an extraordinary increase: one year of life expectancy for every three calendar years.There are two reasons Australia ranks so high internationally. The first is our comprehensive universal health care system. The second is the strong public health programs we run. The universal health care system today has costs relatively under control, with health as a percentage of GDP as constant. We have a strong mix of public and private health care provision, the third highest private health care provision in the old OECD of 24 Western countries. Ageing is the least of the three factors in terms of driving population growth, something good for people who are approaching those years themselves. The fourth is we have a very strong evidence base for putting new items onto our health care system, and it is run by science, not by politics. I can very proudly say on behalf of the government that at least three of these four things have improved dramatically in the last four years since the Howard government came to office.In the public health programs: we are world leaders in diabetes, with the National Diabetes Health Strategy; in immunisation, we have improved from being 68th in the Western world for completed childhood immunisation in 1995; we are now into the third national HIV strategy; and we are about to launch a hepatitis C strategy that I believe will be the first in the world. On harm focused strategies, we can take great credit for reducing the rate of smoking, which the World Health Organisation itself attributes as one of  the most significant factors behind this extraordinarily good figure. The rate of smoking in Australia dropped throughout much of the 1980s but by 1990 the drop had stopped. This situation applied till 1997 when the rate of smoking in Australia stalled at about 23.8 per cent of the adult population. Because of the tobacco strategy we have run jointly with state and territory governments, there has once again been a drop. We are now down to about 21.8 per cent of the population, which is a very good result internationally - not as good as some parts of the United States but an extraordinary result for a whole country.  It is not totally a surprise that we should do so well. Last year when I was in Washington, the ambassador organised a lunch for me with groups interested in health care reform. They rated from the left of the political spectrum, the Kaiser Family Foundation, to the right of the political spectrum, the Heritage Foundation. The universal view from the left to the right was that Australia had probably the most enviable health care system in the world. This was incredibly encouraging because 24 hours later the six premiers and two chief ministers came out and said that Australia's health care was in need of massive reform and we had to start again. The point is that we do not need massive reform in Australia's health care system. We need sensible, incremental, progressive reform to build on what we have had in the past. I would like to be able to compare and contrast the policies of the government with those of the opposition, but of course that is impossible because for the last 18 months we have not seen an original idea in health care from the opposition. We very much look forward to their national convention, and we will be able to judge them then on whether they have done anything in the last 18 months.</DOC>

 - There is nothing that gets the member for Dobell to his feet more quickly than a National Union of Students campaign. Let me make several points in answer to the member for Dobell. One is that HECS is GST free. There will be no GST charged on HECS. There will be no GST-inclusive index used in relation to the indexation of the HECS repayment thresholds. The system for indexing HECS debt has not changed from the system introduced by the Labor Party. There is no change whatever to the indexation of the HECS debt according to the CPI.Students have benefited enormously from the low rate of inflation that has resulted from the economic management policies of this government. For example, if we look at the indexation of HECS debts over the last three years, because of low inflation, a student with a HECS debt of $10,000 will have paid something like $613 less than under Labor's higher inflation. In fact, a student with a HECS debt of $20,000 would have paid $1,200 less. These are major benefits to students arising from the government's very good economic management.Also as a result of the new tax system, around 80 per cent of Australians will be paying a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. That means that a student who graduates and starts out next year on a salary of $28,000 will receive a tax cut of $762 per annum. This just shows the absurd scare talk that we hear from the Labor Party, and if, as we know, the National Union of Students were not conducting a campaign we would not have even got a question on this today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax. He will remember the Daily Telegraph heading last week about -  - Thank you, Prime Minister - `Reith the workers' friend'. It seems that the message has reached the trade union movement in Victoria -   - Sorry, Mr Speaker, I was just putting the article there. It seems that the message has reached none other than -  - the trade union movement in my home state of Victoria. - Whilst it is true that neither Michelle O'Neil or Bill Shorten, from the Right and the Left respectively, publicly supported me personally, I am very pleased to advise the House that there is growing support for the government's Employee Entitlements Support Scheme. This support was revealed in none other than the Labor Party's conference in Victoria over the weekend. Ms O'Neil said:In the absence of any immediately available alternative, it presented the best opportunity to protect workers and their entitlements in the short term.She is a left winger. It was reported that Bill Shorten, from the right wing, was in fact:... backing a motion for the Victorian Government to augment the Federal Government's Employee Entitlements Support Scheme.Just to confirm the fact that the federal opposition has no policy, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party said:Labor should finalise its own policy on the issue of protection for workers' entitlements.The fact is that unionists in Victoria know there is only one scheme available - that is, the federal government's scheme. What is surprising is that the one person who does not have a policy and who is not prepared to back this scheme is in fact none other than the Leader of the Opposition. And what does O'Neil say of that? She says, `You shouldn't turn your backs on workers.' No truer words could be said. It is time that the federal opposition finally did something for workers and stood up for this scheme. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition told Bob Carr in New South Wales and Steve Bracks in Victoria that they should actually do something to help workers just for a change.</DOC>

 - Let me repeat: there is absolutely no way in which the method for indexing the HECS debt has changed from the method that was used under the previous government; there is no change whatever. Students are major beneficiaries of the tax changes that the government is making. It is worth remembering that, under the Labor Party, HECS debts were indexed by rates of as much as eight per cent; and under this government HECS debts have been adjusted by no more than two per cent since 1997, and in 1998 they were adjusted downwards.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his forthright representation on behalf of sugar farmers in his electorate and in particular the farmers in the South Johnston area around Innisfail, who faced the potential of not having a mill to crush their cane this year. The South Johnston mill is facing serious financial difficulties and, without support, it would not have opened this season, and around 300 cane growers in the honourable member's electorate would not have been able to get some or all of their cane crushed this season. The federal government is naturally concerned about the impact that such a closure would have on workers, the farmers and the sugar communities in that region. So we have offered to underwrite a cane growers loan to provide the necessary capital to enable the crush to proceed, as scheduled, next month. In addition, there will be further financial support from the National Australia Bank to enable the mill to open as soon as the necessary infrastructure can be put in place. It is particularly disappointing that in this instance the Queensland state Labor government was prepared to do absolutely nothing. It seems as though it was going to allow the mill to close and the cane to simply rot in the field. That is disappointing. There was no-one from the Labor government prepared to stand up for the workers or for the farmers. Fortunately, this government has acted and provided a lifeline for the farmers in that area.This loan does not avoid the need for restructuring in North Queensland. In time for next season, there will have to be a significant restructuring of the milling capacity, and arrangements put in place. The industry acknowledges that. The board of South Johnston acknowledge it. The cane grower representatives in that area are now working towards developing a permanent regime to ensure that that area can continue to grow sugar and to crush it in a way in which there are satisfactory returns to growers and the communities as a whole. This is a significant step by the federal government to show its real concern for farmers in that area and to guarantee that their crop will be crushed this season.</DOC>

 - I have obviously been making further inquiries this morning, and one of the things I have been looking at is the `Guide to registering for the New Tax System', which does advise people what the circumstances are and what information will be available. You are also wrong in the premise of your question suggesting that much of this information has not been available in the past. The fact of the matter is that, for companies on the Australian company system with an ACN number, much of that information has been available. What is different is that, amongst other things, we are going from a paper based system to an Internet based system. One of the good things for small business is that a lot more information is more easily available through the Internet system, and obviously if you are in small business you do need to be able to verify numbers that are provided to you. The issue has been raised and we are obviously looking at it. If there is anything further to be said, it will be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his interest in this important matter. More than 4.2 million Australians are part of frequent flyer programs, and a lot of those programs have been associated with the use of credit cards over the last few years. In fact, over the last five years to March 2000, there has been a 37 per cent increase in bank credit cards. Now there are more than nine million credit cards in Australia. A survey by the Australian Consumers Association found that 60 per cent of Choice readers had changed their spending habits because of credit reward schemes. There are a number of different types of reward schemes in place. Of course, you can use reward points to redeem everything from a toaster through to clothes, whatever the case might be, but it seems that most Australians - certainly 4.2 million Australians - are using them to gain access to frequent flyer seats on commonly used routes at a domestic and international level. The domestic frequent flyer schemes are provided by Qantas and Ansett. There are, of course, the international alliances involving One World and Star.The key issues that the ACCC is looking at are the availability of flights and the timing of and restrictions on access to those flights. It needs to be pointed out to consumers that frequent flyer points do not come free; consumers pay for frequent flyer points. Therefore, they have a right to know when the seats are available, they have a right to know the information and they have a right to get access to those seats; having paid for frequent flyer points, they should be able to redeem them when they choose.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for his question, and I will take a few minutes to answer it and also provide the House with some further information regarding the situation which is unfolding in the Solomon Islands and include certain reports of clashes between the IFM and MEF earlier today. The reports of that, of course, are still coming in.As I informed the House yesterday, the government - and, I am sure, all members of the House - are concerned about what has unfolded in the Solomon Islands. We are particularly concerned about reports late this morning of clashes between rival militant groups near Honiara. We are aware of the suggestions that have been made by the member for Kingsford-Smith and his leader about the role of the government, and I will come to the greater detail of that in a moment. Our objective in relation to this has always been to assist the Solomon Islands to deal with its own problems by peaceful and democratic means, without foreign interference. The problem is a longstanding ethnic one, involving the people from Guadalcanal and from Malaita, and this root cause has to be addressed if there is to be a permanent solution to the crisis. It is not simply a security issue.Along with other countries in the region, Australia has done a very great deal since the crisis began over a year ago to this end. Indeed, no other country has made an equal or even comparable commitment. Australia's extensive assistance to the Solomon Islands government has included assistance to the government and the police both through our longstanding bilateral aid program, which is $17 million a year, and through direct assistance to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. We have provided $6 million over three years for ongoing training, restructuring and strengthening of the police force and the judicial system. We have also more than doubled the number of advisers on the ground. We have provided $710,000 for humanitarian relief for people displaced by the unrest. We have committed $800,000 to fund the Commonwealth police monitoring group comprising Fiji and Vanuatu police. Most importantly, we have been very actively assisting the Solomon Islands government to institute a peace process, including providing about $100,000 to support peace negotiations among the parties.On 3 June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer - following a meeting of the National Security Committee of Cabinet - despatched a team of officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence and the Australian Federal Police to make an assessment of the situation with a view to our supporting an increased Commonwealth police group in the Solomon Islands. That group is still in Honiara and in discussions with the high commission in relation to the crisis. It is true that the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands had called for armed and interventionist troops or police to put down the insurgency in Guadalcanal. That included a quite specific request for the deployment of Australian police to line positions in the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. That matter was considered by the government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated to the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands that the government of Australia did not believe it was appropriate for us to respond to that request.The request was not ignored. The request was directly addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a discussion with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands. The view was taken by the government - and I believe it to be a correct view - that it was not in our interest to put unarmed Australian police in the front line and at an unacceptable risk, particularly without any defined exit strategy. You do not willy-nilly commit the police of this country to a hostile situation without knowing what the exit strategy is. That may be the view of some who seek, with 20/20 hindsight, to make cheap political capital out of this issue, but that is not the considered response of the government. I think the government position was put very well on the AM program this morning by my colleague the member for Moore, who correctly described the statements made by the member for Denison as naive in the extreme. We have been prepared to support the Commonwealth police group's essentially monitoring and confidence building role, but I do not believe that foreigners in line positions would be effective in resolving what is a long running and intractable domestic Solomon Islands political dispute. Australia has been supporting and will continue to support in many ways the peace process now under way, assisting the Solomon Islands government with advice and material support, and those affected by the dispute. When being interviewed on an Australian radio program yesterday, the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Goff, speaking of course with the responsibility of government and not the cheap opportunism of opposition, had this to say - and I endorse what he had to say:No country outside of the Solomons can control the situation. We can simply try to influence it. In the old days they could use gunboat diplomacy . That doesn't apply today. If we were to send in troops or Australia was to send in troops, we may end up simply being the meat in the sandwich.Australia has acted correctly.  - We have acted with a care for the safety and the security of all Australian personnel who may be required to expose themselves to danger. I do not think Australians appreciate the attempt by the opposition to make cheap political capital out of this issue. Six months ago this government was being criticised in the wake of East Timor by the Leader of the Opposition, by the member for Kingsford-Smith and by others for being too, as they described it, triumphal and insensitive in the wake of the leadership that we had taken in relation to East Timor. Once more they were trying to walk both sides of the street. They said they supported the Timor deployment but they were prepared to make a bit of cheap political capital out of the inevitable strain that that deployment imposed on the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Once again the member for Denison, aided and abetted by the member for Kingsford-Smith, and no doubt capped by the Leader of the Opposition later on today in the matter of public importance, is doing the national interest in the eye. You know as well as I do that in a situation such as this, Mr Speaker, the injection of Australian police would have exposed them to an unacceptable physical danger. While I am Prime Minister of this country, I am not going to do that in relation to the police personnel of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for his question, and I take the opportunity of expressing to the people of Indonesia, and particularly the people of Sumatra, our sadness and concern at the severe earthquake that affected Sumatra which has already led to a very significant loss of life and very significant damage to property and disruption of power supplies and which has generally provoked an enormous amount of suffering and chaos in that part of Indonesia. We are concerned as a friendly neighbour to Indonesia that we should respond in whatever way we can. As an immediate step, I announce that Australia will provide half a million dollars aid for rapid response activities. We have already sent two Australian emergency experts, including an AusAID officer, to Sumatra to assess the need for further assistance. I indicate to the House that Australia is prepared to provide more funds and to provide more assistance once we know what is required and the way in which those resources can be most effectively deployed. We will be in discussion with the government of Indonesia regarding the situation so that the assistance that we are ready to give - and I know the provision of it will be widely supported in the parliament and the Australian community - can be most effectively deployed. I hope it might prove possible when I am in Tokyo later this week to personally discuss these matters with the President of Indonesia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for that very perceptive question he asked. It occurs against the background of howls of outrage from the Australia Labor Party, reverberating around the country, about the expenditure of government funds to provide information to the Australian public about the introduction of the new measure. It therefore struck me as very interesting when I was handed a pamphlet, which I understand is being paid for by the taxpayers of Queensland and being distributed to all the taxpayers of Queensland by the authority of the Queensland Labor government. I thought, `This cannot be so. It must have been one of those Commonwealth government programs in Queensland of which I was not informed.' But I discover on looking at the material that it says, `Further details can be obtained from the Office of State Revenue.' I can assure you that the Treasurer does not have an Office of State Revenue in Brisbane or in the state of Queensland.So what we have here is, once again, monumental Labor Party hypocrisy. It is perfectly all right for the Queensland government to advertise and claim as its own a First Home Owners Scheme which was always part of the design of taxation reform. But the difference between this document and our material is that our material is truthful and accurate and this is misleading. This is totally misleading, and it is really offensive. I have read a lot, but when you get a state government led by a Premier who knocked all other premiers out of the way in his enthusiasm to sign the GST deal -  - If ever I have seen -  - If ever I have seen a sunny Queensland face, it was the face of the Premier of Queensland the day he signed that agreement. And well it ought to have been. He is on the record as saying that Queensland has had a wonderful deal and that Queensland is very happy with the goods and services tax. And he knows, because that state will be the first of all of the states of Australia to benefit massively from the introduction of the goods and services tax. So this document is therefore a little rich, to say the least. Not only have they said it is a great idea and then hypocritically had a swipe at the federal government for the introduction of the GST; then they pretend to the people of Queensland that the First Home Owners Scheme was dreamt up by the Beattie government; that, if it had not been for the Beattie government, there would have been no First Home Owners Scheme. The first time a First Home Owners Scheme was developed in this country was in 1963 by the Menzies government. If there is one side of politics that ought to claim authorship of the First Home Owners Scheme and has been the great promoter of home ownership, it is the Liberal and National parties. To borrow a phrase of my colleague and friend the Treasurer: `Hypocrisy, thy name really is Labor, particularly Beattie Labor.'</DOC>

 - I think everyone should take for granted what the member for Hotham is talking about. On this occasion, we take for granted the fact that he chooses pink as his colour and that he chooses women's clothes when he goes shopping. The member for Hotham has proclivities in relation to this matter that we would rather not know about on this side of the House.That is all I will take for granted in relation to the member for Hotham's question, because the member for Hotham has conveniently overlooked the fact that the estimates put in the A New Tax System document originally were based on the full package that went to the people, as the Treasurer enunciated the other day, which the people of Australia voted for. That included the abolition of financial institutions duty on 1 July, the abolition of bank account debits tax on 1 July and a range of other initiatives which were not accepted by the Senate when the legislation went to the Senate. It is also the case that the estimates provided in that document were very different from the estimates and the methodology adopted by the ACCC. The ACCC's estimates are based on a six-month period after 1 July, which is a different pricing model from that adopted in the A New Tax System document.So, when the member for Hotham comes into this House and waves around women's clothing, you can only assume that there must be some motivation other than the best interests of the people of Australia. I say to the member for Hotham that, if he is going to make allegations and wave women's clothing around in this place, he had better have his facts right, he had better have his assertions right and he should go back and check the modelling. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I can advise the House that the introduction of Australia's new tax system will boost Australian economic growth. It will do that not only because it takes the unfair burden off goods and distributes it more productively over the whole economy but it boosts Australian exports by taking $4½ billion off the costs of Australian exports, it reduces investment and capital costs by taking imbedded costs off those and it allows Australian businesses to recover all taxes on business inputs.The proposition that the new tax system will boost growth in Australia is a proposition which is accepted by every state government, including every state Labor government. This is an important point. Under the intergovernmental agreement, the Commonwealth has agreed with the states that there will be a growth dividend arising from an economic boost from the new tax system. It is set out in a methodology paper which says that the growth dividend, expected to be two percentage points in the long run, will in the first year alone lead to increased state revenues under state taxes of $103 million. That is, the new tax system boosts the economy; because the economy is boosted, state taxes increase.This methodology paper has been agreed to by the Labor government of Tasmania, Premier Bacon and state Treasurer David Crean; it has been agreed to by the Labor government of New South Wales, Premier Carr and state Treasurer Egan; it has been agreed to by the Labor government of Queensland, Premier Beattie and state Treasurer Hamill. Every Labor government has agreed that there will be, at a minimum, a two per cent economic boost from the new tax system. Not only have they agreed on that; they have actually agreed to discount their payments by the bonus they get under state taxes from the increased growth.There is a truism in Australian politics and that is this: you never stand between a state Premier and a bucket load of money - never ever stand between a state Premier and a bucket load of money. So, if a state Premier has actually agreed to a discount because of the boost they are getting out of the new tax system, Mr Speaker, they have really agreed to it. A state Premier has never given away a dollar without the biggest fight that you have possibly seen. So there we have Dr David Crean, the Hon. Michael Egan and Mr Hamill all agreeing to a minimum two per cent economic boost from the new tax system. I am not aware of anybody who argues to the contrary, unless the federal Labor Party wants to argue to the contrary against all of its state governments.Given the fact that the Queensland government has signed an agreement recognising at least a two per cent economic boost, you can imagine my surprise to read in the Courier-Mail this morning, under the headline `Beattie backflip on jobs target', that the Queensland Premier says that he cannot meet his promise to reduce unemployment from eight per cent to five per cent because of the goods and services tax. He has agreed in writing that he gets an economic boost from the new tax system. They come down to Canberra, they sign up in writing to the fact that they get an economic boost, and they go home and say, `Oh, I can't meet my promises.' `Why?' `Because we're getting a boost to the economy.' He went out yesterday and he said that he couldn't meet his target because of the goods and services tax. He also said that he could not meet his target because of the Asian economic crisis - well, we will pay that, even though it was 1997 and 1998. He also said he could not meet it because of the dive in the value of the Australian dollar. I would like Matthew Franklin, the journalist who covered that, to ask Mr Beattie how, in an exporting state, a dive in the dollar is going to work against growth. It would be a very interesting proposition. We have here an unquestioned proposition that the new tax system will boost economic growth, which is agreed to by all of the Labor Party premiers and the state Treasurers. The Australian Labor Party apparently are against the price of clothing going up under the GST. Those opposite have to make only one pledge here today: that they will roll back the GST on clothing. I presume that was the import of the deputy leader's question. He had to make only one pledge. He is apparently against a GST on clothing - and so against it that, if he ever gets elected, he is going to keep it. That is his proposition. He is so against a GST on clothing, so concerned as to wave pink blouses in question time - a pink blouse to cover a pink heart from the ACTU president. He is so upset about it that he will not even give a pledge to repeal it. This is juvenile politics from the Labor Party and the opposition. They have one challenge today: if you are against a goods and services tax on clothing, pick up the blank sheet of paper and write down on the blank sheet of paper that, if you are ever elected, you will repeal it immediately.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. International students applying for study in Australia are coming in ever greater numbers. In the four months from December 1999 to March this year, more than 34,000 student visas were issued overseas to international students who want to study in Australia. This is a record figure and an 11 per cent increase on the figures from the same time last year. Indeed, last year overseas students at Australian universities increased by no less than 14 per cent, and this year we will see further very strong growth. Indeed, this follows growth of over 50 per cent over the last four years. So what we are seeing in the international student market is a very good recovery from the downturn of the Asian crisis. It is worth making the point that these students are additional to the Australian students for whom the government provides fully funded places. They do not take the places of Australian students. They are paying the full cost of the additional place that they occupy and making an additional revenue contribution to Australia's universities. In fact, these international students are contributing some $3 billion a year to the Australian economy, and we can expect this expenditure to grow over the coming years.  A survey of international students taken recently examined the reasons why students found Australia such a popular destination. The principal reason was the quality and the standing of university courses in Australia. Also, there is Australia's reputation as a safe and welcoming society, the fact that there are many things to do here, it is a technologically advanced nation, it is a modern, multicultural nation and, of course, it is a very affordable study destination. This year we are establishing the Australian Universities Quality Agency to further underpin the quality of international education in Australia.The final point I want to make is that, in this area, Australian universities have had very considerable flexibility. They have been able to put into place qualities that meet the needs of these overseas students. And what a contrast this is with the straitjacket that the National Tertiary Education Union, supported by the Labor Party, have been attempting to impose on Australian universities in relation to domestic students. It is time the Labor Party woke up to the fact that universities in this country are facing great challenges. They have great capacity to meet these challenges, provided those opposite rein in their dogs of the National Tertiary Education Union and allow the universities to make the enterprise agreements that will give them the flexibilities they need to be successful.</DOC>

 - I know that the member for Hotham just made a deliberate misrepresentation to the parliament. - In a letter from David Cousins -  - I am happy to withdraw and state that he very liberally misused the truth in this circumstance. I am in possession of a letter from the ACCC -  - It is very important that the House understand the background to the announcement by the WorkCover Authority last Friday. The first point to note is the political background to the assertion made by WorkCover. WorkCover is chaired by the Hon. Joe Reardon.   - Joe Reardon is a nice guy. Joe Reardon is not a bad guy. But he is the guy who puts his hand up whenever the Labor Party is throwing a hospital pass. He is the person who says -  - The current chair of the WorkCover Authority - a former minister in the Whitlam government, a former chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum just after Laurie Brereton opened up the third runway, and now he has been given the job of chair of the WorkCover Authority - came out with a statement on Friday claiming that they had the permission of the ACCC to increase prices all due, in the words of the member for Hotham, to the GST. That is totally incorrect. This political argument is closely linked with the fortunes of John Della Bosca, who also came out on Friday making misrepresentations about the impact of the GST on WorkCover. The fundamental point about this is that the WorkCover Authority in New South Wales has a black hole. Members on this side of the House are familiar with the history of the Labor Party with black holes. In this case there is a black hole of between $2 billion and $4 billion in the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales - $2 billion to $4 billion. So what a surprise that the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales should claim to increase prices as a result of the GST. Apart from a letter I previously mentioned that the ACCC had sent to the WorkCover Authority, I quote from a media release by the ACCC of last Friday. It states: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has not approved an increase in WorkCover NSW premiums by more than 10 per cent as a result of The New Tax System. 'The increase of 12.4 per cent announced by WorkCover NSW is due to other factors, as well as The New Tax System changes' ...And, for the benefit of the member for Hotham, it states:... Section 75AU(2)(c) relates to price changes caused by other factors such as suppliers' costs, supply and demand conditions and any other relevant matter ...  - If the member for Hotham has a problem with the provision of section 75AU of the Trade Practices Act, why didn't he say it during the debate in this House on that provision? Why didn't he say during the debate that he had a problem with suppliers' costs in section 75AU? It never came up because the member for Hotham is enjoying taking an opportunistic stand in relation to these matters long after the debate has been finalised in this House. I call on the member for Hotham to be honest with the Australian people. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I thank my fashion consultant over there; I have bigger problems than that. The member for Grey has had a particular interest in this area, and it has been particularly helpful to have his support on these issues. Over the past four years we have worked very hard to introduce programs that will be of particular help to rural Australians, and we have built on the success we have had over the past four years. We have introduced Medicare Easyclaim facilities, university departments for rural health - particularly in Whyalla in the member's own electorate - the Wagga Clinical School, John Flynn scholarships, the Rural Retention Program and regional health services. We have also introduced an increased rural surgical training program with a specific rural training scheme, and rural work force agencies that are state based. We have also set up a medical school at James Cook University in Townsville.We were able to build on these in the 2000 budget with a very comprehensive range of programs that had been thought out to try to address the gaps we found in what we had done through the previous four years of hard work. These initiatives include increasing the number of general practitioners and increasing the services that rural Australians can expect from health care. We are increasing the number of GPs through bonded scholarships that will tie the places into rural Australia - there are 100 a year - with the HECS debt to be worked off. We are increasing rural training - perhaps 50 per cent of all general practice training - and increasing specialist training positions. Divisions of general practice will be getting support for their GPs, there will be more allied health services and a doubling of the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme. Services are being improved by expanding the successful Regional Health Services Program - a lifeline for small non-government hospitals - and by a chronic disease strategy and initiatives to help older Australians.In contrast to this, over a period of five years the Labor Party have been able to announce only five ideas in the whole issue of rural health. In 1998, they announced they would support the James Cook University Medical School - this was much appreciated - and that occurred several months after the government announced it was going to do it. They announced a bonded scholarship scheme that had no mechanism to keep people in rural Australia - it would have been a complete flop and a waste of money: to a specialist who can earn $400,000 or $500,000 a year, a $20,000 a year bond is completely meaningless. They announced a $12 million expansion to the Rural Incentives Program, which would have been welcome. In 1996, they announced new places for specialist doctors that they dropped in 1998, and they also dropped in 1998 the medical vacancy training program. The net effect of what the government will have done over the same five-year period will be to increase funding from about $100 million to about $370 million per annum over the forward estimates period, compared with a real increase under Labor of about $12 million a year.The Labor Party have also announced recently something that would do significant damage to rural Australia. It is the worst example of tag-along, weak, selling out to an interest group politics that you could ever imagine. They are proposing to vote against an elimination of the sunset clause from the provider number legislation. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, what this would do. The first thing is that it would immediately put $248 million a year on to the costs of the federal government. You would have to find $248 million a year from somewhere. So do not think you can sneak around this; do not think you can make promises to the young doctors that you are not going to fund. You have to find $248 million every year, beginning in 2002, to pay for this weak capitulation. The second thing it will do is take 150 doctors straight out of rural Australia and destroy the Rural Locum Relief Program - one of the great successes that we have had in the last three years. So there is a cost to these cheap promises, there is a cost to this sell-out; and the cost will be borne by rural Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I am certainly pleased to inform her of the results of my consultations in relation to migration, particularly in regional Australia. I have had the opportunity of visiting her electorate to discuss these matters, and I have been to other parts of regional Australia where, in my consultations, there was a very significant concern expressed about the need to fill skilled vacancies. The government of course has recognised this and expanded the role of the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme.The scheme enables regional bodies to certify that there are shortages in specific skills in a region and allows local employers to sponsor suitably qualified staff from overseas to fill those positions. They are required to ensure that it does not deny employment opportunities to fellow Australians. It is in that context that I would like to inform the House and the honourable member that I have approved a further 16 regional certifying bodies under the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme. For New South Wales, there are 14 such regional certifying bodies. I might say to the honourable member that the Riverina Regional Development Board in her electorate is one such body certified for that purpose. There are 11 such bodies now in Victoria, and that means all of rural and regional Victoria and New South Wales have access to sponsorship bodies and are able, if there are job vacancies unable to be met within the local labour market, to assist employers in recruiting from overseas.The scheme is very positive for regional Australia and it is one that is working well: 89 per cent of employers using the scheme have indicated that they have been satisfied with it and would not hesitate to use it again. A review has suggested that 94 per cent of the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme visa employees have been satisfied with the employment opportunity that they have been able to take up in Australia. So it has obviously been a scheme that is having an impact on rural and regional Australia, one that is expanding job opportunities. When you fill those job opportunities in regional Australia, no doubt that flows through to ensuring that organisations are viable and can grow and provide other employment opportunities for members of the community. I urge members representing regional Australia to ensure that employers there are aware of the opportunities under this scheme and take advantage of it. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He has a number of indigenous tourism operators in his electorate, and in fact he was ably represented at a national indigenous tourism forum we held last weekend by Joe Ross of Bunuba Inc. at Fitzroy Crossing in his electorate. That forum was an excellent example of the government, in partnership with industry, ensuring that indigenous businesses enjoy and partake of the strong growth in Australia's tourism industry.In the decade out from the Olympic Games we expect a doubling of international visitors to Australia, and with that will come tens of thousands of new jobs and earnings in excess of $30 billion per annum. Research shows that there is a significant, growing international interest in an authentic indigenous tourism experience. Up to 80 per cent of European visitors and a significant proportion of those from other destinations seek an indigenous experience. The key issue at last weekend's forum was to satisfy that consumer demand for a high quality, authentic indigenous experience in a culturally sensitive manner.Prime Minister, I am happy to report that the forum brought together around 200 regional, rural, remote and city based indigenous tourism operators, including a number of leading mainstream operators and employers and potential investors, very much focused on practical outcomes. One of those key practical outcomes was the commitment by one of Australia's largest hotel groups, Accor, to create 100 jobs for indigenous people in its hotels right across Australia. Another outcome was the development of a financial management package by Aboriginal Tourism Australia in partnership with government and industry. That will provide a blueprint for indigenous businesses starting up in private enterprise.We also had commitments coming forward from key tourism industry associations, such as the TCA and ITOA, to facilitate access by indigenous tourism operators to the services provided by those organisations. The Australian Tourist Commission also made a commitment to double the number of indigenous tourism business participants at its annual Australian Tourism Exchange, which is the largest Australian tourism trade show. It is also underwriting millions and millions of dollars of business annually. By providing access to economic empowerment, we make a real contribution towards practical reconciliation.I would like to take this opportunity to thank a few of the industry people involved in that summit. They are Mr David Baffsky from Accor; Peter Johnson from Chubb Training Services; Paul Ah Chee from the Aboriginal Art and Culture Centre in Alice Springs; Joe Ross, as I mentioned, from the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate; Phil Young from the TCA; Peter Shelley from ITOA; and Lois Peeler from Aboriginal Tourism Australia. They all worked together to make the forum quite a resounding success.</DOC>

 - Was that the member for Kingsford-Smith saying that? Mr Speaker, I do not accept the assertions made by the member. He is comparing apples with oranges, as I have already pointed out, in relation to the modelling behind the figures. But what we have seen today is the opposition engaging in price monitoring. Do you know what? On this side of the House we welcome price monitoring. On this side of the House we welcome consumers being the best guard of prices during the transition to the A New Tax System. On this side of the House we believe in price monitoring during the transition to the A New Tax System. I ask the Labor Party: where was the price monitoring regime when they jacked up wholesale sales tax from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, from 20 per cent to 22 per cent and from 30 per cent to 32 per cent? Where was the compensation for families when the Labor Party were jacking up taxes? Who was protecting consumers? Who was protecting pensioners? Who was protecting families? The Labor Party weren't.  - We put in place a price monitoring regime that the Labor Party never even dreamed about - three million prices are being monitored; $56 million to the ACCC over the next three years. We are about one sole motivation - that is, protecting consumers. So when the member stands up in this House and asks a question about insurance and conveniently forgets that the original estimates differ from the latest estimates in that we have not been able, through the fault of the Labor Party, to deliver on time the abolition of financial institutions duty and the abolition of bank account debits tax - the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares we have actually put in place on time, despite the Labor Party - and asserts that apples can be compared with oranges, I say only this: the Labor Party will be judged not on their words but on their actions. Not on a single occasion have the Labor Party come into this House seeking to protect consumers. Not once. And not on one occasion did the Labor Party, whenever they were in government, put in place a price monitoring regime that protected Australian pensioners, that protected Australian families and that protected Australian consumers. We will look at each of the allegations made by the Labor Party, and we will come back with facts and not fiction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question because this government is doing a great deal in this area. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has always administered benefits according to veteran's service eligibility. We have never asked veterans to reveal their ethnicity or their cultural heritage. However, this government is making a concerted effort to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans are getting the pensions and other benefits to which veterans are entitled. My department is conducting a nationwide campaign to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans and their families are aware of veteran benefits and services and also at the same time my department is encouraging veterans to contact them to discuss their eligibility. Furthermore, staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs have received cross-cultural training. Additionally, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veteran project officers are available in every state office to provide a culturally sensitive service to indigenous veterans. We have also supported the formation of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans services association. My department is working with this association to promote the interests of indigenous veterans. We have recently provided a grant of some $87,800 to help that association identify and assist indigenous veterans and their dependants.Whilst I am here I would also like to take this opportunity to advise the House that last week the office building which houses the national office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and also the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was renamed in honour of the Lovett family, a Victorian Aboriginal family. I believe that was a fitting tribute to the members of that family because, since World War I right throughout this century and right up to the deployment in East Timor, 19 members of that family have served. I think the renaming of that building in that family's honour is a fitting tribute to that family, as it is indeed to all indigenous Australians who served our nation. I thank the member for his question. </DOC>

 - Yet again, I do not accept the assertions made by the honourable member. Yet again, the honourable member is comparing apples with oranges. He is comparing the basis upon which the original estimates were made - the original package which the Labor Party would not support that included the changes to those indirect taxes, the indirect taxes which the Labor Party opposed abolishing - to the latest package. I call on the member for Port Adelaide and also the member for Lyons to tell me the names of the companies that are doing this. Give us the names of the companies, and we will investigate. But we want to know exactly who you are alleging is engaging in this sort of activity. - Again, I assert that, if the opposition are going to make baseless claims about individual companies, we want to know the names of those companies. We on this side of the House are all engaged in price monitoring, and when it comes to various other allegations -  - As I said, the member for Lyons was comparing apples with oranges in the assertions he made, and I invite the member for Port Adelaide and other members on both sides of the House, if they believe that an individual company is engaging in price exploitation, to provide names to us. Otherwise, the answer is apples and oranges. You know - apples, oranges?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley. I think all members of the House - particularly the Victorians and, I suspect, privately the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks - will be very concerned to hear today that the Democrats have rejected outright any proposal to deal with the threat of Campaign 2000. -  - This is a threat which I believe all members of the House should be concerned about. The government raised this issue and proposals to deal with it prior to Christmas, and those proposals did not meet with any support from the Democrats. We met again with the Democrats at the end of January and in early February. On 16 February, they gave us a second version. They gave us a proposal on pattern bargaining. So that was the second time we had a set of proposals. - On 16 February. - We further refined these proposals in discussions with the Democrats. In April, I further met with the Democrats, including Senator Lees, and I understood that, whilst we were continuing discussions on the technicalities of the bill, their position was that they believed it was a threat which ought to be dealt with by further legislation. As we have seen in the last couple of days, the Senate committee has brought down its report. We met with the Democrats last night. We took their report as a starting point and put a series of propositions to them overnight. We gave them those propositions -  - I would have to say that they were minimalist propositions, which we put to them again this morning, and in their meeting this morning they have rejected each and every one of those proposals, including those which built on the very minority report that they brought down yesterday.We are still very concerned about what is going to happen. We have people like Craig Johnston in Victoria, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who boast about the fact that they can break the law, ruin companies, lose jobs and lose investment. The Leader of the Opposition is publicly standing shoulder to shoulder with Craig Johnston, Dean Mighell and those who are determined to bring down the system of enterprise bargaining and to take this country back to a system which lost us thousands and thousands of jobs in the 1970s. Every day lost due to strikes in Campaign 2000 will be the responsibility of the weak Leader of the Opposition. Every job lost in the state of Victoria will be the responsibility of the Leader of the Opposition. Every dollar of investment lost in both Victoria and this country in the times ahead as a result of the return of pattern bargaining and industry-wide strikes will be the political responsibility of the Leader of the Opposition. When you have weak leadership that capitulates to the unions, the people who suffer are the very workers that the Labor Party -  - In the last week or so, we have seen the Labor Party abandon a policy that they themselves stood for in 1998. They would not lift a finger for the workers at Scone in their hour of need, they would not call upon Bob Carr to provide some financial support to the blokes up at Scone who genuinely needed support; and, in the face of a campaign by their union mates to break the law and cost jobs in Victoria, the Leader of the Opposition sits there mute, unable to stand up for the national interest. It is a sad day when this legislation is rejected, but the political responsibility ultimately lies with the Leader of the Opposition, and I can assure him that he will not forget this day and his betrayal of the workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector in Victoria. </DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that I did. As to the advice provided by the Victorian legal sources, that material is being examined by the appropriate authorities. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the press statement made by Mr Becker last night which deals point by point with the issues. It makes it quite clear that the AEC sought legal advice before providing the electoral information. I was, at all material times, advised that the course of action being undertaken by the government was proper and correct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. The House would be aware of developments overnight in the Solomon Islands. I want to say that I cautiously - and I use the word `cautiously' very deliberately - welcome the agreement that appears to have been reached last night between the Solomon Islands foreign minister and Mr Nori from the Malaitan Eagle Force which provides for parliament to reconvene on 15 June to settle the issue of the prime ministership and for the Prime Minister to be released from house arrest and to be free to move around. I use the word `cautiously' very deliberately because we will have to wait and see how this agreement is implemented in practice. It is not clear that Mr Nori speaks for all Malaitans, and it will also depend upon whether Malaitan and Guadalcanal militant groups now stop fighting, lay down their arms and permit a constitutional process to occur. In fact, there have been further reports this morning of clashes between different groups within the Solomon Islands. We will be, of course, following all of these developments very closely.Let me say to the House that the government remains very critical of the resort to force and arms which has been involved in the detention - even though it is now to be apparently ended - of the lawful and constitutionally installed Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands. That remains an unacceptable act; although, in a proper sense of realism, if the end result is a return to constitutional and democratic government, it would clearly be in the interests of all that that particular phase of developments be welcomed.What may be unfolding in the Solomon Islands underscores a point I made in the parliament yesterday - that is, ultimately these matters had to be resolved within the Solomon Islands without the introduction of outside influences, particularly in circumstances where one had no clear view as to how that outside intervention might be ended. I note the fact that the Commonwealth ministerial advisory group meeting in London discussed the Solomon Islands situation. It expressed its concern at developments and has agreed to send a ministerial mission of Australia, Botswana and Malaysia to the Solomon Islands to convey this concern. That particular group will also be going to Fiji.I say again to those who argued - and I heard the argument coming from the other side - that we should have been responding to a request to install Australian police in line areas of responsibility that, in my view, that is a flawed and hasty analysis of this situation. Ultimately, no responsible government is a party to introducing Australian police or Australian Defence personnel into any overseas situation unless that government is completely satisfied as to the positive benefit of that action on the domestic situation and unless it is completely satisfied that the risks to the lives and safety of the personnel are the minimum that the circumstances will allow. Those circumstances did not exist in relation to the request that we received. The fact that the government receives a letter from the honourable member for Denison telling it that it ought to introduce Australian police is not, of itself, a reason why the government should act. Our position all along - and it was conveyed very strongly to the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands - was that the matter should be resolved by the people of the Solomon Islands. I hope that the indications coming out of the country today are that that is going to occur. If it does occur, the proper approach of the government will have been fully vindicated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. There certainly is a threat. In fact the metals unions in Victoria have been running a campaign and making preparations. They have something like 1,000 or more companies now signed up in Victoria. What that heralds is the possibility of industry wide strikes. I saw in the Sydney Morning Herald only yesterday that the CFMEU state secretary, Andrew Ferguson - brother to two members in this place - referred to the industry wide action in the building industry on Monday in Sydney as `magnificent' with virtually every building site closed in Victoria. This is the Fergusons' idea of a good day - closing down a whole industry, threatening jobs and discouraging investment in their own home state. I should not single those two out because that is the view of the frontbench on the other side. The Labor Party in government never supported the right to strike across an industry, yet we have a weak Leader of the Opposition and what does he do? The unions ask for it and he gives it, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the jobs that would be lost. As the Australian industry group has said, we now run the real risk that unions will misuse the protected action provisions as part of their campaign to end enterprise bargaining. This is a clear manipulation of the protected bargaining provisions. - The Labor Party put the provisions in. - I am happy to have such an interjection. It reminds people -  - Well, let me respond to the question and make a general remark. The Labor Party in government supported a right to industrial action at the single enterprise level but legislated against multi-employer industrial action. They were opposed to it. They legislated against it. Yet now in opposition the Leader of the Opposition cannot even stand up for the policy which Labor had while they were in government. As ACCI have said, `It is clear that the path to economic growth, with increased productivity and competitiveness, should have a labour relations system focused firmly on the needs of individual enterprises.' That is a very sensible comment that could have been made by any Labor leader until the weak Labor leader we have today. Lastly, there are things that people can do in the event of this industrial action. The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, reinserted by this government, do provide people with a real remedy. For employers, no employer is compelled to abide by the demands of the AMWU and its demands for uniform wages and conditions. Any employer who pays an employee who goes on strike may be pursued by the Office of the Employment Advocate. For employees, for workers, no worker is compelled by law to go on strike if they do not want to. This government will support the right of the employees and workers who do not want to be pushed into industrial action by the union thuggery supported by the Labor Party. Unions who force an employee to go on strike can be pursued by the Office of the Employment Advocate, an advocate which the Labor Party proposes to abolish but which does give workers protection against such coercion. Sadly, this campaign is now in the hands of union militants in Victoria, and, sadly, they are today cock-a-hoop because their efforts in organising and manipulating a campaign against workers' interests will have - and does have today - the sanction of and is condoned by the Leader of the Opposition. It is a disgrace that the Leader of the Opposition cannot stand up to protect workers in Victoria. </DOC>

 - I think the first point that the House should recognise is that the member for Lilley is always wrong, and he is wrong today. It is important to recognise that at least we have a package in place to compensate pensioners for price increases - that is why they are getting an increase of four per cent. We are assisting older Australians particularly by reducing the taper rate from 60c and increasing the assets test. We have this bonus plan in place now, which the Australian Labor Party never did when they increased their wholesale sales taxes, and nor did they ever bring forward their tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I assure the member for Hinkler that the reform of Australia's workplace relations system must continue and will continue. This government is very committed to that process. There are some compelling reasons why that must be the case. The first and obvious reason is that the reform process that we have so far introduced has produced real benefits to workers. Workers today have higher wages, they are better off and there are more jobs. Those clearly are reasons to continue.The second thing is that this government knows - as Tony Blair in the UK knows - that the modern workplace is changing and that attitudes to work are changing. Individuals today in the workplace do not want to be treated as grey figures, all of whom are exactly the same. It is a trait in modern society that people are better educated and better informed. They have higher living standards and want to have a greater say on the way in which they work. They want to have a greater say in when they work, how they work and the conditions in which they work. That simply means that the whole system has to keep up with the reality of what is happening in modern workplaces. Sure, it might not be happening in every workplace, but in modern, progressive workplaces this is the way of the future, and we have to have an industrial relations system that allows that. And thirdly - and reflecting that second point - increasingly in workplaces, workers realise that the future is not having a class warfare with the boss and a them and us mentality. That is why, in so many workplaces, employers and employees are trying to do deals and come to arrangements which suit both parties, and that means higher wages for employees and more efficient businesses for employers.The system has to deal with the reality. Of those sitting on the Labor side in the Senate, 70 per cent or 69 per cent might be former trade union leaders or officials, but out in the real world only one in five workers in the private sector is in unions. You just cannot say, at the 1998 election - as the Labor Party did - that you are in favour of individual agreements and now be opposed to them. In the real world, 6,000 AWAs were filed last month. There is obviously a growing demand for that system within average workplaces. Also, more and more people are interested in being involved as shareholders in the business in which they work.I think one of the proudest achievements of this government has been to encourage share ownership, but we want to encourage not only the public to have shares but employees in businesses to have shares so you can align the interests of workers and business. I am delighted that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations will, in the next month or so, hopefully be reporting on employee share ownership, which I referred to the committee. This reflects that, in a modern Australia, more and more workers want to take up this option. In conclusion, you cannot look back to the 1970s for our workplace relations system. You have to look to the turn of the century and into the next century to have a system that suits ordinary workers, not a system which suits union bosses who run the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that the member for Lilley is showing so much compassion to pensioners - because, if the Australian Labor Party were still in government, pensioners would have lost out, before the efforts that we have made in compensation measures. - Thank you. I am glad the Australian Labor Party is showing some patience. Before I get to the point, it is interesting to note that Australian pensioners would have lost out by $13 per fortnight if the Labor Party had continued to index pensions on the CPI alone. It was this government, through the MTAWE, that actually increased pensions by $13. What we are doing now, with the new tax system coming into place -  - You never did it. You only did it twice, the member for Hotham - and that was once before the 1990 election and once before the 1993 election, and for purely political purposes.  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course the government is introducing a bonus scheme, because we are recognising that with the increase in inflation through the CPI pensioners should be compensated. They were never compensated in the past when there were increases in inflation. Of course, the $1,000 is the maximum amount they can obtain through the saving bonuses: if they choose to invest that and earn revenue from it, then it may well affect their pension. If they choose to spend it, it will not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The reality is that Labor's stance on pattern bargaining reflects, again, the blatant flexing of ACTU muscle and the immediate capitulation by those on the front bench opposite. The unions ask for it, and the ALP frontbench gives it to them. Their latest collapse will be deplored across rural and regional Australia. It will be deplored, because they know what it means. It means that yet again there is an open invitation to militant unions like the Meatworkers Union, with a long and inglorious history of militancy. I hear them groan opposite, and well they might: we all remember that in this place once upon a time, for a short period only, they got realistic about this industry, and their spokesman, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Cook, in 1992 said, `We ought to get rid of the tally system.' He was not able to -  - No, he did not last long. That has been left to the current minister, who has really instituted some decent reform in this area. Peter Cook was not able to deliver. Do you know why not? The ACTU said no. Peter Cook said, `This will produce more jobs. This will save jobs and produce more jobs. It is an important reform.' But the ACTU said no. And who headed up the ACTU in those days? He sits over there now, on the front bench. In this place in those days, the ALP could see that industrial relations reform was needed for jobs, but the ACTU could not. Who pulled the strings? The ACTU did. So the capacity now for unions to flex their muscles by bringing entire industries to a halt across the nation will not be welcomed in the regions. It will mean that again we have the spectre of country businesses being loaded with additional costs that big city unions screw out of big companies - costs that country businesses do not need and cannot afford.If there is a dispute in the city, we see the real prospect again of pattern bargaining meaning that country businesses grind to a halt as well. The potential to cripple vital export industries and damage jobs out there is the last thing that we need in rural and regional Australia at the moment. We have been looking for, and this government has been delivering, more flexibility and more productivity in regional and rural work forces, and that has in many instances been underpinning a substantial increase in the number of jobs and opportunities in areas like northern Victoria, where the dairy industry in its value adding has made real progress.I remember when I came into this place a group in my own electorate approaching me about a joint venture to set up a cotton spinning plant with some Asians. The Asians backed out. You know why? Because Australian interest rates were too high, and they said, `With your industrial relations record we will never get the flexibility we need to make the plant pay for itself.'  - It is a different story now. You want to go back to the dark days. The most amazing thing about this is that it is a total failure in leadership, not just from the Leader of the Opposition but from his frontbench team as well - the union dream team that stands behind him. We have got the member for Hotham and the member for Batman there, both former heads of the ACTU. The Leader of the Opposition recently said that his strategy for winning back the bush was to send out those two people who are so loved in the bush, the member for Batman and the member for Hotham. So these two friends of the farmer are going to go out there and win the argument. - Yes, absolutely - 23 per cent interest rates. We saw the disdain that they showed for the real interests of country workers when they were in power. I cannot help myself making this observation out of sympathy for the member for Batman and the member for Hotham: it really must be quite difficult to make the transition from puppeteer to puppet.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. He would be aware that over a long period of time states have operated schemes designed to encourage the consumption of low alcohol beer as opposed to high alcohol beer for public health reasons; for example, to cut the road toll, to encourage health and to cut down on the dangers of excessive alcohol drinking.When the High Court struck down state business franchise fees in 1997 in the case of Haha and Lim against New South Wales, at the request of the states the Commonwealth reimposed those state taxes so that the state budgets would be protected. We did it on one condition; we did it on the condition that if we stepped into the breach and picked up the revenue which had been declared unconstitutional for and on behalf of the states the states would continue their subsidy schemes, including the subsidy scheme which made low alcohol beer cheaper than higher alcohol beer. The way in which the Commonwealth stepped in was with its wholesale sales tax, called a `revenue replacement'. It paid the money to the states on the condition that the states kept paying those subsidies. With the advent of tax reform, the Commonwealth is still paying to the states those revenue replacements; still paying the money from which the states are to continue those state subsidies. They still have that money and, from the Commonwealth's point of view, they still are obliged to pay those subsidies.In one of the sneakier moves that I have seen by a state government recently, led by the Labor Party in New South Wales, the New South Wales government is now proposing to take the money that funds the subsidy and to wipe out the subsidy, that is, to try to make heavy alcohol beer more cost-effective against low alcohol beer, to try to undermine public health in the state of New South Wales and to try to make a profit out of the funding arrangements. The government of the ACT obviously has been forced to follow because it could not run a subsidy within the ACT where you could buy subsidised low alcohol beer on one side of the territory line but not on the other. The only other government in Australia which, I regret to say, has engaged in this sneaky little arrangement is the Labor government of Tasmania under the Treasurership of Dr David Crean. I am pleased to inform the House that Premier Bracks is above a sneaky trick like that, and that the Labor Premier of Victoria is continuing the subsidy arrangements. I am pleased to inform the House that the Liberal Premier of Western Australia is continuing the subsidy arrangements. I am pleased to inform the House that the Liberal Premier of South Australia is continuing those arrangements. This is a sneaky trick out of New South Wales, copycatted by the Labor government of Tasmania: an attempt to take a financial windfall at the expense of public health; an attempt to put people at risk on the roads and in relation to their health - to take the money for the subsidy and to pocket it and to put public health at risk. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned we will not allow the sneaky Labor governments of New South Wales and Tasmania to get away with this particular little trick. They are being paid to continue those subsidies. The Commonwealth demands that they continue those subsidies. We will not continue to fund them to pay subsidies which they do not pass on to consumers.I noticed the Labor Deputy Leader of the Opposition regards this with great mirth - the prospect of taking money out of low alcohol consumers and pocketing it - no doubt influenced by the wayward example that is given to him out of the Tasmanian Labor government. If he had any decency, if he had any guts, if he were prepared to take a stand for public health, he would be condemning the New South Wales and Tasmanian Labor governments; he would be nailing himself to the example of Premier Bracks, Premier Olsen and Premier Court. It is another example where the federal Labor Party ought to speak up and ought to condemn this retrograde behaviour.</DOC>

 - There are a number of points that the member raises. The first point is about the money the government is spending on advertising. It should be remembered that all of the GST revenue that is coming back, $24 billion, actually goes to the states and territories - back to your schools, back to your hospitals. It goes back to the states. As far as the bonus is concerned, at least we are providing two bonuses, a savings bonus and a supplementary bonus. - If she is earning the income and she is pushed over the limit, then she is not entitled to part of it. But the point is that we are providing $1,000 maximum to pensioners and $2,000 maximum to people over the age of 55 if they qualify. The other inference that you make is on Centrelink and on the erroneous information that they are providing to your constituent, and I think that is very unfair. It is about time the Australian Labor Party in this parliament stops running down that organisation, which is providing valuable government information, providing information on the new tax system which is going to reform this economy. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. Last week I reminded the House that the government has made available some $259 million over three years to universities under the Workplace Reform Program. This money is designed to fund salary increases for staff at universities that commit themselves to the implementation of genuine workplace reform. The additional flexibility that these universities will get through these reforms will enable them to meet the increasing challenges of competition, both here and abroad.The government's intentions here are completely at odds with those coming from the other side of the House and their mates in the National Tertiary Education Union. How do we know this? The National Tertiary Education Union enterprise bargaining manual tells us exactly what the union and the Labor Party are about. This document tells their negotiators that they should avoid and attempt to ban AWAs and to stop pay rises contingent on the performance of their universities. It introduces an exorbitant salary claim of 19 per cent over three years. It vetoes contracting out, casualisation - anything that could be said to be increased workload. And one for the member for Dobell: no weekend work unless agreed by the union. That would be very attractive to him.There is more. There is a minimum of 20 weeks away-from-class contact in addition to annual leave and public holidays. That is the sort of commitment that I suspect would be welcomed only by the member for Dickson - 20 weeks away. That the union should attempt to impose this sort of condition on Australian universities is absolutely unacceptable. It gets worse: the document vetoes any local agreements from being entered into by requiring the national headquarters of the union to sign off on each agreement. We recently saw a local agreement at the University of Southern Queensland thrown out on this basis. At the very time when Australian universities need increased flexibility to better meet the needs of students and secure the opportunities for their staff, we find the NTEU want ever tighter rigidities, and the Labor Party is backing them to the hilt. At the last national conference the then shadow spokesman for education said:I look forward to working closely with the leadership of the two unions, the Australian Education Union and the National Tertiary Education Union, to turn the contents of this chapter into the programs and policies of a Beazley Labor government.We have seen, within the last 48 hours, the Labor Party and the Democrats, under union pressure, opposing legislation which will protect universities against nationwide strikes on every campus. The Leader of the Opposition wants the option of nationwide strikes by the union against the universities to be an available option for the National Tertiary Education Union. It is clear that the unions are running this weak Leader of the Opposition and that the Labor Party has capitulated to the union movement. This is to the grave disadvantage of the security of Australian academics, of the flexibility and competitiveness of Australian universities and of the services that are provided to students on university campuses.</DOC>

 - The first premise is wrong as far as inflation forecasts are concerned. Our budget forecasts are for 4.5 per cent for the September 2000 quarter, of which 3.75 per cent will be in relation to the GST. That is why we are bringing forward the two per cent, to bring it to four per cent, in payments whether for pensioners or for youth allowance. This government has done more for people on youth allowance than you ever did for people on Austudy because, for the first time, people receiving youth allowance can actually get rental assistance. Also, by making youth allowance available to people in rural areas, another 7,000 people can access youth allowance so that they can go away to education and study. The main point is that when those people finish their studies - their education - they are going to be in a much better position to get employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, acknowledge his very real interest in it and thank him for his input, based on an extensive understanding of the industry and the somewhat pointed nature of the dispute, inasmuch as the trucking blockades and so forth have affected people in his electorate. Last week I informed this House of the disruption on our national highways caused by those road blockages, which were organised by owner-driver transport operators seeking to draw public attention to the difficulties that they are facing at the moment. As I said at that time in this place and elsewhere, I certainly have some sympathy for them in their current plight. I recently wrote a letter to the owner-drivers, and I am pleased to say that they have now determined that they will work with the government.The member for New England, reflecting his enormous background in this area, Senator Ron Boswell, as my parliamentary secretary in this area, and I had a very constructive meeting last night with long distance truck drivers, the Australian Trucking Association and representatives of the TWU. At this meeting we agreed that a positive way forward was to work to develop an industry code of practice. It is envisaged that this code would, amongst other things, deal with business relationships, including payment periods, with prime contractors, freight forwarders and others. It would also look at safety and technical matters. It is proposed that the code be developed by the industry. I have indicated that I will, through my department, provide assistance to progress its development and facilitate meetings with other sectors of the industry, as well as users of the services, to ensure that there is a shared endorsement of the plan. A clear outcome of the meeting was that there will be no return to the blockades that were being conducted up until a few days ago. I reiterate that it was made plain there last night that the government will not be legislating to set freight rates or to license the industry. I am pleased to say, too, that at last night's meeting the owner-drivers held a telephone hook-up which supported the outcomes of the meeting. It is an example of how cooperation and the sensible working through of issues can produce better outcomes for everyone.</DOC>

 - Again, you can never rely on the Australian Labor Party to tell the truth. The response back from my department was that they expected 150,000 inquiries, not 150,000 people claiming it, which is totally wrong. You have misled the House, quite frankly - And you ought to apologise. The point is that the government does recognise this. That is why we have set up provisions within the Family Assistance Office. If we think some people in the interim transition period -  - I think the important point this House should recognise is that the member gave incorrect information. The important point is that the taper rates for pensioners will be reduced and the income test will be eased - indeed the income and assets test-free areas are going to be raised by 2½ per cent. The important point for pensioners and families is that, if there is an interim period, we have made provisions for it within the Family Assistance Office, provisions that were never made by the Australian Labor Party when you increased your wholesale sales taxes. The Chief Opposition Whip knows that. He knows it better than anyone. They were never put in place. You failed to deliver on your tax cuts, and that is why the government have put forward transitionary measures as well as the extra $2.4 billion in assistance going to Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and his interest in this area. A doctor in a country town is a very visible sign for a rural community of the health and viability of that community and, as the rural population ages, it becomes more of an issue. We have had some success in the last three years. From mid-1996 to mid-1999, the number of doctors in country Australia, including specialists and GPs, has gone from about 7,400 to 8,200 - an increase of 11 per cent. Admittedly, the full-time equivalent is not as high, but that reflects a much greater provision of locum relief, which is a very positive thing. But more needs to be done, and in the budget we had specific measures aimed at this. We want to make it as easy as possible for someone to go to the country once they have trained in medicine. We also want to get more country kids into medicine. This is important because, as far as I can see, over 30 years we have progressively excluded country kids from med school. There was no quota in medicine until about 1956, when the University of Melbourne introduced one, and until then you could matriculate with four Ds and get into med school. Many more country kids did so in that period. By 1966 you needed three As, by 1976 you needed four As and by 1986 you needed five As; and the number of country kids dropped off.In order to reverse this, we are doing a number of things with short-, medium- and long-term effects. In the short term, from next year people will be able to work off their HECS debts by going to country locations. We will regionalise the training program for general practice starting from next year, and this should have immediate benefits. In the medium term, we are going to increase the number of rural GP training positions, and the number of RAMUS scheme scholarships will be doubled from 200 to 400 next year. In the long term, we will have additional places in medical schools for doctors wishing to make a commitment to rural areas. When the system is fully operating, we will have 100 additional doctors each and every year going into country Australia. There has been much comment on these proposals, but the comment I would like to particularly single out is a press release from the member for Jagajaga. Under the headline `Rural Health Needs Results Not More Promises', she makes the following statement:Recently a significant number of short term overseas doctors have moved in to relieve the crisis. However the secret Rural Stocktake written by Dr Jack Best has reportedly found that only 34 fully trained Australian doctors have been registered in rural areas out of the 1200 who have completed their postgraduate GP training in the last three years.I will give the member for Jagajaga a bit of friendly advice: it is never wise to comment on a report you have not read. While the report is not supposed to be secret - we will be releasing it in about two weeks - I make the comment that this number relates to people who graduated from general practice training in early 1997 and early 1998, and the people graduating from general practice training are absolutely the same people who were selected into general practice training in the first place. If there has been a dismal failure, as the honourable member suggests, the dismal failure concerns the type of people we selected in the general practice training program to graduate.I think honourable members will be interested if I ask: when were the people graduating in early 1997 and 1998 selected into the training program? There is one year of specialist rural training, two years of GP training and one year of postgraduate training, so these people would have graduated from medicine in early 1993 or 1994 but would have been selected to go into the program around September 1992 or September 1993. So this dismal failure in fact relates to the period when the former member for Batman, Brian Howe, was the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. I do not blame Brian Howe because this is a difficult, technical and complex area. The person who should take the blame is the person who was advising him at the time. And who was the person advising Brian Howe at the time we had this dismal failure? It was the current member for Jagajaga. So, in trying to criticise the government, she is herself admitting that Labor let down rural people by their dismal failure in rural health. They have, and we are putting in the long-term solutions to fix it.</DOC>

 - I feel honoured that the Leader of the Opposition has given me a question. It is important to recognise again that the opposition's assertion that 150,000 families will be worse off under the GST is absolutely incorrect. To reiterate: our family assistance payments will be increased, the taper rates will be reduced, the income tests will be eased, the assets tests will be abolished, there will be an extra $2.4 billion in family assistance and there will be very large tax cuts. It could be John and Wendy or it could be Kim and Cheryl, but the important point to recognise is that the government have put into account transitional measures. The government are very cognisant of this, and the government will be making further announcements later today. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate it greatly. Yesterday in the House, the opposition asked a question in relation to Home Ideas magazine. They said:Home Ideas magazine this month carries a dual tag which shows a GST-inclusive price that will be 10.18 per cent higher after 1 July - a GST price increase greater than 10 per cent.At the time, I said that I would refer it to the ACCC, and I have. I have received some information back. The information I have received from Express Publications, the publisher of Home Ideas magazine, is as follows. Home Ideas magazine has been around for some time. I have here a number of previous issues - and I remind the House that yesterday the member for Wills said that the price after 1 July is going up to $5.95. The Home Ideas bumper issue was previously priced at $5.95. The Home Ideas `Renovating Do's and Don'ts' issue was priced at $5.95. The Home Ideas `Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Makeovers' issue was priced at $5.95. The ACCC has received a letter from Express Publications saying:As per our discussions, I attach copies of Home Ideas that were on sale prior to the introduction of the GST. You will note that each issue carries a pre-GST cover price of $5.95. The management of Express Lifestyle Publications have taken the decision to absorb the impact of the GST on 'Beautiful Home Ideas No. 2.' As a result, our net dollar margin on this title will actually suffer once the GST takes effect on 1 July 2000.What does that say? It says that you cannot trust what the Labor Party says in this House. You cannot believe the Labor Party's assertions, because it is getting it wrong. Keep feeding it up. - I table the letter from Express Publications and the front pages of the magazines with pleasure.</DOC>

 - I am happy to give the member for Deakin more good news from the Howard government. Australian job seekers can now click on to some of the most advanced employment services in the world, thanks to outstanding work from officers of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The Australian Job Search web site run by my department was completely revamped on 30 March, and it now offers employers the chance to directly lodge vacancies online, it offers job seekers the chance to directly lodge resumes online, and it gives businesses the ability to find the right person for the right job online through a virtual labour exchange. And all these services are absolutely and completely free. With 120,000 hits per day, the Australian Job Search web site is by far the most visited employment web site in Australia and it is amongst the top 10 Australian web sites generally. Another recent innovation was the launch of Job Outlook which provides detailed online information on employment prospects, qualifications required and salaries for more than 400 different occupations. I have been asked about international evidence. I am pleased to say that, following Australia's lead, the UK government has introduced its own site, Skillsbase, which is a less comprehensive version of Job Outlook. Last year the British House of Commons published a report which described the Job Network as:... a unique step which is being watched closely by employment ministers around the world.The UK House of Commons report said:We learned a great deal from what we saw in Australia and we believe that the innovative approach of many of the policies we examined may yet inform future developments in the UK. We will be watching the progress of the Job Network ... closely over the coming months.While the United Kingdom government is watching and learning from us, the shadow minister for employment is watching and learning from them - although I suppose I should at least congratulate the member for Dickson for finally overcoming her previously reported aversion to travel. The shadow minister should now be only too well aware that when it comes to the study of employment services there is absolutely no place like home. So I say to the shadow minister: stick with us, study the Job Network, visit a few Work for the Dole providers, and you will be amazed at what you learn.</DOC>

 - The government announced yesterday that there has been an extension of the three months by nine months - making a total of 12 months - to ensure that, if there are adjustments that need to be made in that transition period for people who have been receiving payments through the new family tax benefit part B, there is this window of 12 months which we have provided. It is important because we believe that families should certainly not be disadvantaged through that transition period. At the end of that period they can, if they have a particular problem or inquiry, go through the Family Assistance Office. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that all Australian families will be better off; and they will be better off because of the substantial reductions in personal income tax and the increase - $2.4 billion - in family assistance which will benefit all families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. The government has received formal advice today from the Solicitor General about this issue. -  - You might want to listen to this. The advice is that, while the Australian Electoral Commission was entitled to supply the Commissioner of Taxation with a tape or disk of the electoral roll, such tape or disk could only be used for a purpose prescribed under section 91A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I am advised that regulations pursuant to this section have not been made except in relation to medical research and public health screening programs. The Taxation Office previously sought legal advice on the issue from the Australian Government Solicitor. In advices dated 19 May and 2 June the AGS advised the Taxation Office that the provision of the electoral roll to the Commissioner of Taxation and the use of the electoral roll by the Commissioner of Taxation for a mail-out were authorised under the Electoral Act. Advice to the same effect was given by the AGS to the Australian Electoral Commission dated 2 June and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet dated 6 June.This advice reflected a long-held view that the specific provision in the Electoral Act dealing with provision of information to prescribed authorities, such as the ATO, authorised provision to them and use by them of electoral information in electronic form. The Solicitor-General advised today that he disagreed with that advice. The Solicitor-General has indicated that a regulation as to the use of the electoral roll by authorised agencies should be made for the purposes of section 91A. I am advised that authorised federal government agencies - including the Australian Taxation Office, Customs, the National Crime Authority and the Passports Office - have been using electronic copies of the electoral roll since 1993 without the authority of prescribing regulations. In order to validate uses of the electoral roll already made in the past by federal government agencies, retrospective legislation dating from 1993 may be required. The government will rectify this as soon as possible through legislation, regulation or other appropriate action. On the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice the Commissioner of Taxation will not use the electoral roll for a mail-out to explain the benefits of the new tax system.  -  - Instead, the Treasurer has advised me that the Australian Taxation Office will distribute information on the new taxation system on a household distribution basis, not using the electoral roll.</DOC>

But, of course, the accusations that he makes are absolutely groundless. -  - One thing you have got to understand is that you can never take anything from the Australian Labor Party for granted. The most important element that families will have going though the new tax system is substantial personal income tax cuts, which will benefit Australian families. There will also be substantial increases in family assistance for a child. - In the new financial year under family tax benefit part B they will benefit from a $350 a year increase. Of course, there will also be substantial benefits that will go to young children under the age of five, because this government is very much family friendly -  - That is precisely why the taxation system is structured this way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I can advise him that one of the benefits of economic reform has been a lift in productivity growth in the Australian economy. Productivity growth over the last four years under the coalition government has averaged 2.6 per cent per annum compared with growth of only 1.5 per cent per annum under Labor. This has meant that Australian employees have been able to enjoy real wage increases. The policy of Labor was low productivity, real wage cuts and, as we know, high unemployment. But putting in place a new monetary policy, putting in place a surplus budgeting regime, putting in place labour market reform and increasing product competition in markets have given Australia a productivity lift. Today's labour force announcement illustrates some of the benefits that can come as a result. The labour force figures for May 2000 indicate that another 12,000 new jobs were created in Australia and that the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 per cent, the lowest since June 1990. That means that, since this government was elected, an additional 712,000 jobs have been created in Australia - people have got real, tangible benefits from the government's economic program.If we want to continue to make inroads into unemployment and if we want to give opportunities to young people to get jobs, we have to continue the reform process - we have to continue with tax reform and with labour market reform. It is Australia's role in pioneering these reforms which has brought it some respect from international organisations such as the IMF and the OECD. Indeed, Australia holds the chairmanship of the OECD this year and, on behalf of Australia, I will be chairing the annual ministerial meeting of the OECD in Paris commencing on Sunday, 25 June. This is in part a recognition of Australia's advances in competition reform, labour market reform, monetary reform, fiscal reform and institutional reform. The benefits that come from good economic management are real wage increases, more jobs, better opportunity and social benefits.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister indicated in this place only a couple of days ago, the government has always acted within the framework of propriety and appropriate behaviour. Your suggestion that he is wrong is, in fact, not right. We have done nothing illegal and nor has any government agency. You are making accusations that simply do not stand up. We have sought advice, a new point of concern has been raised and we have reacted in an appropriate way. That will be the case right through. There is no question that the government has or will act illegally in relation to the entirely defensible and very much needed explanation of these long overdue reforms to the Australian taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I am delighted to be able to advise the House that today's unemployment rate, at 6.7 per cent, is the equal lowest since June 1990. I would guess that all Australians would be delighted, except for those sitting on the other side, who find this news entirely depressing. This is great news. It is one of the best months we have had in 10 years and that reflects the fact that, with a government that is prepared to fix problems, you get good results. The figures have some other aspects to them. There is very good news for young people, who were thrown onto the scrap heap by Labor's mismanagement. Under this government the figure today is the lowest since October 1990. Again, happy faces on this side and glum faces on that side. This continues the good figures for young people: teenage full-time employment continued to rise strongly, to 243,000, and teenage full-time employment has grown by 5.1 per cent over the last 12 months. They are really good figures. The other interesting figure is that the participation rate stayed steady this time, but it is at its equal highest since August 1996. Compared to Labor's average of 62.4 per cent, ours is a significantly higher figure. So more people are in the labour market and more people are able to obtain jobs.I am asked whether or not there is any impediment to our doing better. Well, the impediments sit on the other side, and the union controlled Senate is blocking reforms. I am very interested in Queensland, which has struggled with unemployment. It was in September 1997 that the Queensland Premier said, `I'm confident that with some help from the federal arena we can get the figure down to five per cent within a term or just over.' Not only has he dumped that promise but, more ominously, he has dumped support for small business, which has created so many of these jobs. If you do not look after small business, you will not get the jobs. One of the worst so-called reforms in Queensland was that the state government made it easier for solicitors to blackmail small business people over unfair dismissal, which discourages job creation in the small business sector. But this is a great figure, and this government is determined to get it lower.</DOC>

 - This is coming from a member of the opposition, an opposition which have opposed almost all of the extraordinary length and breadth of worthwhile initiatives that the government has introduced in rural and regional Australia. There was $1.5 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust. Where were the ALP? They opposed it. Under Networking the Nation, there was $1 billion worth of expanded capability and technology for telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. Where were the ALP? They opposed it. There was $800 million for Agriculture Advancing Australia - a far more sophisticated package than the old Rural Adjustment Scheme, far more effective and far better appreciated. Where were the ALP? They opposed it, although I did see the shadow minister for agriculture the other day describe it as a popular program. There is no doubt about it: they oppose it until they realise it has been well received and it is working -  - The whole point of this is that an effective team in government are delivering very important outcomes for rural and regional Australia. The evidence is there that we are delivering as a government. It is as simple as that. Let me continue. With health, after the extraordinary neglect of the needs of the very large number of Australians who happen not to live in the major urban centres of this nation, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the government have put together a program to turn that around substantially to ensure that people in rural and regional Australia have the same sort of access to health that their city counterparts take for granted. I come to education. We have recently seen initiatives for people living in isolated areas, like the discounting of the assets test to enable small businesses and farmers who are asset rich but income poor to educate their children properly. All of that was done in the context of us having to right the budgetary mess that you left us. We were able to correct that and drive interest rates and inflation down - the two great killers that you allowed to eat away at the wellbeing of rural and regional Australia like a cancer. The question really is so trite as to be utterly laughable. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Billing procedures in hospitals do not get much attention, but they are a great annoyance to the public. This came home to me last time my family had to be involved in hospital care. It was when my last son was born. He spent two days in intensive care as a private patient, and we proceeded to get 50 bills over the next six months relating to that two-day episode of hospital care. That was in 1995. I thought it was utterly ridiculous. There are very few industries that would have treated their customers the way people who used the private health sector were being treated. In an attempt to do something about this, we ran some trials in 1997 to see whether we could actually collate the different claims, streamline the claiming process and provide informed financial consent. The trials went very well, and well over 90 per cent of people who participated in them found them to be of great benefit. So, in 1998, we changed the regulations to allow for simplified billing.Like most things in health care, change in the medical profession happens very slowly, but I am pleased to inform honourable members that it has started to really take off in recent months. In December 1998, only five per cent of private in-hospital treatments involved simplified billing. I got the results only today, but in the month of May, just a couple of weeks ago, 22 per cent of all in-hospital treatments for private patients in Australia used simplified billing. In most cases, this involves a single bill to the patient, informed financial consent and few or no out-of-pocket expenses. There are nearly 3,500 doctors around Australia who are now participating in this. There are 56,000 people who have benefited from it. It is a small change and a very quiet change, but it is removing one of the greatest concerns that the public have about using the private health sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She must be relying on other people's work, because she has not spent much time out in rural and regional Australia. -  - We have seen falls in unemployment rates right across Australia. In many statistical local areas, SLAs, the non-metropolitan areas, the falls have been quite significant and quite encouraging. For example, in the March quarter 2000, the unemployment rate in Coober Pedy fell from 20.5 per cent to 13.2 per cent. Come to Cootamundra: it went from 10 per cent to six per cent. Come to Geelong: 11.8 per cent to 8.9 per cent. Some 28 per cent of SLAs have an unemployment rate of less than five per cent, compared with 23 per cent in the March quarter a year ago. Employment grew in 16 of the 19 regions associated with Job Network 2. I think that is worth appreciating. The largest increase in employment was recorded from that fellow who was always criticising the government's policies but always benefiting from them in the Hunter and the North Coast region - up by 9.3 per cent. The largest decrease in unemployment was recorded in the Riverina - down by 35.6 per cent.Despite these figures, the government remains concerned about the need for further job development in rural and regional areas of this country. We have put in place a much more sound economic and other framework within which that can happen, whether it is lower interest rates, whether it is the lower inflation that I touched on earlier or whether it is industrial relations reform. I touched on that in this place yesterday. I do not know that anybody would care to speculate on the sorts of jobs that industrial relations inflexibility under the Labor Party/ACTU cost rural and regional Australia. How many jobs were exported from this country in the meat processing sector, for example, because you held our competitiveness back?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and for his representations on behalf of dairy farmers. It is indeed a fact that many dairy farmers, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, have concerns about the potential impact of dairy deregulation on them and their farming operations. I share some of those concerns. There is no doubt at all that dairy incomes will fall significantly in states like New South Wales and Queensland, and that is why the government has acted to put in place a $1.78 billion restructuring package to assist dairy farmers to adjust to these very difficult circumstances. It is important to recognise that the federal government has not been acting to deregulate the dairy industry. No-one in this parliament has voted for any legislation to deregulate dairying, nor will they. There are no federal regulations to be repealed. - I repeat, Mr Speaker, that all of the regulations in relation to dairying are state regulations, so it is a matter for the state parliaments as to whether or not any appropriate regulatory regime should be put in place. It is a matter for the states. Dairy farmers recognised that this week when they protested outside the parliaments in Brisbane and Sydney when regulations were under consideration by their state parliaments. So it is very important - and dairy farmers recognise this fact - that it is a decision for the states. It is a decision that they have in fact recommended to the states. The dairy industry have known now for eight or more years that the current regulatory regime was to expire, so they have been seeking to find ways in which the industry could appropriately trade and effectively meet the challenges of the future. They came to the federal government with a proposal that we should support by way of an adjustment package a move to total deregulation of the industry. That deregulation is not being driven by the federal government; it is not even essentially being driven by the national competition policy. The reality is that 63 per cent of Australia's dairy products are produced in Victoria, and Victorians have long eyed the more lucrative Sydney and Brisbane markets and have been keen to supply product into those states. They are protected by section 92 of the Constitution in having that right to trade freely into other states. Victorians ask, if products grown in New South Wales are allowed to be sold in Victoria, why can't Victorian products be sold in New South Wales?I appreciate that there are concerns in some of the industries, so at five minutes to midnight we have had a number of proposals around about schemes that might be able to, say, re-regulate the industry. There was a proposal, for instance, that maybe the quota scheme could somehow or other be extended if, in fact, other state dairy producers were able to buy those quotas. The Queensland Solicitor-General obtained a legal opinion that that would not be consistent with section 92. The New South Wales government's legal opinion was the same. That opinion was tabled in the Queensland parliament. I have to say that our own legal opinion supports that view.Lately, there has been a proposal that perhaps there could be some kind of floor price scheme. Minister Amery in New South Wales has promoted this idea. Mr Amery would know as well as anyone else that this is a cruel hoax on New South Wales dairy farmers. He knows that the Commonwealth has no powers to fix prices. That has been affirmed in referendums on a number of occasions over the years. For the federal government to regulate prices, it would require a referral from all of the states. I have never known states like Queensland or Western Australia to be too keen to refer powers to the Commonwealth, and in this particular case Victoria would have to do it as well. Victoria has already passed its legislation through both houses of parliament. I might add as well that Victoria has made it abundantly clear that it has no intention of backing away from dairy deregulation. Max Fehring, the President of the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria, said just a couple of days ago:Unfortunately, there are still some groups who believe that deregulation can be stopped. Lets be clear, deregulation will occur. He has been supported in those comments by Bonlac Foods, Murray Goulburn Cooperative and the major processors in that state. Let me add as well that the fact that the Commonwealth does not have powers to introduce a floor price scheme is also supported by legal opinion from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General and almost any other lawyer you would care to ask about those sorts of issues. Those sorts of things are cruel attempts by people like Minister Amery to distract attention from the failure of the New South Wales government and the Queensland government to do anything to support the dairy farmers of that state. Their behaviour has been shameful. - If Country Labor are serious about any kind of a floor price scheme, then they should be on the phone to Premier Bracks and Premier Beattie asking whether they are prepared to transfer any powers to the Commonwealth to deal with that issue - and you know what the answer will be. But that is not all of it. The real problem is that there are three states that have got dairy quotas, where farmers have bought the right to supply this high priced market milk - Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. The Western Australian government, a coalition government, has provided $38 million in additional support for the dairy farmers in that state. Queensland and New South Wales, who have more dairy farmers and whose dairy farmers are suffering more, have done absolutely nothing. They are prepared to provide nothing. They are appropriating the assets of these farmers - their quotas that they paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for and that they paid stamp duty on to the state governments in transferring these amounts - and the governments are prepared to give them absolutely nothing by way of compensation. It is high time that those state governments accepted their responsibilities, took up the challenge to look after the farmers in those states and delivered appropriate compensation for the assets they are proposing to appropriate. </DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. -  - I have to say that I am very surprised that a member of the opposition would ask a question critical of a $1.78 billion assistance package to Australian dairy farmers. -  - This is the biggest adjustment package in the history of Australian agriculture. It is an extraordinary achievement for this federal government to have put together a proposal of this magnitude in response to the specific request of the dairy industry for aid through this difficult period. It is also interesting to note that members opposite who are now criticising it actually voted for it - they actually voted for it at the time. Are they going to wind back this $1.78 billion package? Are they opposed to it? Are they against providing this support to the dairy industry?In relation to the nature of the package and the assistance that is being provided, originally the industry asked us for a package of about $1.2 billion tax free. But, because it was not practical to provide it in a tax-free manner, the package was actually boosted so that at least as much, and in fact more, money will actually go to growers than otherwise would have occurred. There has always been some suggestion that somehow or other this is not the federal government's money, and I have heard certain members opposite say that in the past. No government has any money of its own. The only money that governments ever have is what they take from the taxpayers. Is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition actually suggesting that Labor's wholesale sales tax was not the government's money? It was the consumers' money. So the reality is, of course, that this is being funded by a tax. It is being funded by a tax on milk but it is being provided by the federal government, through its taxing powers, to provide a real benefit to the dairy farmers of Australia.Let me just add one further point, and I find it quite remarkable again that there should be criticism of a dairy regional communities package - something not, I might add, sought by the minister from Tasmania. He was not very keen to support these sorts of things, but he was grateful to receive it when the federal government offered it. He was very grateful to take it, like the premiers lining up for the GST who were happy to take their share of it and then seek to be provided with some credit for it. This will help dairy communities that are also affected by dairy industry deregulation. But it highlights once again the difference between what federal government is doing and what state government is doing. Ask the states. Ask your Labor agricultural minister in Tasmania or Mr Amery in New South Wales, or Mr Palaszczuk in Queensland? What are they doing to provide community support for dairy communities? Absolutely nothing. Not a thing is coming from the states that are actually doing the deregulation. It is the states that are passing this legislation. It is the states' regulation that is being repealed. They should be providing assistance, not just to dairy farmers but also to their communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and I recognise the very active role that he plays in promoting the opportunities that are being provided to the constituents and the producers in his electorate of Mallee in opening up and improving market access across the world; he does a very good job. I thank him for the question. I am pleased to report to the House that the meeting of ministers responsible for trade in the APEC region that met in Darwin this week and concluded yesterday afternoon was, indeed, a successful meeting. Given the failure of the Seattle meeting at the end of last year to launch a round, the eyes of the world, in a trade sense, were on this meeting in Darwin to see what the 21 representatives of those member economies were going to decide with regard to their position on getting on with launching a round of multilateral trade negotiations. Of course, APEC is a significant forum. APEC represents almost 60 per cent of global GDP, and certainly about 70 per cent of the markets into which Australia exports are APEC economies. So it is an important forum, one that after 10 years of activity has produced some concrete results in terms of market openings and strengthening the regional economies within the APEC region. Australia produced a document that outlines the work in progress within APEC and presented that this week. It will be presented at the leaders meeting later this year in Brunei. It identified some very critical elements of what has been achieved by APEC in terms of strengthening and helping those economies to withstand the economic recession that has beset the region in recent years. All those economies are now starting to come out of that recession. Some of the activities and the focus of reforms within APEC have certainly helped those economies. Australia went along chairing the ministerial this week wanting to achieve a couple of outcomes. We wanted an Auckland plus outcome - that is, we wanted to reaffirm the commitment, made by our leaders in Auckland last year, to launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations. I am pleased to report that we did that and there was unanimous support for the statement our leaders made last year pushing the WTO to launch a broadly based round of trade negotiations as soon as possible. Over and above that, we also resolved that we should ask the WTO to start doing some preparatory work on industrial tariffs in advance of the launch of a round. This would mean more preparation would be done not only in the area of agriculture and services and the technical barriers to trade but also in the area of industrial tariffs. That was supported by representatives of the 21 economies. We agreed to establish a moratorium on the establishment of any customs duties on e-commerce between now and whenever a new round of trade negotiations is launched. Again, that is an APEC initiative which we believe should spread across the global trading area. That is a very important measure. The other thing looked at at the ministerial this week, and this was led by Australia, was the focus that we are giving to the use of e-commerce and information technology in facilitating more trade in the region. That was clearly accepted and applauded by our colleagues within the APEC group.The question also asked about alternative policies. I said in this House last week that the Australian Labor Party are going to be challenged by the union movement at their upcoming conference as to whether they stand by the credentials that they have established over the last decade or so. It remains to be seen. We have Doug Cameron still rattling the bushes wanting to roll things back. We have seen the Labor Party move away from a commitment to workplace agreements. We are going to see the Labor Party move away from the agenda of pursuing freer and open trade across the globe. It is going to be an interesting debate on this issue between Senator Cook, the member for Fraser, Doug and Shazza down there in Hobart. It will not just be exporters in Australia who will be watching this debate. A lot of people around the world who you used to do business with when you were in government are waiting to see whether you are going to change colours at this year's conference. We have achieved a very important outcome out of this week's APEC ministerial. It provides the impetus in terms of global trade to get on with the reform agenda. It gives a positive agenda after the failed meeting in Seattle last year. </DOC>

 - The Labor Party's grandstanding on this issue hides the simple reality that the Prime Minister announced yesterday that he was seeking further advice on the matter. The government has been acting in accordance with legal advice that it has received from the outset, as was done by agencies under Labor for a long time. When the advice changed so did the government's approach. The fact of the matter is that, at all times, proper and appropriate initiatives were used to explain the new tax system - much needed in this country; acknowledged by you in all of your unbelievable rhetoric by the mere fact that you are committed to retaining the tax system. The smoother its introduction, the more satisfactory from the point of view of the Australian economy. The government is, of course, keen to ensure that the transition is smooth. In this case, the Prime Minister made it very plain that we would, at all times, act in accordance with advice given to us. He indicated he was seeking further advice. We got that and we have reacted accordingly. It has nothing to do with the grandstanding of a couple of your senators on this matter. </DOC>

 - As per usual, the question is full of false assumptions and premised to be so. As the Attorney-General made clear earlier on, the Solicitor-General takes a view of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which the government accepts, which indicates that, since 1993, Commonwealth government agencies on that view would have been in breach of the Electoral Act. Commonwealth agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office and the National Crime Authority, under Labor's administration, on that view of the act breached it. More than that, the government has now been advised that it will have to enact either legislation or regulation retrospectively to cure the breaching of the act under the Labor administration by those agencies. If I sound as though I am repudiating all of the assumptions in the question, I have very strong grounds on which to do so. What the government will be doing, as was announced by the Attorney-General on the advice of the Australian Taxation Office, is ensuring that there is a household delivery - that is, the brochure that was being printed will be used for a household delivery. The difference between using the electoral roll, which addresses by name, and a household delivery is that the household delivery is addressed to `Dear householder'. It will be done at a lower cost than the original -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - The member for Griffith last night started to speak at some length on advertising in the state of Queensland. It reminded me of some negotiations I have had recently with the Queensland government relative to a regional forest agreement. As the House would know, there is considerable cost in researching the science, the social impact and all the aspects of a regional forest agreement. There was I, on behalf of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, spending money funding those programs. While I was funding them, what were the Queensland government doing? While their officials were negotiating - themselves believing in good faith - Beattie and Elder were out there putting together a television advertisement and a media campaign to advertise an entirely different outcome from that arrangement.It would have been interesting if that TV and print media advertising contained some advice to the 100 sawmill workers in Cooroy who have been dismissed, as a result of the agreement they were publicising, as to how they might raise and look after their kids on the dole. They could have told them where the local jobs place was. They could have told them where Centrelink was. They could have done all that in the advertisement, but, no. Did they put anything in the advertisement to tell small business in Cooroy how they might handle the reduced turnover that will result from their activities? No, they just had blatant political advertising. Then Mr Beattie got criticised for his energy policy on greenhouse issues. So what did he do? He bought full-page advertisements in the Weekend Australian and the Courier-Mail - and I will table them - telling them all about how he is going to have a new policy based on a gas pipeline that has not even been approved for development yet. Is that giving any special advice to the community about power bills or anything of that nature? Oh, no.But there is another aspect of the costs of this industry and the benefits that will arise at an industry level and on a personal basis from the new tax system. Fuel and transport costs are very significant in the forest products industry, and they will clearly come down. Many of those forest operatives who own their own trucks will be direct beneficiaries. There is another aspect at the personal level. The budget for a typical sawmill family is heavily influenced by the type of work they undertake. As for mechanics and others, it is a dirty job, and they find themselves with their family budgets influenced by such products as washing powder, stain remover, detergents and household cleaners, all of which are now subject to Labor's 22 per cent WST. We never see the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bring any household or personal cleaning products in here. In fact, I don't think they ever wash!   - They never talk about the 22 per cent stuff.</DOC>

 - The entire premise upon which the question was asked makes it quite apparent that the shadow minister for agriculture in Australia does not understand how tax reform will work. He does not understand it. He parades himself around as the farmers' friend, alongside the member for Batman and the member for Hotham. He says that he is the farmers' friend, but he does not understand something as elementary as a rebatable indirect tax system. The reality is that no-one has pushed harder for tax reform in this country than the nation's farm leaders over a very long period of time. They have done so because the current indirect tax system loads up farmers, along with other exporters, with costs all the way along the train. In fact, some $4½ billion of embedded taxes on exporters will be removed under the new tax system. The average savings for an Australian farmer are estimated to be of the order of $8,000 to $10,000. When it comes to the specifics of this question -  - They are the issues that are being addressed, and I am about to come to the particular matter that he raises. The fact of the matter is, as the Treasurer just said, any GST that might in the first instance be payable is refundable for business expenses. In relation to the issue of leases, quite frankly I think it is insulting to suggest that Australia's farmers, in common with their bankers and people who operate leases, will not be able to find - perfectly legally, perfectly respectably - financial packages that will in fact advantage them fully in terms of the changes to the taxation arrangements that are about to apply. It is as simple as that. Really, in terms of the timing of purchases and the construction of the lease, tailor-made financial packages are the order of the day for farmers today. They will have no problems with this whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I am aware of such claims. This week the member for Prospect put out a press release attacking the government because an Employment National office in Fairfield in metropolitan Sydney had recently closed and because there had been a small rise in local unemployment. - She said that the government had all but forgotten Fairfield. I want to assure the member for Prospect that Fairfield is very much in my thoughts. Let me tell the member for Prospect that, while there was just one CES office in Fairfield when she was in government, there are now no fewer than eight Job Network sites in Fairfield. There are five Job Network sites offering intensive assistance -   -  - There are five Job Network members in Fairfield offering intensive assistance as well as other services including the Adult Multicultural Education Service, Centacare, Mission Australia and Wesley Employment. If you take the Fairfield-Liverpool statistical region, unemployment peaked there at 22.2 per cent in October 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. It was 20 per cent in December 1995 when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. It was 16.4 per cent in March 1996 when the coalition took office, and it is currently 8.5 per cent. It is still far too high, but the member for Prospect should give credit where it is due. She says that Fairfield needs `jobs not words'. She is absolutely right and all it is getting from the local member is hot air and all it is getting from the local Labor Party is the union bloc vote, the socialisation clause and rampant ethnic branch stacking. I suggest to the member for Prospect that, while she has given worthy service to her community, if this is the best she can do she ought to go back to polishing her MBE and offer preselection to Jennie George so that yet another ACTU boss can treat the parliament as a retirement home.</DOC>

 - Not only friends of the bushies but friends of the MUA. I know it has escaped those opposite, but we are an exporting nation. A lot of Australian jobs, a lot of Australian prosperity depends upon our export performance. They were the masters at exporting Australian jobs, particularly in primary industries. But the fact is that we have been prepared to push ahead with sensible and meaningful reform on our waterfront, and we have also been prepared to pursue shipping reform. In accordance with the Navigation Act 1912, single voyage permits in this country are issued where there is no suitable licensed ship available and it is considered to be in the public interest that an unlicensed ship be allowed to engage in coastal movements of domestic freight. This represents a balance between providing a preference for licensed ships and the commercial needs of Australian shippers moving cargo interstate. There are a number of matters here that are currently before the courts which I do not intend to expound upon at this point in time. - In relation to that particular point, I can only say that if there is some sort of suggestion here that you have evidence of illegal behaviour that I am not aware of I would like to see it. </DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the member for Makin for her question and I also thank her for the opportunity, on her invitation, to visit her electorate of Makin. Whilst I was there I saw the very close relationship that she has with the veteran community. I was also rather saddened to see where the Kokoda Walkway, which is an Australia Remembers program, has been vandalised for the second time. It saddened me to think there are people in our community who would vandalise walkways and memorials that have been put there for very good reasons. My Department of Veterans' Affairs has had a very long history of caring for our veterans. In fact, I think they do a superb job. However, the Vietnam Veterans Health Study, which was funded by this government, has found that the families of Vietnam veterans have suffered as a result of the veterans' war service. The government's response to this was to provide $32.3 million, which was set aside in the budget, to increase support for Vietnam veterans and their families through a range of health, lifestyle and counselling services and also other programs. Some of those initiatives are: the automatic access to treatment for Vietnam veterans diagnosed with clinical depression or severe anxiety disorders; also, for the very first time, there will now be lifetime care for Vietnam veterans' children with spina bifida and cleft palate - and $2.8 million over the next four years has been provided for that. Further to that there will be free psychiatric assessment of Vietnam veterans' partners and their adult children and also there will be the extension of counselling through the excellent service that is provided by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and, importantly, that will be available to ex-partners of veterans who have lived with a veteran within the past five years, acknowledging that many families have split up because of the problems that the veterans suffer from. So we have acknowledged that in our response as well.There will be more than 100 additional Vietnam veterans counselling services, lifestyle and psycho-educational therapy group programs to veterans, partners and, importantly, their children. There will be an extension of access to the Veterans' Children Education Scheme for children assessed as being at risk of suicide. There will be new bursaries to assist financially disadvantaged students in making a transition into tertiary study. We will be providing some health information kits and additional funding for research. We will also be expanding the National Centre for War Related PTSD, which helps not only Vietnam veterans but all veterans of war and conflict, and it also helps their families.Subject to the successful passage of these measures, I hope that we can get these in place by 1 July this year. I certainly look forward to the opposition's support when those measures come forward prior to 30 June. I thank the member for Makin for her question because it was a very important one about a response to the health needs of Vietnam veterans and their children.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. And, as it happens, I can inform you of yet another very solid building block in this government's building, if you like, of a really sound approach to helping rural and regional Australia craft a new future for itself. Over the weekend we announced a $90 million grants program to be known as the Regional Solutions Fund. This very well put together program is designed to meet a specific need that was identified at last year's regional Australia summit and by others, I have to say, both before and since. It centres on the fact that many, many communities in rural and regional Australia have identified, in times of great change when they face very real economic difficulties, opportunities for economic diversification and new jobs. They have identified new chances and they need a bit of help to snare them. It can range over everything from value adding through to tourist based industries, including ecotourism and so forth, through to multifunction training centres, through to some of the hi-tech opportunities that are now beginning to emerge. It is a very flexible program. Its objective is jobs, and it recognises that one size does not fit all; we have learnt that. We need to say clearly to people in rural and regional Australia that we have learnt that the view that Canberra knows best is not something that the coalition accepts is right.We want to work in partnership with rural, regional and remote communities as they work to craft a new future. We know, of course, that that involves working alongside people with drive, vision and imagination. That is what made the bush great in the first place. We saw some of it in Moree last week, and it was a great privilege to have the Prime Minister and other frontbenchers and people with a real interest in this, including members from Sydney, looking at strong local leadership and communities taking themselves forward in partnership with the Commonwealth government in providing aid for things like Aboriginal employment. Two types of communities will be particularly targeted: those with high population growth but attendant high unemployment, such as in the south-east of Queensland, and the other will be rural communities where there is serious population decline and economic stagnation. There will be an independent advisory committee to assess applications against specific requirements. It dovetails very well with the other initiatives in place such as Networking the Nation, a billion dollar program, which was opposed, of course, by the ALP; the Stronger Families and Communities program, which is about community empowerment and building social capital; and the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal. It all contributes very significantly to the bag of tools that rural and regional Australians have at their disposal for crafting a future.</DOC>

 - Since the question was in relation to figures I released last night, I am only too happy to answer the question and to inform the House. Last night I released figures from an Econtech report, not a government report, which had been done on boarding houses and which compared the difference between input taxation - that is, the taxation which is given in relation to residential rents - and the alternative taxation where there is the half-GST and full input tax credits. That report showed that in the short term the difference between the two taxation treatments is minimal. If you used the concessional GST treatment, you would get a price impact of four per cent in the short term, and if you used the other alternative - namely, input taxation - you would get 3.6 per cent. That is, the difference was marginal - almost non-existent. It also showed, interestingly enough, that in the long term, if you took the concessional GST treatment, the price effect would be 1.5, whereas on a boarding house if you took the input tax treatment, it would be 3.1. In other words, if you took the option out of the legislation, in the long term you would be penalising people in boarding houses. The government has always said that the two treatments work out approximately the same. They do, in the short term. In the long term, it actually works out more beneficially if you take the concessional treatment. This was not government modelling; this was Econtech modelling. It was done by an independent modeller, which I would have thought puts the kybosh on all of the ALP claims - notwithstanding that very interesting photo in the Sydney Morning Herald of independent caravan park owners in the Tweed over the weekend.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I was with him on national accounts day at the Benito Club, where he had a wonderful meeting with friends, supporters and people in the Italian community. He would have heard me say on that day that the national accounts showed that, in the March quarter of 2000, GDP grew by 1.1 per cent to record through the year growth of 4.3 per cent. This was the 12th consecutive quarter in which the Australian economy grew in through the year terms by four per cent or more. Such an outcome has only once been previously recorded in Australia, and that was the period from June 1968 to March 1971. In other words, it is the equal longest, consistent growth above four per cent in Australian history. If the June quarter were to continue with growth at above four per cent, we would have the longest unbroken run of growth above four per cent in Australian recorded economic history.I think all members of the House would agree that it is good news to see a strongly growing Australian economy creating more jobs for young people, reducing unemployment and, in particular, showing that not only has this been a consistently strongly growing economy but it has been a low inflation economy, with the inflation indicators in the national accounts showing through the year 1.2 per cent inflation. The important thing about economic policy in this country is that we keep the economic cycle running. We can continue to keep the Australian economy growing at four per cent or in the high threes, as we are forecasting, in 2000-01. We will continue to create jobs, unemployment will continue to fall and we will be creating better opportunities for our fellow Australians. But you will not get that by doing nothing. It is important that this government continue to work on all of those areas of economic policy which have shown results over the last couple of years - tax reform, of course, is the big one. But we need to keep going to ensure that we give our fellow Australians the opportunities which they deserve in a growing economy with more job creation. </DOC>

We indicated that there should be no net cost.  -  - There is nothing wrong with that; it is entirely appropriate.

 - It is a fact that, whilst the Australian economy is growing so rapidly, there are segments of the Australian community that have not been so fortunate. But it is a tragedy when that situation is not brought on by normal economic events but by political decisions taken by, in this case, the Carr state government. The people of Eden have been driven into the ground by a policy perpetrated, introduced and practised by the Carr government in closing down to an unnecessary degree the forest industry upon which they rely. Unfortunately, their major employer in the Heinz fish cannery, employing about 130 people, has also closed, causing great concern to the community.The response of the Howard government was not to let this situation continue and lay the blame without doing something about it. It is of great interest to me to hear the Deputy Prime Minister say that proposals of this nature that I will soon be mentioning are now to be extended to other similar areas throughout Australia. This morning, in the company of Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, and the member for Eden-Monaro, Mr Nairn, I went to Eden to announce the first stage of a project that we implemented using some of our forestry funds to get a rebuild of that area's activities in business. This has been an interesting process because it has been implemented by the people of the region themselves. Instead of trying to apply a process from Canberra, on the member's recommendation a committee has been formed there under the chairmanship of Mr John Aveyard, advertising was conducted and, as a result of that, a large number of applications were accepted. We were looking for those that might come up with expenditures as high as $3.6 million. We have received applications for about $14 million and this morning were able to announce the first group at a cost to the government of $1.355 million but which will result in local expenditure of $6 million, with 55 new jobs immediately and with the opportunity to extend out to 100 new jobs. The grants extended between $8,000 to over $400,000 for individual proposals and each is at least matched dollar for dollar, if not better. So it is not just the government doing things, it is other people doing so also. Included in those activities are forestry, fisheries, fish processing, aquaculture, tourism, light industry and horticultural industry activities. It is a wide spread and it is a great employment creating opportunity. In fact, it is a process of the Commonwealth government and the Prime Minister's initiative, along with the local member, giving back what Bob Carr took away. Throughout New South Wales and other parts we have people running around calling themselves Country Labor. The media said to me this morning, `What should Mr Carr be doing?' I said, `For God's sake keep out of Eden. Every time he goes there he takes something off them. He never gives anything.' Our response is to be positive, to go to the community, ask them how they think this matter should be dealt with -    - The member for Dickson laughs. She apparently works on the principle that she knows all. You trot off to London, find out what to do, come back here and then impose something -  -  - She has been there to get advice on employment. The reality of this is that we have put together a program to assist people to assist themselves. That program has been of not substantial cost to the government but it certainly has had a very worthwhile effect, because the people of the region -  - My grandson interjects. He is a great help. I have got to say that this morning none of Country Labor turned up to get their photograph taken with the 12 successful applicants from the electorate but the local people were all very grateful to the local member. I want to congratulate him in closing because he has worked assiduously to make sure that people like me and the Prime Minister knew of the difficulties confronting his own people. It is amazing how, when you create jobs for people, those opposite giggle. They would rather have a situation where people were out of work and queueing up to get the dole. I think that is their view. The member for Eden-Monaro knows that the way to help people is to get them real jobs that last and get investment that will last, and this investment being matched there will create a large number of new jobs and I think will bring great benefit to that region. It is to be followed by a series of other activities when we are able to further investigate some of the larger projects, ensure their financial viability and probably double or treble those jobs.</DOC>

 - Here comes a question from a team who had such a great vision for transport infrastructure, for rail and transcontinental railways and so forth that every time they went out to reform or invest in something we went backwards. We repair a bit of railway and then the trains travel slower on it after the repair job than before. That was the way Labor went about these sorts of things.The background to this is that in 1997 the Commonwealth, New South Wales and ACT governments invited proposals for a high speed train service between Sydney and Canberra. In August 1998 the Prime Minister announced that the three governments had agreed to proceed with a proving-up process with Speedrail. The purpose of the proving-up process was to give Speedrail an opportunity to demonstrate that its proposal is commercially viable and would have no net cost to government. It is no secret that quite a bit of work has now been completed by Speedrail. We are analysing that. I have to say it is incredibly complex. It is getting to the point where all three governments will be considering it formally, but all sorts of interesting propositions are put in terms of net cost and we will have to make careful evaluation of savings that might relate to areas such as expenditure on roads, outcomes involving environmental and greenhouse considerations, the final value to the asset at such point when it may return to the Commonwealth -   - Mr Speaker, I think I am talking about a train, not a pipeline. Quite simply, in the end we will have to form a judgment about the value of the final proposition that is put before us. Obviously we will have to do that. That is what governments are elected to do. I cannot predetermine what values in net terms, if you want to put it that way, the cabinet may determine to put upon the proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question and for his interest in fuel arrangements in the state of Queensland. If I could go back a step, in 1997 the High Court invalidated business franchise fees that had been imposed by states. The states unanimously asked the Commonwealth to step in and, with uniform excise and wholesale sales tax, raise the money which the court had said the state could not raise for itself. The Commonwealth could impose those wholesale sales taxes and excises only at uniform rates. So it imposed them at the highest rate of any of the states, passed the money across to the states and said to those states that had lower rates, `You must use this money to resubsidise your product so that its price does not move.' In Queensland there was no business franchise fee on petrol, so that, when the Commonwealth stepped in and raised the same amount per state and paid the money to Queensland, it was on the condition that the Queensland government subsidise its petrol 8c a litre so that the price did not rise. That arrangement has been put in place, through correspondence and agreement, since 1997.Mr Speaker, you can imagine our surprise at the announcement by the Beattie Labor government in Queensland that it would be abolishing that subsidy arrangement, that it would be taking the money from the Commonwealth and, rather than passing it on to consumers, pocketing the money or otherwise applying it to a state tax under cover of the taxation changes of the Commonwealth, trying to shift the benefit and to blame the Commonwealth. I ask you this question: if Mr Beattie was genuinely concerned about that subsidy arrangement, why did he not cease it when he was first elected? Why did he not threaten to cease it at the end of last year? Why would he not threaten to cease it at the end of next year? Why was it that he chose the magical date of 1 July 2000 to try to abolish his subsidy? Because he was deviously trying to blame the Commonwealth when prices went up in Queensland. As a result of a lot of good work by a lot of people on this side of the parliament, he has been forced to back off that scheme - a thoroughly devious scheme. I would have welcomed one ALP voice criticising the Beattie plan. The ALP will tell you that they are worried about the price of petrol, but when an 8c a litre straight out price impact was being threatened by the Beattie Labor government, the silence was absolutely deafening. I pay tribute to those members of the Liberal and National parties that stood up for Queenslanders and have ensured that Queenslanders were not being disadvantaged.We are seeing an attempt to do the same thing in relation to alcohol. Again, when the Commonwealth had a uniform rate and paid the money to the states, those states which had previously not taxed light alcohol beer agreed to use the money to subsidise light alcohol beer for public health reasons. On 1 July, when taxes change in this country, Western Australia is going to keep its subsidy and South Australia is going to keep its subsidy on light alcohol beer. Even the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, has now agreed to keep it. On 2 June 2000 on the Ross Warneke program, Mr Bracks said:We've already made a decision on low alcohol beer, which had an $18 million subsidy to keep a differential price, and on good public policy grounds, that is, to ensure that we reduced the road toll.So he is keeping his subsidy on light alcohol. - Western Australia is not trying to cheat on that subsidy. South Australia is not trying to cheat on that subsidy. The Premier of Victoria has now come to the conclusion that he should not do that. - I raised this issue in the parliament some weeks ago in relation to Tasmania. I can inform the House that the Tasmanian government has reversed its position and has done the right thing. I pay tribute to the Treasurer of Tasmania, Dr David Crean, who, I think on the afternoon that I raised this in the parliament, put out a statement - and I will table it - dated 7 June saying, `Subsidies for cider and beer to stay'. I commend the Tasmanian government for its stand. But there is one state government in this country which is trying to deviously use the tax changes of 1 July 2000 to wipe out a subsidy on low alcohol: it is the Labor government of New South Wales. The Labor government of New South Wales expects to be paid the money for a subsidy which it intends not to pass on to consumers. - Labor members from New South Wales interject in defence of the Carr government taking away a subsidy on low alcohol. There is only one state. Why would it be that Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania have all adopted that position and New South Wales stands alone? It is because New South Wales thinks it can get away with this, that it can use the cover of 1 July 2000 to take out a subsidy and to try to put up the price of low alcohol beer. I call on the Labor Party to criticise the New South Wales Labor government and to demand that that subsidy be passed on. I say that, on this side of the parliament, we will be sticking up for the consumers of New South Wales. We will not see them cheated by the Labor government of New South Wales. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, what the shadow minister for employment fails to understand is that the old CES figures needed to be adjusted in order to make a valid comparison because the old CES figures counted as jobs a whole lot of outcomes that we do not count as outcomes now. For instance, the old CES figures counted as an outcome a job that lasted for simply one hour. - They counted as outcomes placements in labour market programs that were funded by the Commonwealth government. If you adjust the figures as they should be adjusted in the relevant year -  - It was in 1995-96. When you guys were in charge and you thought the CES was running at full bore, in the relevant year the appropriate CES figure that has been provided to me by my department is 205,680, and in the last 12 months the Job Network has made 293,000 placements. So the Job Network is performing 50 per cent better than the CES at its height in 1995-96. If the CES is as good as the member for Dickson says, does she want to restore the CES? Is that what the member for Dickson wants to do? Does the member for Dickson want to restore the CES? Does the member for Dickson want to strip organisations like Mission Australia, the Salvation Army and Work Directions of their contracts and go back to the old days of the CES? Because that is precisely the import of the question you have asked. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for blackguarding the Job Network, a great organisation - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is some good news in this area. On Sunday, the Australian Health Insurance Association released some figures that suggested that in April and May, 250,000 Australians had taken out private health cover. We would expect that figure to double by the end of this quarter. Since we introduced the 30 per cent rebate, there are now three-quarters of a million Australians who have private health cover who would not have had otherwise. If the trend that we faced when we came to government had continued, there would be two million fewer Australians with private health cover. This extra number of people is good news. It is good news for those who are already covered because it will take pressure off premiums next year. We have every reason to expect that premium rises next year will be even lower than the very low rise this year. If you believe people such as New South Wales Premier Bob Carr or Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, it will also help their hospital systems. We have given many Australians a significant choice that they have not had. This makes a significant contribution to health care in Australia as a whole.Unfortunately, we still have the odd lone voice trying to talk down this change. It would not surprise you that the member for Jagajaga said on radio yesterday that people are furious about being blackmailed into private health insurance. If this is the case, I am puzzled why the opposition bothered to support the legislation in the first place. It is an example of saying one thing to one group of people and another thing to another group of people and standing for nothing whatsoever. I checked to see whether my office was being inundated with such phone calls. We log calls coming into the electorate office. Since the beginning of June, we have had a total of 12 phone calls on this matter. Two of the callers would seem to have been reading from a prepared script. We put them in the same category as Chris of Waramanga and we ignored them. Of the other 10, two were supportive and eight had some difficulties. But 10 phone calls in three weeks is hardly an inundation. I would suggest that the member for Jagajaga listen to a former Labor health minister who, at the same time as she was being critical on Melbourne radio, was saying this on Sydney radio: I actually think that these moves from Michael Wooldridge are very sensible. The truth is at the moment everyone who is in the funds is ageing and that blows out the cost for all time for everyone who is in the fund, so this can't be a bad idea.He is dead right.</DOC>

 - I assume that the shadow minister for employment accepts that people who do not do the right thing should be breached. On the basis that she accepts the basic principle that people should do as they are required by this government, I am sorry to hear that this particular job seeker has had some difficulties, and obviously that question will be looked at. If she would like to give me the details of the relevant situation, I will happily look at it and happily address the matter. The point I would make is that we are serious about trying to ensure that job seekers live up to their obligations. Thanks to the efforts that this government has put in, thanks to the reforms that we have made, thanks to the principle of mutual obligation that we have brought in and thanks to so many other things, unemployment has come down from the 11.2 per cent it was under members opposite to under 7 per cent now. So I think you have to say that whatever administrative and technical issues might still afflict our system it is a lot better than that of members opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. The High Court's decision was a very important one. It was a big win for the government's reform process which we introduced in 1996. It is a great win for the system as we try to modernise it. The upshot of that is that with a more modern system we will see a more vital business community. We will see more jobs created as a result. Under this government, over 466 individual awards have been simplified and over 1,200 obsolete awards have been removed. This produces a tangible benefit for workers. For example, as a result of simplifying the clerks award minimum rate increases have been up to $100 per week. This was because the award had not been properly maintained. Our process ensured that it was.Secondly, we see more flexible working arrangements. That means that workers have more opportunities to work when they want to and under the circumstances they want. Also, this process has led to the removal of a number of restrictive and outdated work practices, for example, the last on, first off rule, which was the subject of this matter in the High Court. Allan Woods put it so very well in the Australian after the decision came down when he said: It was an attempt by the CFMEU to protect union rorts that sheltered the work-shy.We are proud of the fact that this government's reforms have led to more pay for workers, a more modern system and, ultimately, more jobs. This decision highlights how backward the Labor Party is on this issue. When Paul Keating was Prime Minister he said that we ought to simplify the award system. When this decision came down, the Labor Party's position was that not only was it opposed to the simplification of awards but also it wanted to bring back all the complexity of the old system. Only this government can deliver a modern system which is good for workers, good for business and which will create jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that Dow Jones reports from New York today that Moody's sovereign analyst for Australia has reported in the following terms:The Australian tax changes scheduled to begin in July will stimulate growth and could reduce the country's current account deficit.Mr Yves Lemay said:I think the tax reform which will come into place in July is a positive step. It is positive in terms of economic efficiency, a tax structure which should encourage growth.That is international confirmation from New York today from the sovereign analyst of Moody's. Not only is that the view of Moody's in relation to the Australian taxation changes; it is also the view of the International Monetary Fund. In February this year, the International Monetary Fund notice stated:Directors welcome the extensive tax reform under way which will improve the integrity and fairness of the tax system.Not only is it the view of Moody's, not only is it the view of the IMF, but it is also the view of the OECD, which, in its release in December of last year, said:The introduction of a more efficient tax system in July should help to consolidate the productivity gains now being seen in Australia. Commencing on Sunday of next week the OECD - which is the organisation of the developed countries of the world - will be meeting in Paris. When the developed countries of the world meet in Paris for the OECD meeting next week, there will be only one country at the table with a wholesale sales tax, and it will be Australia. It will be the only country in the world - seven days off the greatest reform of the taxation system - left with a wholesale sales tax. There will be no political representative at the table still supporting a wholesale sales tax because the representatives of Australia will be at that table supporting tax reform. Outside of Swaziland, the only political movement in the world that still supports wholesale sales tax is the Australian Labor Party. Botswana has given up on wholesale sales tax. It has leaped in front of Australian Labor. Botswana is light years in front of Australian Labor. When at that table the OECD representatives, France, Germany and all of the Europeans and Japan and all of the Asians, support value added tax. If the Australian Labor Party had its way it would say that France is wrong, Germany is wrong, Belgium is wrong and Spain is wrong. The only people who really understand tax in this world are in the government of Swaziland or lead the Labor Party. They are the only people. This is a political movement light years behind Botswana. The Australian Labor Party is hanging out as the last political movement in the world on wholesale sales tax. You have Moody's, the IMF, the OECD and the developed countries of the world. This is tax reform that is good for Australia, it is tax reform that will bring us into the modern age and we would expect nothing less from the Australian Labor Party than to oppose it.</DOC>

 - I have obtained advice on this matter and I am informed by my department and by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that the funding for National Textiles was approved under the national projects element of the RAP program, which is separate from the main element of the program. I have been further informed that the National Textiles payment was not the first time that the national projects element of RAP had been used to respond to regional emergencies. Funding was provided for the retraining of former employees of Oakdale Colliery following its closure last year and also in response to the damage to the local economy caused by Cyclone Rosita earlier this year. The truth of this matter is that that payment was made in circumstances that are well known. I am very proud of the fact that the coalition government assisted the workers of the Hunter. - Mr Speaker, I was asked whether there had been other uses of this particular stream. There have been. They were used on those occasions to help battling Australians. The bottom line of this little exercise is that, once again, the Labor Party is against helping Australian workers. - Yes.</DOC>

Obviously, being the former Minister for Trade and former Deputy Prime Minister, he understands a lot of the history of this particular WTO case that we have been defending with regard to Howe Leather.

We cannot underestimate the significance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to this and avoiding the possibility of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of retaliation that may have been levelled at Australia's wine industry or beef industry, as the member indicated in his question. The US is our second largest export market and is worth about $13 billion annually. It includes exports such as $275 million dollars worth of wine, $42 million worth of citrus, $1 billion worth of meat products, including over $100 million worth of lamb, as well as $700 million in autos and auto components. These are all areas that could have been exposed to retaliation had we not been as diligent as we have been in negotiating this outcome.Importantly, as a result of the negotiated settlement, we have helped to safeguard 700 jobs with the Howe company. Interestingly, 120 of those jobs are at Rosedale in regional Victoria, which I think is in the seat of the member for Gippsland, and I am sure that he is very appreciative of that. Also, just as importantly, 350 of those jobs are at the Thomastown factory on the outskirts of Melbourne, which I understand is in the seat of Scullin, and I am sure that the member for Scullin is also very pleased about this very important outcome.Members will recall that the decision in the WTO required a payment of $30 million by Howe Leather. The settlement that we have negotiated with the United States administration involves Howe paying just $7.2 million over 12 years as well as an agreement that automotive leather be removed from eligibility for support under the TCF and motor vehicle plans. This is a very significant outcome in terms of trade negotiations on the international scene. It has been a significant test of the ability of our officials and this government in terms of reaching an outcome that avoids serious retaliation that could have had a major impact on a number of Australia's very important export industries. We have kept our heads down in recent months while we were working away with our counterparts in the US. Unfortunately, the Labor Party's trade spokesman, Senator Cook, has been out doing a bit of scaremongering and frightening of industries, trying to whip them up into a bit of a frenzy. -  - It is a fact, he has. He has been out frightening people - the usual Labor Party tactic in every single activity that they undertake. Instead of being a little bit constructive, as he is in a lot of areas, he has been very unhelpful by trying to frighten those industries that we have been trying to protect. That is the usual manner of the Labor Party. This result underpins the importance of the government's policy and focus on improving the rules and disciplines within the WTO, improving and strengthening our advocacy in the WTO, so that we can run a successful case, as we have with Howe Leather, and get a successful outcome that secures jobs and protects other industries from retaliation. We certainly hope that the Leader of the Opposition is up to the challenge in Hobart when he confronts the ACTU leadership on terms of trade policy. That will be a very interesting challenge for the Leader of the Opposition. At the end of the day, this government has delivered in terms of industries that were threatened with retaliation and in getting a satisfactory outcome for Howe Leather in this case. </DOC>

 - It is true that there was no money paid in this way while you were in government, because you did not have an entitlements scheme. - Is it silly to look after workers? That is silly, is it?  - As the House knows, and as increasing numbers of Australian workers know, the first government to introduce an employee entitlements scheme was the Howard government. We had 13 Keating and Hawke years, and not one dollar was paid to look after the workers' entitlements.  - I would remind the House that it was not only the coalition government that assisted the workers in the National Textiles case. On that occasion we were joined by the Carr Labor government of New South Wales. But when we decided to help the meatworkers of Scone, where were Kim Beazley and Bob Carr? They left them stone motherless broke and alone.  - It is true that the workers at Scone did not get 100 per cent, because Carr gave them nothing. That is the reason. Where is the help in Scone? </DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and for his interest in the government's foreign policies, in particular our involvement with the United Nations. It has been drawn to my attention that members of the opposition, particularly our old friend the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford Smith, and a couple of journalists have been suggesting that Australia has apparently no great interest these days in the United Nations. Let me first of all dispense with that particular canard. This is a government that have a very great interest in and a very great focus on the United Nations. In particular, we have a very clear sense of priorities in terms of the sort of work we should be doing usefully with the United Nations. After all, it was this government that ran Gareth Evans for the position of Secretary-General of UNESCO - and the Labor Party turn around and say that we do not care about the United Nations. That says something for the respect they had for our candidate. We thought he was a good candidate, so don't you trash Gareth. You know what the Labor Party are like behind everyone's back.The government's performance with the United Nations is in many respects outstanding. Very few people, except in the Labor Party, will have forgotten that it was this government that brought about the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996 through the United Nations General Assembly. We saved the CTBT from the UN Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, where it was about to die. We revived it and brought it to life through the General Assembly. Then they turn around and say we do not care about the United Nations. I would have thought that was a little silly. We worked very closely with the United Nations throughout last year on the East Timor issue. We worked, I thought, very successfully during the course of this year with the United Nations on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference, which had a very good outcome, if I may say so. The opposition's argument here revolves around a trivial point that apparently appeals to trivial minds - that we are not sending a minister to the World Summit for Social Development Plus 5 meeting, which is a review conference of the World Summit for Social Development. Instead, our ambassador in Geneva, Les Luck, is to lead our delegation. I would have thought Mr Luck would do an extremely good job. The fact is that during the week when this review conference is taking place parliament will be sitting and ministers will be available to answer questions from the opposition through that week. This is a review conference and it is the government's view that the review of what is an array of worthy aspirations in the declaration of the Copenhagen summit is something that can be extremely ably handled by our ambassador and our senior officials. - That may well be so. Therefore, why is it that you argue a minister should go? How silly the Labor Party is. The Labor Party has been running the line that apparently there have been enormous objections to the government not sending a minister and there have been representations to my very office that we are not sending a minister. I can confirm that there have been at least two representations to my office, both of them from the ACTU. One of those representations was from Bill Mansfield of the ACTU, who is, what - the Assistant Secretary of the ACTU? - As the Treasurer said, he wants the trip. The ACTU wanted to join the Australian delegation.  - Greg Combet and Bill Mansfield wrote to me, but Jennie George never did. Jennie George never thought it was important enough to make representations to me. I can see the member for Throsby taking an interest in what I am saying now - yes, because she was chasing your seat at that time. Let me be square with the House: we have had other representations. When Senator Newman was recently in New York at the United Nations conference she was approached by a United Nations official and she was lobbied by him on this very question of Australia not sending a minister to the Copenhagen Plus 5 meeting. Who was that official? The House will be interested to know that it was none other than John Langmore, the former Labor member for Fraser - a man whom you all, no doubt, hold in the highest regard. Or do you? I am sure honourable members opposite will remember that their former leader, Mr Paul Keating, described John Langmore as a gigantic fool. This is the basis of your argument. In conclusion, the Labor Party says it is very concerned about the United Nations and that we should be more active in the United Nations. That is your line, is it not - that we should be even more active than we are? I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition in November of last year, requesting him to nominate a replacement for Gareth Evans on the Australian National Commission for UNESCO. I wrote in November last year and I have not had a reply. You care so much about the UN that you have not bothered to put anyone forward for that position. That is how much you care.</DOC>

 - Not only has the government modelled the price effects of the new tax system on all of those different families at 10 deciles of different income level but that has also been done by private forecasters. All of those analyses show that, in every decile, after price rises taken in their totality the dual income family is better off under the new tax system. This argument has now been going on for two years, and the Labor Party has yet to produce any model on any decile of any of those structures which is worse off as a consequence. In the last 24 hours we have been discussing the Murphy modelling. That arose because the Labor Party says that it wants input taxation on caravan parks. That has been the essence of your demonstrations at Tweed Heads with your fellow members of the Labor Party nicely pictured in the Sydney Morning Herald the other day. The Murphy model actually showed that, if you have your way and if the concessional rate of the GST with input tax credits were abolished, which is your policy, over the longer term residents of caravan parks could be worse off, with double the price increase. But you can trip yourself up on all this. Mr Beazley was doing an interview - I think it was on Western Australian radio - on this very point and the interviewer posed that question to him. And, remember, this is the Murphy modelling.  - Murphy is the modeller: m-u-r-p-h-y. We have had this argument about the Murphy modelling for the last 48 hours. The interviewer asked:The modelling suggests that some tenants might be better off in boarding houses if the GST stays and they get back the input tax credit. Wouldn't you be removing that option by rolling back the GST on boarding houses?Mr Beazley answered:Oh, you know, models are always arguable. So here we are - `models are always arguable'. So here we have the Murphy modelling, which actually comes out and not only proves that the options are equivalent in the short term but shows that a half GST with full input tax credit over the longer term is a better option. And the Labor Party heroically rides out and says, `Notwithstanding that, we'd like to take that option out even though it would make caravan park owners worse off over the long term - that is our policy. We want to make sure they're treated the same as residential rents, even if that works out worse.' That was the position that you confirmed on radio this morning. It was the position that you are going to move in the Senate to take away an option which, on the basis of the Murphy modelling, over the longer term would actually be an improvement. Our case rests.</DOC>

 - I can report to the honourable member for Corangamite and indeed the House that there is a great deal of support in the dairy industry for the federal government's $1.78 billion package to assist the dairy industry to go through this restructuring phase. The states are, one by one, passing legislation to deregulate their dairy industry. Legislation has already been passed in the Victorian parliament and I understand also in the parliaments of South Australia and Tasmania. It is currently being debated in New South Wales and will certainly be considered in Queensland and Western Australia very soon. I am receiving a lot of letters from dairy farmers, even those who are concerned about deregulation, expressing very strong support for the federal government's package. By way of a couple of examples, I received a letter from a farmer in Beaudesert in Queensland, one of those areas that will be significantly affected by deregulation, saying: I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your concern and support for the Queensland dairy industry during this period of uncertainty leading up to deregulation.A farmer in New South Wales wrote to say:We are a family operation and our 29-year-old son, who is a fourth generation dairy farmer, is very keen to carry on, and we feel that this can only be accomplished with the assistance of the package.So there is a great deal of evidence of very considerable support for the package being provided by the federal government, which will certainly assist dairy farmers through these difficult times. We have also, of course, faced some criticism over these matters particularly from certain Labor ministers - people like Minister Amery and Minister Palaszczuk - who have been trying to blame the federal government all along for dairy deregulation while at the same time they have been putting legislation through their own state parliaments. There is plenty of criticism and attempts to blame the federal government for their own state action. Indeed, we even had the honourable member for Paterson, who could not get an audience in the Labor Party for anyone interested in dairy issues, actually having to come to the National Party conference to hear anybody say anything about dairying at all. He was very quick again to point the blame and to try to suggest that, somehow or other, this was a coalition plot - although he did have to admit that it was Minister Amery that had put the legislation through the New South Wales parliament. This morning we actually had Ministers Palaszczuk and Amery on AM -  - Yes, supporting the federal government's package but pleading for the National Party and the Liberal Party to put politics aside so this could be pushed through the New South Wales and the Queensland parliaments. Henry Palaszczuk had this to say, and this is the man who has been blaming the federal government for deregulation all along:I believe that dairy deregulation in Australia is inevitable, especially here in Queensland.So Henry Palaszczuk wants it in Queensland, and Richard Amery went even further:I think it is up to the National Party really to put their politics aside for at least the next few days to get this legislation through the Upper House.The hypocrisy of Labor! Who can guess what they will say next - the people now appealing for the National Party to fall in behind the Labor Party so this legislation can get through. Over the last few days I have been getting quite a lot of mail on a range of issues, including quite a lot of letters on a campaign called `Enough is enough' about capital gains tax on superannuation funds, if you please. I have been getting quite a lot of these letters. I was going through a little pile of them this morning and I just happened to accidentally turn one over and - lo and behold - it is on the paper of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition.Government members - Oh! - This is legislation that was actually voted for and supported by the Labor Party, and now they are arranging a campaign, on the paper of the Leader of the Opposition, to get people to write in to complain. Isn't that typical of Labor? Whose side are they actually on? Do they want dairy deregulation or do they not? If they do, they should get on with it so that dairy farmers have the capacity to access the Commonwealth government's package and get on with building a successful and prosperous dairy industry for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. On 6 June the Therapeutic Goods Administration issued a hazard alert in relation to the St Jude Tempo class of pacemakers. We had received reports from clinicians that these pacemakers might be subject to premature failure. Unfortunately, with complex medical devices you cannot always pick up problems during the manufacture process and some 50 per cent of problems only become evident once the device is in situ. There are 22,000 of those pacemakers in use worldwide, we estimate about 1,100 of them in Australia. The failure rate at the moment is not high. There have been 58 failures notified worldwide, about one in every 400. No person has died. But we would expect three people in Australia to be subject to this, and because of this the Therapeutic Goods Administration issued its hazard alert and the recall. As a response to this there have been calls by the Plaintiff Lawyers Association for further action, and the shadow minister for health made comments on Melbourne radio on Monday morning about this recall. She described it as appallingly handled and said we had no register for those who have the devices and no systematic way of registering the problems and then making sure the recall happens as soon as the problems have been identified. I was concerned about this. I called the Therapeutic Goods Administration in last night and spent an hour and a half with them discussing the matters. The mechanism that the shadow minister appears to be advocating is the one that is used in the United States - the only country in the world, I might say, to have a mandatory registration system. I asked my department overnight to check with the FDA in the United States as to what percentage of pacemakers they managed to register with their mandatory system. The answer we got back was that 36 to 40 per cent of pacemakers are registered under this system. By contrast, Australia's voluntary system of registration gets 98 per cent of pacemakers, which the TGA informs me is believed to be the best in the world. So the mandatory system that the opposition spokesperson is advocating gets less than half the outcome we get from the current Australian system. Secondly, she said there is no systematic way of registering problems. There is a difficulty here, and as she has to actually deal with legislation a bit further on in her career she will understand that the Commonwealth has no constitutional head of power to compel doctors' behaviour. We cannot make legislation in this effect, unlike the USA, which does have the constitutional power. So to have a doctor compulsorily complying with a register is not something the Commonwealth can compel anyone to do. The second point I would make here is that in fact we maintain a device incident and reporting investigation scheme, which was exactly the manner in which this came up. - The shadow minister makes the point that we have no way of ensuring that the recall happens as soon as problems is identified. I can hear her bleating out opposite that the system has failed. I asked the Therapeutic Goods Administration how this recall compared to other countries in the world, and they tell me that Australia was the first country in the world to issue a recall for this product. The fact is that, even more than two weeks later, the United States has still not issued a recall. So, far from being a failure, we actually have the most effective system in the world and one that you are going out and scaremongering about at a time when we should be having some calm. This is rank political opportunism based on ignorance and misinformation. It is at a time when people should be trying to reassure the public. Australia actually has had the first recall in the entire world. No other country has done as well as us, and your political opportunism holds you absolutely condemned and incompetent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. It is appropriate, it now being a bare nine days before the commencement of the greatest tax reform of Australia's history, that I inform the House of the numerous steps that have been taken to assist the business community of Australia to get ready for this marvellous change to Australia's taxation system. The GST Start-up Office has been working with peak business organisations to provide around 12,500 seminars and workshops right across Australia. A help line has been funded to ensure that advice is available on business management skills. Direct assistance vouchers of $200 have been sent to eligible businesses to help with start-up costs. This is complemented by immediate tax deductibility for expenditure incurred in businesses getting GST ready. The start-up office, again in close consultation with industry, has produced a range of products to help business prepare, including the business skills guide, the voluntary sector guide, repricing guidelines to assist with pricing issues and much more. The Australian Taxation Office has also been highly active in making sure that businesses have the information they need to prepare for the GST. Some 2.7 million applications for ABNs have been lodged. The commissioner has guaranteed that anyone who lodged an application for an ABN before 31 May will have their ABN by 1 July, when the new system begins. Over 2.3 million calls have been made to the tax reform infolines and business has sought and received over 12 million publications, booklets and fact sheets. There have been over 90 million hits to the ATO's tax reform web site. There have been 150,000 requests for advisory visits by the ATO, and 86 per cent of those advisory visits have been completed as I speak. There have been over 56,000 pieces of correspondence, and over 200,000 people have attended key seminars at 120 locations around Australia, with 50,000 attending ATO Sky Channel seminars at 800 locations. The Morgan and Banks survey last month indicated that 94 per cent of businesses were GST ready. Dun and Bradstreet had a similar finding: 75 per cent said that the GST was no major disruption to their businesses. ATO research last month found that 86 per cent of businesses were close to being ready and over 95 per cent were aware of tax reform initiatives, et cetera.Those figures indicate a pattern of commitment, interest and compliance by the Australian business community, and I congratulate the Australian business community, I congratulate the Australian Taxation Office and I congratulate everybody associated with the positive effort to get this country ready for the greatest tax reform that it has ever seen. In the face of that, having congratulated all those groups, I condemn the Australian Labor Party for having done everything in its power to destroy an initiative that is designed to strengthen the Australian economy. I think what I have told the House represents the determination of ordinary Australians to triumph in the face of the destructive approach of the Australian Labor Party. At every turn the Liberal and National parties have sought to do the right thing for Australia. At every turn the Australian Labor Party has sought to sow confusion, doubt and fear in the Australian community. I believe that the Australian people will know that the Australian Labor Party has attempted to destroy an initiative which is designed to help the Australian community and the Australian people. I have never pretended that tax reform is easy, I have never pretended that it is not without complexity, but I have always argued that it is good for Australia. I believe that the great majority of the Australian people will share that judgment in the weeks and months that follow 1 July and, in sharing that judgment, they will remember with contempt the destructive contribution of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The only person in this House who should resign is the member for Grayndler. Aided and abetted by the member for Lilley, the member for Grayndler has deliberately and in a calculated way gone around the eastern seaboard of Australia and put a lot of fear and scare into some of the most vulnerable people in this community, even to the stage where he is starting to masquerade as a tenant. It was quite obvious in a photograph in the Sydney Morning Herald recently, where I recognised many faces of locals. There are also many other faces in that photograph. There is an ALP member of the upper house. There are two ALP preselection candidates and one of the member for Grayndler's ex-staffers. And there in the middle of the photograph I see a face that looks remarkably like the member for Grayndler and also Wayne Swan - how extraordinary! We know you are totally hypocritical on this issue. The new measures which were brought in this week by the coalition - particularly concerning the ACCC and the New Tax Advisory Board - will ensure that there is no price discrimination. The fear that has been planted in these people's minds has come from you. The announcement today - a very good announcement - that the maximum rate of rent assistance would go up by 10 per cent means an additional $33 million will benefit people right around this country including people in boarding houses in your electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. It is particularly timely in view of the contribution just a short time ago by that well known Tweed Heads van dweller, the member for Grayndler. Firstly, let me indicate that the current law provides a choice for caravan parks and boarding houses to have rent input                       taxed or subject to GST on a reduced cost base. This allows accommodation proprietors to choose between the option which has the least impact on rent and provides tenants with the capability to put pressure on proprietors to achieve the lowest rent outcome. A number of propositions have been bandied about in the past week. The proposition has been put to the government that caravan park and boarding house residents deserve special attention. I commend my colleague the Minister for Community Services for consulting with a number of those genuine caravan park residents over recent days on this very question. We know that Labor proposes to remove the choice of tax treatment. Labor proposes to remove an option which would allow caravan park owners the opportunity to minimise their tax burden. By denying caravan park owners the option of claiming back the GST that they have paid on their inputs, park owners would have no choice but to pass on their costs in the form of higher rents. You wonder just where they come from at times.What we have seen in their discussions on this over the past week is the first concrete item of roll-back of the GST. What is the outcome of roll-back as proposed by the Labor Party? It amounts to roll-forward - dearer costs for residents of caravan parks and boarding houses. You want to make them worse off and that is what you mean by roll-back. If you want to get some insight into where this comes from, you only have to take note of what the Leader of the Opposition said in a doorstop interview this morning. He made this extraordinary claim: Compensation packages come and go. I've been a finance minister. I know what happens to compensation packages five or six years down the track. You can forget them.What an extraordinary comment. It is almost breathtaking in its honesty. Since 1993 we have been wondering what Labor meant about compensation. Do you remember 1993? There were l-a-w tax cuts. What did we get in Australia? We got wholesale sales tax that went up from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, with no compensation. It went up from 20 per cent to 22 per cent, from 30 per cent to 32 per cent and from 43 per cent to 45 per cent - with no compensation. It took about five days for that compensation of tax cuts to disappear. Do not worry about your five or six years; you have told the Australian people that if they ever put Labor in charge of the Treasury bench again, they should not take any notice of any promise they make when it comes to compensation.There is another policy that has been put forward on this question. The Democrats wanted to lower the cost base from the existing 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The government's view is that if you want to target assistance for a particular group in the community, you do not introduce complexities into the taxation system; you target assistance to the group in question. That is why today the government has announced an increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance from seven per cent to 10 per cent, taking effect from 1 July. This is $33 billion in additional rent assistance to a genuinely disadvantaged sector of the community. It is an indication that this government will listen, consult and respond to those who need assistance when it becomes appropriate.</DOC>

 - We all know in this House that you cannot rely on information supplied by the Australian Labor Party. What we are doing from 1 July is providing $100 million worth of rental assistance, of which an extra $33 million has been announced today. For those on the maximum rate that means it is going up from $5.40 to $7.70 for singles and from $5 to $7.25 for couples per fortnight. Let us not forget that these people on low incomes not only receive a four per cent increase in their pension, not only get a 2.5 per cent increase in their assets test and not only benefit, as do many families benefit, from the $2.4 billion in family assistance - huge tax reductions -  - They are lucky they have a coalition government in power because we are helping them and we are delivering to them. These are large tax cuts we are providing, where 80 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 30 per cent income tax, not to mention the savings bonuses and supplementary bonuses. These are real things that we put into place. As the Minister for Finance and Administration just mentioned, you never had any compensation measures when interest rates in this country, under your stewardship, went to 18 per cent or 19 per cent -  - They went to 23 per cent, and there was no compensation whatsoever. There was no compensation when there were increases in wholesale sales taxes. The fact is that people in those areas receiving rental assistance will be substantially better off, and that is because this is a responsive and caring government. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and for the interest that he shows in this important issue. Since my visit with a Commonwealth ministerial delegation to Honiara on 10 and 11 June there have been some positive developments, although the situation still remains very uncertain as the parties approach the scheduled sitting of the parliament on 28 June, next Wednesday. A truce was established for that visit by the Commonwealth ministers and that has held up. But, of course, the economy in the Solomon Islands is in crisis and the situation in Honiara is still tense. My special envoy, Mr Peter Baxter, and also our High Commissioner, Dr Martin Sharp, have been working intensively to promote negotiation amongst the key players. Our work has helped to bring together two important meetings over the past two days which have added momentum to the process of political settlement. The meetings have been between militant spokesmen Nori and Tabani on Wednesday and yesterday between the premiers and delegations of the two provinces directly concerned. These meetings have been chaired by local church figures and have taken place on Australian landing craft. A further meeting, including with the operational commanders of the militant groups, is now planned for Sunday on board HMAS Tobruk, which by then will have returned to Honiara.I am concerned to support those negotiations because we do need to achieve in the Solomons a lasting internal settlement to the ethnic conflict. As a result, I will be visiting Honiara on Saturday for further consultation with political and militant leaders. During my visit I will reinforce the need to consolidate the present de facto cease-fire and the need for an urgent return to constitutional and democratic rule, and renew our offer of substantial support, provided there is a clear commitment and active participation by the key internal parties in a renewed peace process. Australia's concern also remains for the people affected by this conflict. I remind the House that I announced earlier this week emergency humanitarian assistance to the value of $1 million to be delivered in Honiara in conjunction with the International Committee of the Red Cross for medical supplies, shelter and food.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of a question is no. The answer to the second, more general, part of the question has already been given in substance, as I think the member for Melbourne Ports would know, by the Treasurer during I thought a very good interview on the AM program yesterday in which he explained in some detail how -  -  - Let me go through it again. There has been some reference to the 4.7 that was contained in the Econtech report which was written by Mr Murphy, who is frequently described as a `modeller of choice'. He is obviously a choice of the Labor Party, because they refer to him very frequently. - We both refer to him frequently. Because he is a choice of the Labor Party, let us for the purposes of this discussion have a look at what he said. It bears very heavily on the central issue in this whole debate; that is, whether you are better or worse off being input taxed or paying a half GST. What Murphy says is that in the long run if you take the Labor Party option you are much worse off.  - It is very interesting that just before question time the member for Lilley - and I will come back to the 2.3 in a minute - held forth at a news conference and he gave, as the acting Treasurer said, the first really clear-cut commitment to a roll-back from the Australian Labor Party. He did not say it was a `roll-back'. He said it was an `ironclad guarantee'. We on this side of the House would like to know whether an ironclad guarantee is as good as l-a-w law. We would like to know whether that is as good. The reality is the member for Lilley was promising in Labor Party language to the occupiers of caravan parks and boarding houses that he would give them an ironclad guarantee they would be worse off because he was going to take away the option of the imposition of a half GST.Returning to what the member for Melbourne Ports asked me, about the 2.3 per cent, you will recall the Treasurer pointing out during that interview that that projection was based upon the GST proposal taken to the people at the last election. You will also be aware that the GST has been made more complicated than we would have liked because of the refusal of the opposition parties including your own to pass the GST that the Australian people had supported at the election. As a result of that, that 2.3 figure was varied to something of the order of 3.5. When you take in the margins for land that the Treasurer spoke about you find effectively something of the order of an 80c difference in a $200 a week rental. While I do not know the detail of the gentleman's position, I would be very happy as I always am to have that analysed. As to the general question you have put to me - it has no substance at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in this matter. Lifetime Health Cover is exceeding all expectations. We really are having a rush for cover and we are having reports back from the health funds that more people than had been expected are taking advantage of the Friday-week cut-off. This is very good news. A big influx of younger, fitter people into private health cover will stabilise it, will keep premiums down and will give Australians real choice. I got some very good feedback this morning on radio station 2GB when the former Labor Party health minister Graham Richardson said:By the way, Lifetime Health Cover is a very good policy. I strongly support this move. It is a beauty and it is having its effect.That is always welcome from someone who actually understands health policy as a former health minister. He also went on to solve a riddle that has been plaguing me for some time. I could not quite understand why when it comes to heath care the Labor Party is locked in the 1950s with a Stalinist model of health care provision. But Graham Richardson on 2GB this morning also explained this. In his words:Jenny Macklin has an ideological position with which I don't agree, and that is that she doesn't like private health insurance.This explains the actions of the Labor Party over the last 18 months. But it poses a problem for federal Labor because 77 per cent of the Australian population actually want a mixed provision of public and private health cover. They do not want the system that happened under 13 years of Labor where private health care was allowed to slowly wither away, premiums escalated to an extraordinary extent and benefits continually shrank. The Labor Party in the end has to decide whether they are prepared to allow a mixed public-private provision, as we have in public broadcasting, as we have in education and as we have in health. It works well. It is the Australian way. It has the strong support of the Australian population.</DOC>

 - The government has been monitoring closely the question of petrol - the strike rate on the excise, et cetera. One of the factors that clearly cannot be ignored is the meeting overnight in Vienna of the OPEC oil ministers. That has been considered by the government and the government will be making an announcement on this issue -  - later this afternoon. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. The Queensland government first passed legislation to introduce alternative state provisions in 1998. This legislation was significantly flawed and had to be significantly rewritten. It passed workable legislation in July last year. Subsequently the Queensland government requested that I make some 13 different determinations under the Native Title Act in relation to those alternative state provisions. But after careful study, and in accordance with my statutory obligations, I determined that the Queensland provisions did comply with the Native Title Act requirements. The determinations were tabled in this House on 1 June and they were tabled in the Senate on 5 June. Those determinations are important because they enable the integration of some native title processes into the land management and mining regimes in Queensland. Those affected by native title, whether as claimants or resource developers or landowners, have the opportunity in that respect of more certain administration. However, on 8 June the Democrats moved a motion in the Senate to disallow my determinations and, therefore, in effect the Queensland legislation. In a news release of that day, Senator Woodley said: The Democrats call on the Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, to vote consistently with Labor's opposition to the NT's native title regime which presented the same issues as the Queensland legislation. Labor must not side with the Howard government against indigenous people. I call on Kim Beazley to examine his conscience and do the right thing by the indigenous people of Queensland. Not surprisingly, Mr Beattie, the Queensland Labor Premier, has a different view. He has called for all senators to support Queensland's historic native title legislation. He said: This is a fair and balanced model which should be followed by other states. It should become the model for Australia. If the Senate rejects our model, everyone loses. Mining exploration will disappear offshore and indigenous communities will miss out. The Australian people, and Queenslanders in particular, want to know whether Labor intends to support Mr Beattie in the Senate. Or is Labor intending to reopen a divisive debate on native title? The Labor spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks, was quoted on this subject in the Courier Mail of 2 June. He said: Aboriginal affairs spokesman, Daryl Melham, last night would not commit the opposition to supporting the laws, saying Labor caucus was yet to decide. `We will be consulting with the relevant parties and the Caucus will form a view at an appropriate time.'  What is an appropriate time? There have been caucus meetings since that statement was made and there will be another one next week. Are we going to hear soon what Queensland native title claimants and resource developers want to hear? It seems not. Labor, in disregard of the interests of those affected in Queensland, has made a deal with the Democrats not to deal with this issue until parliament resumes after the winter break.  - An appropriate time, Mr Speaker. It has nothing do with the interests of either indigenous claimants or the resource based interests. Queenslanders deserve better. Labor knocked back the native title regime in the Northern Territory but Labor allowed determinations relating to two areas in New South Wales in the Lightning Ridge region. They passed through parliament without being disallowed. If Labor truly believed that the provisions of the Native Title Act relating to alternative state and territory regimes were racially discriminatory they should have moved to disallow those determinations, but they did not. Perhaps there is one policy for coalition governments and another policy for Labor mates, but what is the policy for Queensland? There are some members from Queensland over there. There is the member for Brisbane, there is the member for Bowman, there is the member for Capricornia, there is the member for Oxley, there is the member for Griffith, and there is the member for Rankin. They should get behind the Leader of the Opposition, give him a push and make Labor decide now what Queenslanders want to know. </DOC>

I clearly indicated that the government will be informing everyone later this afternoon.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this matter. In a very recent article in the prestigious journal The Annals of Internal Medicine the cost of just hangovers in Australia was put at over $6.3 billion a year from lost productivity and illness. That is a very significant amount. In the 1998 household expenditure survey, 18 per cent of people admitted to having driven a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The survey also showed that 30 per cent of people 14 years of age or older had been subject to verbal abuse by people who had been drunk; five per cent of people 14 years of age or older admitted to being subject to physical abuse from people who had been drunk. Beyond these immediate harms, there are much longer-term health costs of disease, premature death and substantial risk-taking behaviour.The Commonwealth has a number of strategies where we are trying to address the issue of alcohol related harm in the community. There is a national alcohol action plan under way. We hope to complete it later this year. It is providing direction on a number of issues, particularly health and hospitality work force education and training, workplace alcohol policies and education, the needs of high-risk communities and populations, and the need for interventions to reduce alcohol related harm. Further, earlier this year, we launched two very successful commercials aimed at binge drinking amongst younger people to raise the awareness of choices in safe drinking. The National Health and Medical Research Council is releasing safe drinking guidelines. They are being prepared, and in fact this weekend will be sent out for further public consultation. The second part of the honourable member's question was: are all governments acting to promote these initiatives? I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Western Australian, South Australian, Victorian and Tasmanian governments have been particularly responsible in this area. One of the most significant things that has happened in recent years - and I am actually prepared to give the opposition credit for something when they were in government - is the introduction of a differential rate on the taxation of beer. This was introduced in the 1988 budget. I remember it well because it was in the first days in this new Parliament House. In the budget night speech in 1988, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said very clearly that the reform was designed to favour the consumption of lower alcohol beverages. The health minister, Neal Blewett, the following day in answer to questions expanded on this. He said:... I regard it as a major advance in the taxation system of this country to establish for all time a taxation regime which distinguishes between low and high alcohol beer. I believe that now it is established and built into the system it will be maintained, and I believe that that has very positive health benefits.In answer to another question on this matter, he went on to say:... they will lead to a swing away from both the consumption and production of higher strength alcohol beers ....The research has in fact borne this out. The drug and alcohol review in 1995, looking at Australia's harm minimisation policies, stated:A reasonable assumption is that the observed downturn in the per capita consumption of alcohol in Australia has been contributed to by the introduction of differential strength beers and that to some degree the reduction in alcohol related morbidity and mortality in Australia can be similarly attributed.So it has been very successful. For that reason it is immensely disappointing that the New South Wales government have announced that from 1 July they are in fact no longer going to subsidise low alcohol beer. This initiative, in place for over 12 years, has had very positive health effects for Australia on what is the second biggest preventable cause of illness in Australia. So while the Commonwealth government are working hard in this area, we cannot do things alone. We need to work cooperatively with state and territory governments. Most states are meeting their needs and their obligations in this public health area. New South Wales are not.</DOC>

 - May I reply to the honourable member for Blaxland. The Treasurer has gone to Paris to chair the ministerial committee of the OECD. I think that reflects well not only on the Treasurer but also on Australia. This rather juvenile attitude being taken by the Labor Party was not of course taken by the Labor Party in relation to such responsibilities when they occupied the treasury bench. There has been absolutely no interruption as a result of the Treasurer departing overseas today. There has been no interruption at all to the processes of administration in relation to the matters raised by the honourable member for Blaxland. The Acting Treasurer will be making a detailed announcement later today, and all of your interests will be met. The Australian motorist, I believe, will be well and happily pleased with the response. I think it was only right that the government take into account the deliberations of the OPEC countries -   - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. - The same observation applies, Mr Speaker. You will hear further about that - whether that is immediately after question time, I am not quite sure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his involvement particularly in the agricultural sector in his electorate. Australia's agricultural exporters are urging the government on a daily basis to continue its policy of pursuing better market access for all our exports across the world, and our active involvement in the World Trade Organisation is at the centre of that policy setting. You would also be aware, Mr Speaker, that, because of that involvement and our use of the rules based system in the World Trade Organisation, we got that very good outcome that I announced yesterday with regard to the long-running dispute with the American government about Howe Leather which, as a side benefit, is also going to secure a stable future for exports for Australia's wine industry.Within the pursuit of those goals, the main game of pursuing better market access and fairer market access for Australia's exports is within the multilateral trading system within the WTO. That is the core focus of what we are trying to do. Getting a new round of trade investigations launched within the WTO provides the best opportunity to do just that: to get better market access broadly across all markets into which we export. Within that context we are also active in regional bodies such as APEC, for which I recently chaired a very successful meeting in Darwin. We are also pursuing discussions with our regional partners on free trade agreements that may provide better market access for Australia's exports into those markets, but it is all within the architecture of the multilateral system within the World Trade Organisation.Of course, we should have been well down the path to achieving this now. We should have had the launch of a new round of trade negotiations out of Seattle last year, but we did not. Seattle failed last year because the agenda was overloaded with issues like labour standards, which the US administration was very anxious to have on the agenda. We now have a debate taking place in Australia about the same thing. The ACTU and its leading luminaries, Sharan Burrow and Doug Cameron, want to kill off a new round before we can even get it started by overloading the agenda with issues such as labour standards. I would like to quote from an article in the Financial Review today that is headed `Trade policy would put Australia offside'. The leading paragraph says:The Labor Party's proposed approach to trade and labour standards, if implemented, would put Australia offside with the vast majority of World Trade Organisation members on the issue. - I am coming to him. The interesting thing on this issue is that there are two very strong points of view within the labour movement. There is the spokesman for trade issues within the Labor Party and there is the ACTU. We are going to have this interesting debate. Senator Cook is looking for a bit of support from some of the frontbenchers opposite. Further on in the same article it says:The head of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Mr Cameron, has advocated the imposition of 'social tariffs' on countries not meeting minimum labour standards.That is what he is advocating, that is what he and Sharan Burrow are pushing to the national conference of the ALP. In the same article, and it is to Senator Cook's credit, it said: At the weekend, Labor's trade spokesman Senator Peter Cook rejected the use of either sanctions or social tariffs.I know that Senator Cook has some supporters on the front bench over there, but the test is going to come as to whether the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to support him. I know that after our trade ministerial council meeting in Brisbane last Friday Sandra Norrie, from New South Wales, may support him as well. The question is: will the Leader of the Opposition? In his address to the New South Wales Labor conference the Leader of the Opposition said:Australia is a stronger country in part because of our greater integration into the world economy. Thirty years ago, Australia's exports stood at just over 10 per cent of GDP. Today, our annual exports of over $114 billion amount to about 20 per cent of national output. It's a much bigger cake, and exports have a much bigger share of it.All this shows us there's no sense in closing ourselves off from the world ...And he is right. That was lifted out of a speech that I made at the National Press Club, and I will quote from that speech:We are stronger now, in part, because we are more integrated into the world economy. In 1970, Australia's exports stood at just over 10 per cent of GDP. Today, our annual exports of over $114 billion amount to about 20 per cent of GDP.So the Leader of the Opposition is agreeing with what I said at the Press Club but he is not agreeing with the ACTU. So the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Cook, Mr McMullan and Sandra Norrie from New South Wales are going to have to stand up to Sharan Burrow and Doug Cameron in Hobart and tell them what proper trade policy is all about.</DOC>

 - As we know, the government's tax reform is of enormous benefit to education and training providers in Australia. It will see the removal of Labor's tax on education - the wholesale sales tax - which imposes costs of some $240 million a year on education and training. I would have thought that the Labor Party would be welcoming the tax reforms rather than trying to stir up confusion about these reforms in the minds of those who will be benefiting from them. I understand that the Australian Taxation Office will be releasing the ruling shortly. There has been a need for consultation with peak bodies, state and Commonwealth departments and the Australian National Training Authority. The ruling will complement my determination on ACE courses under the GST legislation. If any provider is acting improperly in relation to the imposition of the GST, the facts of the case should be presented to me. But the fact is that the information issued by the government is out there now which provides guidance to providers about the imposition of the GST and which courses are GST free. The great bulk of education and training courses in Australia are GST free. The provision of education becomes much cheaper under the tax reform, and it will be of great benefit to all those seeking education and training in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The government's literacy and numeracy program, with its focus on bringing all young people up to national standard literacy outcomes at least, is the most important social justice policy in education at the present time. In fact, it addresses disadvantages which have remained unaddressed in this country for decades and which the Labor Party failed to address throughout its 13 years in office.  As part of that strategy, the government has developed, in close consultation with indigenous communities, the National Indigenous Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, which was launched by the Prime Minister on 9 March this year. The strategy has 16 ambassadors, including Evelyn Scott, Jimmy Little and Nicky Winmar, who are spokespeople for the strategy throughout Australia. All are achievers and role models who want to inspire young indigenous students to continue with their education. Today I received feedback on the visit to the Moree Croc Eisteddfod of another ambassador the for the strategy, League legend Cliff Lyons. Cliff publicised the strategy and stressed to the community the importance of staying on at school and building solid literacy skills. Cliff Lyons told the students at the Croc Eisteddfod:I am an ambassador for indigenous literacy and numeracy. I chose sport as my career path, and it has been a very rewarding one for me. What ever your career path, it is vital these days to have the skills to be able to move through life and be able to do what you want to do, and that means getting a good education. Kids, I say it is cool to be at school.This sort of message to young indigenous people from somebody like Cliff Lyons is invaluable. I want to say how grateful I am to Cliff and the other ambassadors for their assistance in getting this message across.Last week, I had the pleasure of announcing the winners in the inaugural excellence in leadership in indigenous education awards. The awards recognise excellence in four key areas: literacy, numeracy, attendance and school and community partnerships. The winning schools were Salisbury North R-7 School, Kununurra District High School, Wilcannia Central School and Katherine High School. These schools and their teachers are making a difference. They are getting children to school, engaging them and achieving results. This is where reconciliation is truly taking place - not through a divisive political agenda but in communities, amongst the people who are determined to make a difference. The Howard government is working closely with indigenous leaders, the indigenous literacy ambassadors in particular, and indigenous communities to make sure that young indigenous students get the equal educational opportunities to which they are entitled and which they did not get under the 13 years of the previous government.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to respond to the honourable member for Holt. As I am sure all members know, there has been some speculation recently in respect of a moratorium on the GST for housing. All of us would recognise the frustration felt by home buyers whose homes have not been completed as expected by 1 July. But buyers and home builders have known about the GST since 2 December 1998, so there has been plenty of time to make a decision in the context of construction being completed by 1 July 2000. If one would argue, as many would, that inclement weather in different parts of Australia - or, for that matter, a difficulty in getting tradesmen - may be present at this time, that is hardly unprecedented. It has been a factor in that industry for a long time. The simple fact is that home buyers do not have to pay GST on the full value of their partially completed houses because the government has put in place a margin system for property whereby only the value of the work done after 1 July 2000 is subject to GST.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. I think all members of the House would be aware that, at the moment, the Australian sugar industry is suffering from low commodity prices and difficult circumstances with climatic conditions and the like. In fact, just recently, our government announced some assistance for one of the key processing plants in North Queensland to assist with the crushing of the sugar crop there this year. It is important, particularly for the sugar industry, that we continue to argue the case internationally for an improvement in market access for products such as sugar. Australia produces 5.5 million tonnes of sugar and exports about 4.1 million tonnes of that production. So fairer market access is very critical for Australia's sugar industry. Following the failure to launch a round of multilateral trade negotiations in Seattle last year, we have begun the mandated agriculture negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. Next week the second committee session of those negotiations will begin. The Cairns Group of agricultural free trading countries, led by Australia, will be making its submission on some significant proposals with regard to market access. The key elements of that submission will be the elimination of export subsidies, tougher rules with regard to the use of export subsidies and domestic support and a call for a 50 per cent cut in subsidies in the first year of implementation.I would also, whilst responding to the member's question, like to acknowledge the great work that has been done by the Australian sugar industry generally in the last couple of years and, particularly in Seattle, in being a key player in the establishment of the global sugar alliance. The global sugar alliance is a group of sugar producing countries that are free-traders who are knocking on the doors of countries like the EU and the USA to get better access for their product and have a renewed focus with our efforts to target US and EU policies on sugar. It is interesting that the case is being focused on and has become far more compelling as there have been some reports from within the European Union and the US focusing on the distortionary impacts of the policies that are run there. A recent US General Accounting Office report has found that the sugar program in the US leads to a $3 billion cost on consumers in the US and results in the fact that, in the US, there are not too many soft drinks, like Coca-Cola, that actually have sugar in them, because sugar in the US is too expensive because of their policies.There are similar findings from the European Union's Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar which has criticised the huge costs on European consumers of the EU's sugar program. Both reports, which come from within those markets, support the global sugar alliance and the push that the Australian government is leading in the Cairns Group to see better and fairer market access for this very important Australian commodity. We export the overwhelming majority of what is produced, particularly from the member for Dawson's electorate.</DOC>

If any information is to be released about what advice has been sought and what advice has been given, it can only be done by the Australian Government Solicitor on the instructions of their client, in this case, I assume, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business or the department.

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I know the very strong support that she is giving to the schools - government and non-government - in her electorate, as are other members on the government benches. I know the member for Macquarie has a deep interest in this issue as well. The Howard government is making a major investment in government schools. It is an unprecedented commitment to recognising the right of every child to a quality education. Given that this is one of the issues about which the Labor Party and the Australian Education Union are waging a campaign of distortion and untruth, I have had my department look closely at the support that the Commonwealth is providing for government schools in the states governed by the Labor Party compared to the investment in those schools by the state governments. This analysis is very revealing. It shows that the Commonwealth investment in government schools in the Labor states is generally in excess of the investment that the state Labor governments are making. In terms of the rate of increase of that investment, Commonwealth investment in government schools is increasing more rapidly than the investment by the Labor Party governments in those states.  - In Tasmania, in its most recent budget, the Labor government increased investment in government schools by 2.9 per cent compared with a 4.3 per cent increase from the Commonwealth for Tasmanian government schools. In Queensland, under a Labor government, total school spending in the most recent budget rose by some 3.7 per cent compared with a Commonwealth increase of 7.5 per cent in that state. In Victoria the recent budget showed an increase of 4.5 per cent for schools while Commonwealth payments for that state increased by 6.6 per cent. The state which is at the bottom of the barrel is New South Wales. In the last budget New South Wales increased its spending on government schools by 1.9 per cent compared with an increase from the Commonwealth for government schools in New South Wales of 5.3 per cent. So this disgraceful campaign of untruth reveals that when the Labor Party gets into office its rhetoric is not matched by performance. In New South Wales we have a government which is simply not prepared to invest in public education. It is a government which is spending on a whole lot of other things, but it is not spending on government schools in New South Wales. The New South Wales government has failed public education in that state. The Commonwealth is the level of government which is making the effort to increase the quality of education, the resources of government schools, the literacy standards and the curriculum opportunities for students in those schools in New South Wales. The Howard government has an outstanding record of support for public education. It is the government which is driving improvements in public education at the moment. The Labor Party when it gets into office is not prepared to make the investments and the policies and to support the literacy test which students and parents have a right to expect.</DOC>

 - I will be saying a number of things in my address to the nation, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition - who will no doubt be given the opportunity to reply, if my understanding of the rules governing these things is accurate - to reply in whatever way he thinks fit. Let me take the opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has raised the issue of petrol pricing, to say a few things now.One of the things I find quite remarkable about the reaction of the oil companies is the astonishing way in which many of their spokesmen have dismissed the concept of any cost savings. Mr McMaster, the public affairs spokesman for British Petroleum, when asked on Friday whether prices would go up on 1 July, said: They must go up. There are no savings in this for us. If there were, we would certainly pass them on. How generous of him!But there are none. Therefore, prices at the pump will certainly rise. The breathtaking character of this particular spokesman for the oil industry was even worse in an earlier part of his interview. I invite all members of the House to listen very carefully, because this indicates precisely what this particular company, at least, may be interested in. He said this: We need probably 9c a litre, not the 6.7 per cent the government is talking about.What Mr McMaster was saying was that the straight excise cut, let alone the issue of cost savings, had to be 9c a litre. Nine cents a litre is based on a strike price not of 90c a litre, not of 85c a litre, but of 99c a litre. In making that claim, he was in effect arguing that the oil companies should be provided, courtesy of the federal Treasury and the Australian taxpayer, almost another 1c a litre by way of excise subsidy. According to the Shell company's website, which I checked shortly before question time, the weighted average of capital city petrol prices today is under 85c a litre. What Mr McMaster was asking for was a subsidy to offset the GST, based on a strike price not of 85c a litre but of 99c a litre. Bear in mind that we have a subsidy scheme of 1c and 2c for people living outside metropolitan areas, and prices outside metropolitan areas are nowhere near 99c a litre. In Cairns today, for example, petrol is 85c a litre. In many other towns around Australia, it is under 90c a litre.There are cost savings, contrary to what Mr McMaster and others assert. Only the Labor Party and some oil companies are saying there are no cost savings. Our advice from the Treasury, based on their modelling, is that the cost saving is 1½c a litre. We say to the oil companies of Australia: you pass those savings on in full. As with other companies, we are asking them to anticipate cost savings where they can. We are asking that of other companies and many are doing it. I noticed an advertisement in the press today from Woolworths, which said, `We will pass on our own cost savings under the new tax system to our customers.' I would say to at least one of those oil companies I have referred to: acknowledge that there are cost savings and give us an undertaking that you are going to pass them on. Are the oil companies really saying that it is impossible to anticipate any savings? Are they denying, as this spokesman is, that there are cost savings? The strike price of 90c a litre does provide an extra buffer for the consumer, based on today's prices, of close to half a cent a litre, because the current level is below 85c a litre. I believe that the government has acted appropriately and honourably in relation to these matters. </DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Deakin that I was really disturbed to read this morning a report in the Age, under the name of Mr Brad Norington - and it had a photograph of the Leader of the Opposition, so I assume I have the right party in the right country - which said:... a future Labor government would abolish secondary boycott laws under the Trade Practices Act, which protect employers against sympathy strikes If this is true - and I have a rough idea it is pretty accurate - this is the latest capitulation by the Leader of the Opposition to his trade union bosses. They talk about the Sherman Act and all sorts of other acts in the United States. If a Labor government were elected and this were to go through you would call it the Crean-Ferguson-George act because it would be a demonstration of the influence of the trade union movement on the Australian Labor Party.I have more than a passing interest in section 45D. It was when I was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Fraser government in 1976 that we wrote for the first time into the Trade Practices Act the section that became known as section 45D, aimed at secondary boycotts by trade unions. Ironically enough, it was aimed at secondary boycotts by the trade union movement in the oil industry, which had the effect of maintaining higher petrol prices than would otherwise have been the case. There is a certain amount of irony in that, and over the years it has been a battleground for the trade union movement. They have never accepted the fact that they should be treated the same as employers under the law. They have always wanted a privileged position under the law. They have always said you should have secondary boycott legislation imposing enormous fines on companies but, when it came to trade unions, you had to adopt a hands-off approach.As the minister, I can remember negotiating with the then Leader of the Opposition - a former leader of the ACTU who was ultimately to become the Prime Minister of Australia in 1983 - Mr Bob Hawke. I can remember his telling me how, if we went ahead, there would be blood flowing in the streets and that it represented an absolutely outrageous attack on the fundamental rights of the trade union movement of Australia. It represented no such attack. All it sought to do was to treat trade unions like the rest of the community. All it sought to do was to make all Australians equal before the law. All it sought to do was to say to a trade union that if it wrecked another business, it should suffer the same penalty as another business wrecking one of its competitors. That is all it sought to do. The only reason why the Labor Party in the year 2000 would want to get away with this is that they are even more subject to influence by the union movement than was the case in the 1970s and the 1980s.I have no doubt that this report is true in substance. I have no doubt that the union movement has once again demanded of the Labor Party that it reinstate a commitment to get rid of it. I can assure those who sit opposite that we will have plenty of opportunity to remind you of this. We will have plenty of opportunity to tell every small business in Australia that you will take away the protection of the secondary boycott laws. We will have every opportunity to tell the business community of Australia that you want, if you once more win power, to create a situation where everybody except the trade union movement is subject to the laws of Australia. That philosophy is quite unacceptable to us, and I believe it is unacceptable to the great majority of the Australian people. </DOC>

 - What I am saying is that we have put in place an arrangement that represents all that any government can do to give effect to the commitment we made. I am also saying to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, if he wants to quote to me oil companies, or he wants to quote to me business organisations, the basis of the argument that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is putting is that there are no cost savings at all. That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to assert. Indeed, many people in the oil industry are trying to assert that.To use an example that the Acting Treasurer has used, when you carry petrol from a terminal to a service station, you do it in large trucks which are fuelled by diesel. That diesel will fall by 24c a litre as from 1 July. Is Mr McMaster saying, is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying and are other spokesmen for the oil industry saying that that will not represent cost savings for the Australian community? This represents an attempt by the Labor Party once again to avoid the responsibility to articulate any kind of alternative policy. On Melbourne radio this morning, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked 16 times to clarify what Labor would do with different aspects of the tax system. The only commitment he could give in response to those 16 questions was that the Labor Party would keep the GST.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Australian government is continuing to promote the peace process in the Solomon Islands. We have been doing that in three ways: firstly, providing neutral venues for talks; secondly, encouraging and facilitating discussion between all the parties towards peace; and, thirdly, continuing to assess and respond to humanitarian needs as necessary. Two weeks ago when I and some colleagues from the Commonwealth were in the Solomon Islands we encouraged a continuation of the truce that had been put in place for our visit. I am pleased to say that that truce has held up in Honiara, although not necessarily all over Guadalcanal, for the full two weeks. During my visit, I took the opportunity on Saturday of meeting with the Governor-General, a number of government leaders and the leader of the opposition and I brought together on an Australian landing craft the premiers of Guadalcanal and Malaita. I also met with representatives of the Guadalcanal militants. The Malaita Eagle Force met with officials in my party but they did not attend official talks, indicating that further disturbances in Guadalcanal through the course of last week needed to be addressed by them as a first order priority. The High Commissioner in Honiara, Martin Sharp, is visiting the affected areas in Guadalcanal during the course of today to assess what humanitarian assistance might be required.  We are continuing to encourage militants and political leaders to participate in cease-fire talks. We had hoped that the Malaita Eagle Force would join with the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the premiers of Guadalcanal and Malaita and others on board HMAS Tobruk for talks on Sunday to discuss a cease-fire, but the Malaita Eagle Force decided they would stay away as a result of the violence which had taken place in the eastern part of Guadalcanal during the course of last week. Nevertheless, we are continuing to urge the Malaita Eagle Force to participate in talks. I do not wish to foreshadow what their conclusions may be, but we are continuing to work at encouraging them to do so in the next couple of days. The Solomon Islands parliament is scheduled to meet on Wednesday. In discussions with government members and the opposition, they all indicated to me their willingness to participate in the parliamentary meeting on Wednesday. But, frankly, I think it very much remains to be seen how this session will turn out in the end. As I have said for the last couple of weeks, the situation in the Solomon Islands remains fragile. I am of the view that it is important that Australia continues to do what it can to promote a peace process there. That is no easy task, but I think it is appropriate that we continue to do that. - The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith interjects: should we send in-line police into the Solomon Islands? We have made it clear all along and we still make it clear - and so do the rest of the South Pacific Forum and the rest of the international community - that we do not wish to send unarmed Australian police into in-line positions to try to keep separate the Malaitans from the Guadalcanalese. We do not think shedding Australian blood for that cause is an appropriate risk for Australians. I am quite happy for that to be a difference between the government and the opposition. I am quite happy to say that we will do what we can diplomatically, but we will not be invading the Solomon Islands.</DOC>

 - I stand by the claim, which is clearly defensible on any analysis, that the strike rate is based on 90c a litre. - The original disposition of the government, as I think I indicated in an interview over the weekend, was to adopt a strike rate of 85c a litre. We decided in the final analysis to adopt a strike rate of 90c a litre, and one of the consequences of that was to provide, as I say, an additional buffer and benefit for consumers. I take the opportunity of reminding the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, at present, according to the advice I had just before question time, the average weighted capital city price is in the order of just under 85c a litre. - The strike rate that we have adopted of 90c a litre - and it was set out very clearly and very well in the news release put out by the Acting Treasurer on Thursday - means that, in effect, if current prices were to continue, you would have a half a cent a litre buffer. Part of the decision making process was to provide a strike rate that meant that that would be the consequence. If you had looked at the average of petrol prices over the last six months, you would have produced a figure of well under 85c a litre. But, in taking a strike rate of 90c a litre, we have, in effect, provided an additional buffer for the Australian consumer based on the experience of the last six months. Is the Leader of the Opposition saying that there is something wrong or ungenerous about that? Is the opposition, along with some of the oil companies, asserting that there are no cost savings to be had for oil companies in this? If they are asserting that there are no cost savings, they are the only business organisations in Australia -   - Mr Speaker, I do not have anything to add.</DOC>

 - I know the honourable member for Sturt is aware that the OECD has issued the first report on its growth project to the ministerial council meeting in Paris, which is being chaired by the Treasurer. It is an honour for Australia to chair the OECD meeting of the ministerial council. Australia was elected to chair this meeting; it is not rotated through OECD members. The election of Australia is recognition of Australia's strong economic performance and record of policy reform and innovation. The OECD report entitled Is there a new economy? identifies Australia as one of only six OECD countries, including the United States, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway, that have been able to harness higher growth and higher productivity. There has been a jump in Australia's productivity growth in recent years. Productivity growth has averaged 2.8 per cent per annum under the coalition compared to an average of 1.5 per cent per annum under Labor.The IMF, in a report examining productivity growth and structural reform in Australia, which was released earlier this year, concluded that in recent years productivity growth in Australia had increased to rates `not seen since the golden age of the 1960s'. The March quarter national accounts, which the Treasurer referred to last week in this House, showed that this is the 12th consecutive quarter of through the year growth of four per cent or above. Such an outcome has been recorded only once previously, and that was from June 1968 to March 1971. The strong growth of the Australian economy has resulted in strong employment growth. Since the coalition came to office, some 712,000 new jobs have been created. The unemployment rate is now 6.7 per cent - the lowest for a decade. Importantly, the outlook for employment growth is positive and the unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 6¼ per cent by the June quarter 2001. From there on, we will be on the verge of the lowest unemployment rates in a quarter of a century. The government's commitment to sound macro-economic policies and ongoing structural reform has delivered strong economic growth and increased employment opportunities. Australia's good macro-economic management has been recognised by international organisations, such as the OECD and the IMF. It is this government that is implementing the policies that will bring further benefits to the Australian nation in the future.</DOC>

 - I believe that the effect of not only the announcements that were made on Friday but also the other policies announced by the government will be to give -  - He laughs, `Oh, yeah.' You did not say `Oh, yeah' when you jacked up petrol by 6c a litre in 1993. You did not say `Oh, yeah' then. Oh, yeah, I remember that very well - and so do the Australian people. Oh, yeah, they do. They also remember that you went to that election and you not only promised that you would cut income tax but you also promised that there would be no increases in indirect taxation. Oh, yeah, we all remember that. We all remember it very well. What happened? Was there any compensation for the pensioner? Was there any compensation for the bloke in the bush in 1993? Was there any compensation? Of course there was not. You are frauds when it comes to taxation policy. You are the greatest frauds that this country has ever seen. You have over here a group of men and women who are trying to do something decent for the tax system of Australia.  - I would merely add that if the people, the producers, the exporters and the hardworking men and women of regional Australia want a decent deal on fuel prices, they will continue to support, as I know they do, the taxation reform policies of the government. - Mr Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can energise himself with all the laughter he wants as we are in the last week of the countdown towards the introduction of the new taxation system. I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that all the laughter, all the point scoring, all the thrust and counter-thrust and all the argument and counter-argument over the next few days is going to be put to one side by the Australian people when they make a judgment. You hope and pray that it will not, but can I tell you it will. The Australian people are intelligent enough to make a judgment. They will make a judgment about you. They will remember the way in which you misled the Australian public. - The people of regional Australia know that under our policies -  - He asked me about the price of petrol in the bush, didn't he? - Oh, no, he didn't ask me about the price of petrol in the bush. That being the case, Mr Speaker, I have finished my answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. The figures on industrial disputes are very clear. When Labor was in office, the number of days lost per thousand employees was 190 per year. That was Labor's average over their 13 years. In the time that the coalition has been in government, the number of disputes and working days lost have been half that number. That is, in part, as a result of the reforms that we introduced in 1996.   - I have seen the article in the Age referred to by the Prime Minister earlier in question time today. With all due respect to the Prime Minister, I can now do better than his reference to the Age. In fact, it is my great pleasure today to launch a new policy. I am going to launch the Labor Party's policy. Mr Speaker, I am sure you will be as interested in this as all other members of the House. In fact, there are probably a few backbenchers on the other side who have not yet realised that it is their policy, but I can assure them that it is. I table Labor's policy, approved last Friday, which includes, amongst other things, a commitment to the abolition of the Trade Practices Act bans on secondary boycotts. - I will go to the detail in a moment. - They're not bad, are they? I have launched their policy for them and now they want me to read the damn thing! This policy abolishes an important part of the law which protects businesses, particularly small businesses. The absolute consequence of this proposal from Labor, if ever it were to be made law -  - I launched their policy, then they wanted me to read it and now they reckon it is not worth reading because it has been around for 20 years! I will tell you what it means. First of all, it means that they want to weaken the Trade Practices Act provisions so that the unions are above the law compared with everybody else. The second thing they want to do is not just go back to 1996; they want to rewrite the provisions. Why? Because the trade union leadership has said, `In return for donations to your campaign at the next election, we expect you to give us a privileged position.' The third thing they want to do - as they claim that they will have these laws in the industrial relations laws of the land - is weaken the enforcement and the penalties under the Trade Practices Act. This is a proposition to make a wholesale transfer of power to a union elite, representing fewer and fewer of the work force. As the ACTU meets this week, the one thing they are not going to admit is that in the private sector work force less than one in five are members of a union. Labor's answer to that is, `You cannot secure membership, so we will provide you with a privileged position by legislating a special deal for the trade union leadership.'The consequence of this is more strikes, lower pay and less productivity. In the end, the average rank and file worker will miss out. It should never be forgotten that, when Labor was last in power, from start to finish low income earners saw a reduction of five per cent in their real wages. In the time that we have been in power, because we have had a fairer system of laws, not only has the number of disputes been down but workers have earned more and more jobs have been created. This is a policy prescription for giving more power to trade union bosses at the expense of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I have not seen that statement which is attributed to Mr Vaile. I have learnt from long experience never to accept as accurate a representation of a quote from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I had some further evidence of this in question time earlier today when he quoted something in relation to Alan Jones. He quoted me as saying:Well, anybody who is saying it will rise as a result of the GST is telling lies.Of course, he did not then go on to acknowledge that the three items I referred to in the rest of my answer bore upon: firstly, the reduction in fuel excise; secondly, the exemption from excise for off-road use; and, finally, the fact that the GST, unlike excise, will be rebateable for business purposes. The capacity of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to mislead knows no bounds.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to get a question from the honourable member for Mallee which requests me to detail to the House the advantages of the new tax system - a positive question. In five days time, the government's reform will give Australia a tax system for the new century, one which will benefit Australian families and investors. Under the government's plan, income tax will be significantly reduced. There will be some $12 billion of tax cuts annually. From Saturday, 1 July, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face marginal tax rates of 30 per cent or less, compared with 30 per cent of taxpayers now. This will be achieved by increasing the tax-free threshold and cutting all marginal rates except the top rate. In respect of Australian families, through the extension of the family tax initiative which the government introduced in 1997, there will be assistance. The family package will provide benefits totalling $2.4 billion per year to over two million families. A one-income family that has a child under five and is earning $29,000 per annum will be around $60 per week better off from next Saturday as a result of the tax cuts and the improvements to the family assistance introduced by this government.I would also like to note some recent work by Woolworths supermarkets regarding the impact of tax reform on consumers. I think this is very pertinent to the question I was asked. Today Woolworths' Chief Executive Officer, Mr Roger Corbett, said that customers at Woolworths supermarkets would be pleasantly surprised by overall lower grocery prices from Saturday onwards. He said:We have  applied New Tax System savings to Choice Magazine's current standard basket of groceries - the result is a price drop between 2.4% and 3.3% across the nation.That is more good news for Australian families. The honourable member for Mallee also asked me about investors. The new tax reform will bring about business tax reforms as well. These include lower capital gains tax rates and lower company tax rates. That will benefit investors and make Australian businesses more internationally competitive, especially in our region. On capital gains tax, individuals will only have to pay half of any gain that they make, provided they have held the asset for at least 12 months, and from 1 July the maximum rate will be 24.25 per cent. The government has also legislated scrip for scrip roll-over relief that will be of great assistance in respect of takeovers. For those who are investing, there will be a refund of imputation credits. That is a broad summary of a number of the initiatives that will benefit Australians starting from Saturday of this week. I looked for some inspiration this morning in a report on 3AW which involved the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went through an extensive interview. On 16 occasions, as the Prime Minister pointed out, he was asked to indicate what he would do differently, what the Labor Party would do differently with the tax system. The total take-out is that they would keep the GST. Some of the questions are interesting:Neil Mitchell: If you win the next election, would you dump the GST?Simon Crean: We can't dump the GST.Neil Mitchell: Why can't you dump it?Simon Crean: Because there is too much sunk cost, so to speakNeil Mitchell: What will your promise be in respect of [a particular aspect of] the GST?Simon Crean: Our promise is to roll back the GST.We saw last week what roll-back means: it means a lot more in the way of costs for caravan park residents and for boarding house residents. The interview continues:Neil Mitchell: How will you make up the extra money when you roll back?Simon Crean: It will be fully costed. It just goes on. It is quite fascinating; after I finished reading it, the only thing I could think of for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that he is a red-hot favourite for the Hansie Cronje obfuscation award for the year.</DOC>

 -  Mr Speaker -  - `The workers' friend' does have a good ring about it - doesn't it, Prime Minister? - It is an excellent question, and a very good interjection from the opposition, the best thing they have said today. Mr Speaker, I can tell you the people who are most opposed to giving the workers a greater say: the people who sit opposite. They have long opposed the idea of secret ballots and the principle of giving workers a say in the affairs of their own unions. The coalition government is all about choice: we are about giving people choice when it comes to whether or not they enter into an agreement; we are all about choice whether you are in a union or not in a union; and we also believe people should have a choice as to whether or not they go on strike. That choice should be a real one, it should be a choice free of intimidation and it should be a choice that people should be able to exercise by way of secret ballot. This was coalition policy at the last federal election. I want to advise members today that we are still resolute in our support for the policy, which was endorsed by the Australian people at the last election. Therefore, I will today be reintroducing a bill which is to provide for secret ballots before strike action.We have had many discussions with the Democrats in recent times. The Democrats have said to the government that, rather than having an omnibus bill containing numerous measures, they believe it is better if policy reforms are dealt with on a bill by bill basis. Therefore, taking up that public suggestion of the Democrats, we will be introducing a series of bills this week on key workplace relations issues which will provide the parties in the Senate with an opportunity to consider them on their merits. The Democrats have said a bit about this already on the public record. In fact, Senator Andrew Murray said in a Senate committee report last November: ... Democrats are also strongly supportive of the democratic protections afforded by secret balloting processes.Senator Meg Lees also spoke on the issue. She raised her concerns about the details of our proposal prior to Christmas but, in respect of the principle, she said that, if the government was prepared to sit down and talk with the Democrats, then they were prepared to do so in a constructive way. She said:If we could go back to government, talk to them - as you are talking to us, you know, in what I would describe as a reasonable and logical fashion - then the answer comes out as, yes, there should be that provision.She was speaking on Radio 2GB on 29 November last year in respect of the provision of secret ballots. So I believe that, on the basis of public comments, there is some support in the Senate for the principle of secret ballots. The government is prepared to sit down and negotiate with the Democrats about the details of such provisions. But we believe the principle is terribly important. It was voted on and endorsed by the Australian people, and I think it is another test of the Labor Party as to whether they support the rank and file trade union members or they simply do as the trade union leadership and elites tell them to do. There is no doubt this is a measure that would give real power to rank and file trade union members in deciding whether or not they should participate in strike action. Labor will, of course, vote against the principle of secret ballots, because they are opposed to giving workers a say.</DOC>

 - You can always rely on one thing about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: he will always go right over the top. That is exactly what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is really saying is that, unlike other companies, oil companies should not pass on their cost saving as a result of taxation reform. He is not only saying that they should not pass on those savings; he is also saying that oil companies, unlike other Australian companies, should not, where possible, anticipate cost reductions. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is also falsely alleging to the Australian public, along with the member for Batman, who asked me a question based on a hypothetical price of petrol in a certain area, is that the arrangements announced by the Acting Treasurer on Thursday were based on a strike price of other than 90c a litre. That is at the core of this whole debate. The beginning of the deception of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was when he appeared on the PM program on Thursday night, along with a lot of the other spokesmen for the oil companies, including Mr McMaster from BP. They argued -  -  - Yes, those as well. They all argued incorrectly that the strike price on which these arrangements were based was in the order of 70c to 75c a litre. - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. As always, his interventions are helpful. - As indicated by the Acting Treasurer, it was based on a strike price of 90c a litre. That 90c a litre means that, in addition to the cost savings of the oil companies - which he denies exist, apparently - there is an additional buffer. Based on current prices, which were used as the basis of the question asked by the member for Batman, you have got an additional buffer of about half a cent a litre. There are cost savings.   - The advice we have from Treasury is that those cost savings are 1½c a litre. Only the Labor Party and some of the oil companies - I repeat, some of the oil companies - are asserting that there are no cost savings. We say to them that they should pass on those cost savings as other companies are passing on their cost savings.  - The whole basis of tax reform is that the cost savings earned by Australian companies should not be pocketed by those companies but should in fact be passed on to the Australian consumer. The arrangements that we have put in place reflect the determination of the government to meet the commitments that we have made to the Australian public. I would remind the House again that when the Labor Party were last in charge of the affairs of this nation they, without warning, without compensation and in blatant breach of election undertakings, increased the excise on petrol by no less than 6c a litre. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the man who was part of that giant fraud, that giant deceit of the Australian community, has got the nerve to align himself with those in the oil industry who would assert that there are no cost savings. I say to him and I say to the oil companies of Australia that there are cost savings, and they should be passed to the Australian consumer and to nobody else.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that, along with my colleague Mr Reith, I think I can reveal a touch of Labor Party policy today. It is in relation to coastal shipping reform. Australia's coastal shipping policy represents a balance between providing a preference for licensed ships and the commercial needs of Australian shippers moving cargo interstate. This balanced approach allows for the issue of a single-voyage permit to an unlicensed ship to engage in coastal movement of domestic freight when there is no suitable licensed ship available and when it is considered to be in the public interest. Some time ago the unions made a range of claims regarding the issue of single-voyage permits. There was a ruling last week on this matter. Justice Kenny of the Federal Court dismissed the Maritime Union's claims, finding that the issue of the two permits that were in question, for the Algarve and the J Emma, was in fact in full compliance with the requirements of the Navigation Act 1912 and he declared that the unions must pay all costs. The policy clearly states that the issue of these permits must be considered in the light of the public interest. But the question has to be asked: what do the unions know about or care for public interest? It is quite clear that they see the existence of shipping as serving only their interests, not the national interest. Justice Kenny noted that the approach adopted by the Maritime Union would `lead to capricious and absurd results'. What did he mean by capricious and absurd results? The union representative, to give you an illustration of this, bizarrely went so far as to claim that an Australian ship which might be only two feet long and capable of transporting just 10 grams of cargo should be used in preference to a foreign flag vessel capable of carrying the lot in one go. I do not know when we changed to metric, but the union claim that a ship two feet long capable of carrying only 10 grams of cargo ought to be used in preference to a foreign flag vessel capable of carrying the lot.  - I hear it asked how many ships are there of this size. It is your policy, so you ought to be able to tell us. According to the unions, this would be the case even if someone like BHP wanted to move 100,000 tonnes of coal. If they wanted to move 100,000 tonnes of coal, according to the union policy - capricious and absurd as it is; and we know that union policy one day is ALP policy the next day - these ships must be out here. To do the maths, if one tonne is one million grams, at 10 grams a trip that is 100,000 trips just to move one tonne. You have still got 99,999 to go. This is an absolute farce. Modern Australian unionism's policy is modern ALP policy, and it can only be described, in the words of Justice Kenny, as capricious and absurd.</DOC>

 - The arrangements that we have put in place will ensure that, as far as is possible, the commitments we made in relation to petrol will be kept. Those arrangements assume the following. Those arrangements assume that the goods and services tax impact will be offset by a combination of the excise arrangements and the cost savings, to which I have referred on countless occasions during question time. They were the commitments that were made by the government, and those are the commitments that the arrangements announced by the Acting Treasurer were designed to meet.  - They are the commitments that we made, and I am prepared, as always, to be accountable for the commitments the government has made, and that is the basis on which those arrangements have been entered into. Perhaps I will add an answer at the end of question time -  - to the example put to me by the member for Batman, and the arithmetic on that produces a very interesting result. - It has got some figuring on it. - I have not got it marked `confidential'. -  - I am informed that material in it is confidential although it is not marked `confidential'. Therefore I will not table it.</DOC>

 - I can tell the member for Pearce that Work for the Dole is such a great program that some unions now want to jump on the bandwagon. After the union movement had previously tried to sabotage Work for the Dole projects in New South Wales national parks, and schools and child-care centres right around Australia, the Western Australian Trades and Labor Council is now trying to recruit Work for the Dole participants to boost falling union membership. A few months ago, the Public Sector Union in the west tried to stop Work for the Dole in Perth schools but now an organisation called Unions WA has written to community work coordinators in the west inviting them to attend a seminar on how unions can help job seekers. This union letter includes the remarkable claim that unions are in fact the best organisations to inculcate a work ethic in job seekers. This Jekyll-and-Hyde attitude to Work for the Dole is a lot better than blanket opposition, but I should point out that Work for the Dole participants are certainly not employees. They have no right to strike, unlike the usual objects of union attention. The best thing that UnionsWA could do for job seekers is to ask their union mates around the country to stop sabotaging Work for the Dole projects and to support this great program. The union letter says:Our interest is based on our assessment that some form of  'Work for the Dole' is likely to be a feature of the landscape for the foreseeable future. It is therefore important to have a constructive engagement with the scheme in order to contribute to its basic settings.For once this is some union advice that members opposite should accept. This is one cave-in to the unions that the Leader of the Opposition should make, instead of denigrating this great program as he so often does.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn. I think I may even have heard him say it. I do not accept what he said. Mr McIntosh's argument, Mr McMasters's argument, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's argument and the argument of one of the representatives of the other oil companies are based upon the proposition that there are no cost savings to be achieved from taxation reform and at the very least there are no cost savings from taxation reform that are available immediately. That is an absurd proposition. It is not possible for anybody who has any understanding of the oil industry to say that there are no cost savings at all available on 1 July. That is a ridiculous proposition. It defies all of the evidence that was made available by the Acting Treasurer on Thursday when he made the announcement, with the example he gave of the reduction in the price of diesel and all of the other cost reductions that oil companies are going to enjoy. It also of course totally ignores the fact that the strike price of 90c a litre - the strike price that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refuses to accept - will provide an additional buffer of something like half a cent a litre based on current pricing for petrol around Australia. So the whole basis of the argument put forward by Mr McIntosh is, I believe, flawed and I do not accept it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. The government's training reforms have been particularly welcomed and effective in regional Australia. There are now almost half a million people in rural and regional Australia accessing publicly funded training. That is 100,000 more places in regional Australia than when the Labor Party was in office. It is very interesting that in relation to vocational education and training the traditional disadvantage in terms of participation which regional Australians have suffered in other areas does not apply in relation to vocational education and training.Participation is now at 8.9 per cent in rural Australia, some 9.4 per cent in remote Australia, outstripping that in the capital cities, which stands at 6.7 per cent. In other words, the government's training reforms have given enormous opportunities to communities and young people in regional and rural Australia to lift their skills. At December last year, there were 87,320 new apprentices in training in regional Australia - twice as many as in the last year of the Labor government. We expect that an additional 50,000 people will start a new apprenticeship this year in regional Australia. One of the factors in this will doubtless be the doubling of the number of New Apprenticeships centres in regional Australia to some 200 sites. The latest training policy of the Australian Education Union would see the destruction of some 350,000 training opportunities in Australia and the operation of closed shops in TAFEs throughout Australia, which would be particularly damaging in the regions. The AEU wants to get rid, essentially, of the private training providers. This is going to be a major challenge to the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party as they go to the conference in July. Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, and Denis Fitzgerald, the President of the Australian Education Union, have made it quite clear that they are going to be putting a great deal of pressure on the Leader of the Opposition to go along with the AEU policy and to adopt a discriminatory closed shop policy against private training providers. We have to remember that this is the Leader of the Opposition who has rolled over again and again to his trade union mates, who has given in to them, as we have seen in question time today, in a number of vital areas of industrial relations policy. In July he is going to roll over again. He is going to roll over again, as usual, to the trade unions, to give them a privileged position in the training system - the kind of privileged position that led to a reduction of 20,000 apprenticeships during one year of the time when he was education and training minister. It is this government which has expanded training opportunities in regional and rural Australia. It is the Labor Party whose policies are going to cut back on those opportunities because the Leader of the Opposition has not got the strength to stand up to the trade unions behind him. </DOC>

 - I am pleased to take this question. The opposition has, throughout question time today, made a series of assertions which effectively support the oil companies and endeavour to mislead the Australian people. What this is about is that the Australian taxpayers, through the federal government, will be giving some $2.2 billion in tax -  - Let me go back to that point. The simple fact is that, with excise reduction commencing from Saturday of some $2.2 billion, that takes up what the Commonwealth has been collecting for the states and territories ever since the High Court case which prevented the states and territories from imposing taxes. That is point No. 1. The second point is that, in the context of providing that benefit to motorists, it was struck at a rate of 90c, as the Prime Minister has said a number of times, and 6.7c per litre is the rebate, the reduction in excise, that is given. All Australians would expect the oil companies to give over to the motorists what they will make in the way of savings.  - Again, as I have indicated, the reduction in excise that applies from Saturday does take into account the taxes that were once previously put on by the states and territories. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has referred to a specific amount, which he indicated in his question was being pocketed by the Northern Territory. I do not accept that at this point of time. Nevertheless, I am more than happy to examine the question in detail and see if there is any accuracy in it, get advice on the subject and advise the honourable member if there is anything in the way of substance. On 3 February this year I noted a report in the Australian which referred to a 10c price hike in petrol over a period of three days. It went on to say that that price hike of 10c in three days included petrol excise - we have spoken about that today - and that oil companies had withdrawn discounts and rebates to petrol station operators. It referred to a weaker Australian dollar and higher world oil prices. Where was one member of the opposition when a 10c hike came in three days in February of this year? There was an acknowledgment that there are `many factors' in the prices. I further indicate to the honourable member for the Northern Territory that, whilst investigating the matters which he suggested in his letter, the Treasurer has written to the Northern Territory regarding this subsidy. I am prepared to provide to the honourable member full details of what was in that letter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I remind the House that the government, through the ACCC, is undertaking the most extensive price monitoring regime ever undertaken in Australia with the introduction of the new taxation system. The government has provided the ACCC with in excess of $56 million and the ACCC will be monitoring in excess of three million prices. In one area in particular the price monitoring will be very extensive and that is in relation to fuel price monitoring. The ACCC has advised me that the price monitoring of fuel will be the most extensive petrol price monitoring ever undertaken in Australia. The information will be passed to the ACCC on a daily basis. It will cover unleaded petrol, leaded petrol, diesel fuel, auto LPG and oils and lubricants. I take the opportunity to remind the House that there is currently a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on oils and lubricants which will be coming off. The ACCC will be policing petrol prices in nearly 4,000 locations across Australia, including over 1,400 service stations in rural and regional Australia, reflecting access to 70 per cent of the rural population of Australia. Permanent monitoring will occur in 800 sites, in 100 country towns, plus a further 150 towns on a random basis each week. Over 2,500 service stations in metropolitan Australia will have their petrol prices monitored by the ACCC. So a total of over 4,000 service stations out of 8,000 service stations in Australia will have their prices monitored by the ACCC. There is a further class of petrol retailers who maintain only one or two pumps, and those pumps are incidental to their main business, in small country towns. The ACCC is contacting those retailers and looking at what information can be provided.As I have said before, this is the most extensive price monitoring regime ever undertaken. It is backed up by section 75AU of the Trade Practices Act, which means that, if service station proprietors do not pass on the full benefits of reductions as a result of the abolition of embedded taxes, they may be guilty of price exploitation and liable to a fine of up to $10 million per offence for a company and up to half a million dollars for individuals. They are penalties that the Labor Party never put in place. Not on one occasion did the Labor Party put in place any price exploitation rules which would prevent consumers from being exploited by unworthy businesses. Not once when the Labor Party was increasing taxes did it ever have any price exploitation guidelines or price exploitation laws to protect consumers. That illustrates a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and the coalition. The coalition is about protecting consumers; the Labor Party is about doing them over.</DOC>

 - It is a fact that the government has done everything it can to keep the commitments that it made at the time of the last election in relation to fuel prices. It is also a fact that the weighted capital city average of a litre of fuel today is 83c. When you take into account that the government's arrangements were based on a 90c a litre strike price, it shows the extent of the additional buffer provided to these arrangements by the government's decisions.</DOC>

 - I have, in fact, had my attention drawn to calls for greater fairness. Amongst the pieces of paper that have come across my desk in the last couple of hours is a speech by the Leader of the Opposition to the union movement at Wollongong. The Leader of the Opposition was in full flight about issues of fairness. The Leader of the Opposition went on, page after page, about how a Labor government would bring back fairness to Australian society. Those sorts of claims seem, to many of us on this side of the House and, I dare say, to a great number of the Australian population, very strange indeed. They might well ask what was fair about driving unemployment to 11.2 per cent. They might well ask what was fair about driving interest rates to 23 per cent. The people he addressed might well have asked him what was fair about cutting the real wages of Australian workers during the 13 years that Labor were in government. They might well ask what was fair about promising l-a-w law tax cuts and then dumping them. They might well ask what was fair about increasing the price of petrol by 6c a litre, without warning and without compensation. They might ask what was fair about burdening our children with $96 billion of national debt and then trying, at every turn, to obstruct the efforts of a newly elected government to lift that debt burden from the shoulders of our children. Finally, they might well ask what is fair about a party that is committed to giving the trade union movement of this country a privileged position under the laws of Australia. The industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party would repeal the secondary boycott laws, wind back the way in which the laws of this country have been made to apply equally to all sections of the Australian community, and provide to the unions of Australia a privileged position under the laws of Australia. I believe that when the great bulk of the Australian people hear the word `fairness', the last man and the last party they would associate that with is the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As we have only a few days to go before the introduction of the new taxation system, I know that those who sit opposite are again scrounging the highways and byways of Australia to find some kind of evidence or some kind of support for their two-year-long campaign to create obstruction and confusion and to sow doubt in the minds and the attitudes of the Australian people. The news for the Australian Labor Party, despite their best efforts, is not good. As we get closer to 1 July, more and more people are beginning to understand that the campaign run by the Australian Labor Party has been the most negative campaign in post World War II Australian political history.When a government has the courage to do the right thing by the nation, it is very easy to run a negative campaign. You can start a hare running, you can tell a lie and you can distort the reality of the situation, which is precisely what those who sit opposite have done. The reality is that, as we get closer, more and more Australians are realising that the new taxation system is not only good for them but it is also good for Australia. It is good for Australia because it will reduce income tax for all Australian taxpayers. It is good for Australia because it will leave Australian families better off. It is good for rural Australia because it will deliver a 24c a litre reduction in diesel excise. It will provide cheaper fuel costs for the rural people of Australia. It is good for Australian exporters, and it is good for Australian business. Increasingly, Australian business is recognising the benefits of the new taxation system. For example, a press release today from the Australian Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers said:Contrary to reports of gloom about current and prospective business conditions, manufacturing companies do not appear unduly pessimistic about growth prospects in the post-GST period.The report goes on to express a sense of hope and optimism about the economic future of Australia. I know that is disappointing to the Labor Party. All the Labor Party wants is gloom, doom and disappointment because it thinks that if it talks the economy down long enough and hard enough it will succeed. But the Australian people are determined not to be deceived by that. The Australian people know that this government has been willing to embrace with courage far-sighted economic reforms. Those reforms will strengthen the Australian economy, those reforms will make Australians better off, and those reforms will be seen in the fullness of time - and I believe certainly by next year - as reforms which do the government great credit and do the Labor Party great discredit for having tried to stop them.You may sit there with your smug, complacent smirking responses today, but as these reforms work their way through the Australian community month after month - as Australian taxpayers benefit from the tax reforms; as the states of Australia realise that we are underwriting their capacity to provide more resources for roads, schools, hospitals, and police; as Australian exporters reap the benefits of GST exports; as Australian business reap the benefits of lower costs to the tune of $7 billion a year; as those benefits spread through the Australian community more and more - the people of Australia will remember that we fought for those reforms; and they will remember that you tried to stop them.As time goes by, despite any temporary truculence you may experience along the way, nothing can alter the fact that the Australian people have enough commonsense to know a decent, committed, reformist government when they see one, and that is the government that I am proud to lead. We have attempted reforms that you know in your heart are right. You know that tax reform is necessary, just as you knew that privatisation was necessary. You pretend to the people now that you would not privatise Telstra but, if you became Prime Minister, you would do so, just as you did in relation to the Commonwealth Bank. And so it is, as time goes on, that more and more of the business community of Australia recognise the benefits of these reforms. A media release from Hayes Knight, accountants, indicated that 90 per cent of businesses are ready for the GST. They said:There is no doubt that, in time, the new tax system will create a better business environment. Equally, it is understood that there will be some headaches in the transition.Of course there will be some transitional difficulties - we have never denied that - but the bottom line, as indeed for all business organisations, is that this is a reform, courageously undertaken by this government, which is good not only for Australians but for the entirety of the Australian nation.</DOC>

 - I will look at the budget paper. I never take for granted anything you say about anything. It is always a very wise precaution. I will have a look at the budget paper, but all of these questions are asked in the context of the excise arrangements that were announced by the Acting Treasurer last Thursday. Those excise arrangements are based on a straight cut in excise and also the arrangement for the pass through of cost savings. It remains our view that all of the cost savings that are available should be passed through. We expect companies to pass them through promptly. We expect companies to anticipate cost savings, and we do not believe that oil companies are an exception to that rule.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for that question. The honourable member for Gilmore is one of those many members on this side of the House - and I know there are many on the other side - who take a very keen interest in the defence needs of Australia. This morning I had the opportunity of launching the Defence discussion paper. The launch was attended by my colleagues the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and also by the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham. This particular discussion paper represents a first in policy formulation in the defence area in this country. It is a discussion paper that is designed to involve the people of Australia in the formulation of our defence policy. There will be a very extensive public consultation process facilitated by an expert group led by Andrew Peacock, a friend and former colleague who is the former and, might I say, very exemplary Ambassador to the United States - a man who did a very fine and talented job in Washington on behalf of the Australian people. His contribution to the diplomatic life of Washington is still very well and very fondly remembered.This discussion paper is designed, as I say, to involve the Australian people in the process of building defence policy. We do not take the view that defence policy is something that can be handed down like a tablet from a mountain; we take the view that the Australian people are entitled to feel ownership of it and are entitled to be involved in the consultation process. The discussion paper encourages discussion in four main areas: Australia's current and strategic environment and interests; the reform process and efficiency within Defence; current capabilities and technological options for future planning; and options for capability development over the next 15 years.  I want to express my thanks to the Minister for Defence for the leadership that he has displayed in relation to his department and in the defence community generally. He has been the driving force behind this discussion paper and the driving force behind the whole consultation process. I look forward most warmly to the consultation process. The Minister for Defence and I will involve ourselves in that as is appropriate at various stages. I indicated this morning when I launched the discussion paper something that I have indicated on a number of other occasions, that is, that I believe that, in the changed strategic environment in which Australia operates, the time has come when this country must spend more rather than less on defence provision. That is a view that I hope is shared by the opposition and I hope it is a view that is shared within the Australian community. We do live in a different strategic environment. The world has changed a great deal, particularly in our region. I believe there is a heightened interest in the Australian community in debate on defence and defence issues. I think the release of this discussion paper is both appropriate and timely, and I look forward to the response of the Australian public and, ultimately, the development of a white paper on the future defence needs of Australia.</DOC>

 - I can only repeat what I said earlier. This is a debate about the GST on petrol and the compensatory arrangements that have been introduced by the government, which are in two elements. One of them is the straight cut in excise; the other is a passing on of cost savings. I have explained that ad nauseam. You know that is the answer. I wonder why you asked the question.</DOC>

 - Members of the House and, I am sure, the honourable member for Hughes would be aware that many organisations have identified the significant benefits to Australia which result from the taxation reforms - benefits such as improving our indirect taxation arrangements and cutting company tax, capital gains tax and income tax. Access Economics has, for example, estimated that the government's reforms will grow the economy and create nearly 200,000 new jobs. Moody's Investors Service last week stated that:Australian tax changes, scheduled to begin in July, will stimulate growth.Their sovereign analyst for Australia said:I think the tax reform which will come into place in July is a positive step. It is positive in terms of economic efficiency. ... a tax structure which should encourage growth. In addition, the removal of the wholesale sales tax in July will lower the cost of exports and boost our export competitiveness.Other international bodies have also endorsed the government's tax reform package. The OECD, in its survey of the Australian economy which it released last December, stated:Tax security will be better assured by a GST than by the indirect taxes it replaces.And:The reduction in marginal income tax rates and marginal effective tax rates will improve work and saving incentives.That report concluded:The introduction of a more efficient tax system in July should help to consolidate the productivity gains that are now being seen ... Last week a new report released by Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney also confirmed the significant benefits of tax reform which will flow to Australian consumers and businesses. The report estimates that the level of economic growth is expected to increase by around 1.6 per cent in the longer term as a result of the government's reforms. The report also predicts that the reforms will boost exports and investment - and we know that increased economic growth, increased exports and higher investment mean more jobs for Australians. In particular, the report notes that the indirect tax reforms will boost GDP through having more efficient indirect taxes, rather than the narrow and inefficient taxes such as the wholesale sales tax, bed taxes and financial institution duty. It also notes that indirect tax reforms will have the effect of lowering the cost of new business investment as a result, boosting the long run level of business investment. This report goes on to say that the government's business tax reforms will also boost growth by treating entities, industries and assets more evenly for taxation purposes. Again the report states: This more level playing field should improve the quality of investment decisions and lead to a more effective use of capital. In addition, lower compliance costs are expected to flow from the reforms.So, all in all, this report once again demonstrates the benefits of the government's tax plan for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I obviously have no knowledge of the personal circumstances of the case referred to by the honourable member but, if he would care to provide me with some more details, I would be happy to investigate how the legislation may affect his particular circumstances. The reality is that in Australia we have never provided tax deductibility for hobbies. Those sorts of activities are perfectly worthwhile and honourable pastimes but they are not supported by the tax system. There have been occasions when people have been able to take advantage of various elements of the taxation laws to be able to in fact gain some taxation benefits from their hobbies that are not available to other taxpayers. This legislation is an endeavour to ensure that the benefits available for business, and indeed for farmers in business, are quarantined to those who are genuinely involved in their businesses rather than to people who might really be conducting a hobby.As the Treasurer said, in answer to a similar question a week or so ago, there are a number of tests which need to be passed for someone to qualify for the tax benefits under the new arrangements. You only have to pass one of those tests. It is quite a generous system which will ensure that those people who have farm incomes, but for seasonal or other circumstances their incomes have fallen below what would normally be their expectations, are not adversely affected. It takes account of those people who are in a development phase in their properties - they will still be able to claim their benefits. It also takes account of those people who earn some off-farm income up to $40,000 - they are also excluded from these new arrangements. This new legislation is an endeavour to ensure that those people who are claiming benefits for a business are indeed genuinely involved in the business and to differentiate them from those who are only engaging in a hobby. If the honourable member would like to provide me with more details of the case that he has referred to, I would be happy to respond in more detail. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. Yes, I have seen the reports. I noted, for example, in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning that there was an article entitled `Labor put on notice to roll back GST'. The President of the ACTU, Ms Burrow, told the policy making ACTU congress in Wollongong that unions `clearly want the GST wound back'. As for this declaration by the ACTU - this indication that the GST should be rolled back on the essentials of life including such things as clothing, rent and all food - we know that when the ACTU declares something, the Leader of the Opposition caves in. I guess it comes from the pressure of having three former ACTU bosses in his team. Undoubtedly, he will crumble again. I noted that there has been a campaign on this by the union movement for some time. The AMWU Secretary, Doug Cameron, on television a couple of Sundays ago was asked this question on the GST:How far would you expect a Labor government to roll back a GST?' Cameron:A long way, a long way.When asked specifically, `What would you like removed?' he said:We certainly don't believe that there should be a tax on clothing.That means a roll-back of $1.7 billion on this item alone - no tax on fur coats, no tax on Zegna suits. So here we see, all of a sudden, a first cut of the so-called roll-back by the ACTU, which will flow to the Labor Party very, very quickly. We all know that roll-back simply means making the tax system more complex while putting up income tax to pay for it. That is a fact. Don't just take my word for it - let me quote some experts. Commenting on the comparisons of the new tax system in Australia a couple of weeks ago, Mr John Shewan, the Chief of Tax Practice in PricewaterhouseCoopers New Zealand, said this in answer to the following question:Question: Can any political party unroll a GST really once it is unfurled?Answer: Realistically, no. To repeal it means that you obviously have to replace it with something. We all know what the something is, the Australian people know what the something is: a reduction in those tax cuts which start from this Saturday, brought about by this government. Mr Stephen Harrison, the Chief Executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants -  - As I was indicating, another independent person, Mr Stephen Harrison, the Chief Executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia, stated earlier this year:If a future government were to introduce even further exemptions, we will be taking ourselves backwards into the complex environment that we currently face for the wholesale sales tax. We'll be turning back the clock and destroying many of the benefits that can be accrued from a simplified system through the GST.Mr Mike Bannon from Duesburys Chartered Accountants, Canberra, said:More exemptions, as envisaged by Mr Beazley, would result in more pages, more uncertainty and disputes between the ATO and taxpayers. Self-interest groups would be relentless in their claims for more exemptions.Mr Curt Rendall, the Director of the New South Wales Small Business Development Corporation, said:He - referring to Mr Beazley - should butt out. The sector is starting to engage in the GST, they are starting to come to grips with it. ... Then Mr Beazley comes along and says there will be changes if Labor gets into Government. That does nothing but confuse small business. Professor Peter Dixon was once described by the Leader of the Opposition as one of the `pre-eminent economic modellers of this nation'. That is what he said about Professor Peter Dixon. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition described him as a `world renowned independent expert'. So let us listen to what Professor Peter Dixon had to say. He was asked:Is it feasible for Labor to roll it back?His answer:I don't think so. If you're going to have a GST, you should have a very broad based GST and as simple a GST as possible. We saw last week that the first cast-iron guarantee on roll-back in relation to caravan park residents and boarding house residents actually amounted to a roll-forward: additional cost in rent to those who live in caravan parks or in boarding houses. The first cast-iron policy on the subject was rolled forward at greater cost to those that are affected.</DOC>

 - As it happens, I haven't; my attention has not been drawn to that statement. But it also happens that I do not always take on face value what those opposite might say. When you are listening to somebody over there and they say something, it is never quite what they allege it to be. I have a very good example of that - and this is on the subject, just to anticipate the point of order on relevance from my mate opposite. The rebuttal of the interjection and point of order will be that what I am about to say does relate to the question of excise on petrol, and that is the basis of the question he has asked me. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up and asked me a question about rates of excise, he quoted from a budget paper. I said that I would have to have a look at that, because I did not assume that what he said was right. And, sure enough, he has done it again. He quoted an excise rate of 35.0357 per litre. - Okay, 35.7. He said `That has gone up to 37-something; therefore, you're misleading the Australian public.' What, of course, he didn't say was that there was a footnote that said that these rates refer to the Commonwealth component of excise. - That's right, he says. When you add in the state component that we collect on behalf of the state, you see that there is a significant reduction in the amount of excise being collected by the Commonwealth. He knows, everybody who has studied this knows, that when the High Court declared the franchise arrangements of the states invalid, the Commonwealth government put in place an arrangement whereby this excise was collected by the Commonwealth on behalf of the states. Those payback arrangements have been subsumed in the arrangements in relation to the GST whereby the states get every last cent of the GST revenue. This sort of pathetic attempt - which has formed the basis of about 10 questions from the opposition - to suggest that we have actually increased the Commonwealth's excise take, when in reality we have reduced it, is just another example of the pathetic capacity of the opposition to misrepresent the truth to the Australian public. - We will check the transcript. We won't rely on your report.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I promise you I did not put him up to that. - As they say, if the cap fits, wear it. I am aware of changes which are being proposed to Australia's Trade Practices Act provisions in respect of secondary boycotts. To use the word `change' is a bit of an understatement. The Labor Party is proposing to abolish the provisions in the Trade Practices Act -  - The interjection is `And?' What the opposition want me to say - I am quite happy to say it - is that the Labor Party's view is that it is better to have these provisions, but they are going to change the provisions. They want these provisions - that is the first little bit of deception - in industrial law. - There is a reason why they didn't work. The reason was that there were no penalties attached to the provisions. This is just a little Labor Party deception. What your proposal is -  - You ought to know what your proposal is. You have been mouthing it as it has been given to you, the Labor Party, by the ACTU. The provisions in the Trade Practices Act ensure that we have the ACCC to enforce them but, furthermore, significant penalties for people who breach the law. And there ought to be significant penalties for people who breach the law, whether they are businesses or trade union leaders. That, of course, is the rub.The fact is that when the Leader of the Opposition was down there talking to the Wollongong ACTU meeting today what he was saying is, `Don't worry, fellers, if we get in there will be a special deal for you.' Special privileges for trade union mates, and the particular privilege that he wants to provide to the union movement is to ensure that there are no penalties. - I will tell you what is convincing, and that is the existing penalties under the Trade Practices Act which will no longer be available for people who breach the law who happen to be your mates in the trade union movement. Section 45E of the Trade Practices Act has a penalty for breach of that provision of $10 million. Is there such a provision under the Workplace Relations Act or any amendment that the Labor Party would make in the future? No way known. Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act has a penalty provision of $750,000. Is there any such like provision in the Workplace Relations Act? There is none; absolutely nothing. Sections 45DB, 45E and 45EA are all provisions which provide protection for small business. If you breach those provisions, what is the penalty in each case? Up to $750,000. It is no wonder the Labor Party and a former trade union official, in this case the shadow minister, are in favour of giving a privileged position to his mates.It is no wonder that this latest proposal has been roundly condemned around the country. For example, Tim Colebatch says in the Age: And union power would be revived by restoring the right to launch secondary boycotts - perhaps the most crippling weapon unions wielded in the old days - and outlawing individual agreements. The Daily Telegraph editorial today is headed `Beazley's promise a folly'. It says: This concession to the union movement will not increase the wages of workers, but simply provides union officials with the power to legally hold business to ransom.  Who will suffer from that? Not just the businesses but the rank-and-file workers that the Labor Party claims to represent. I could only find one authoritative source of support for the Labor Party's position. This is the quote: And at the same time there is a progressive side to Beazley's statement in that it lends to the workers' claim and assists in building broader working-class and community unity. This should be welcomed.Who would make such a claim? The only support they have had outside the trade union movement is in none other than a newsletter dated 14 June 2000: Vanguard, the Communist Party newsletter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. One of the significant achievements of the Howard government has been the rebuilding of the apprenticeship system and, for the first time, giving a national framework to apprenticeships. I am pleased to inform the House that, according to latest estimates from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, the number of new apprenticeships continues to grow. At 31 March 2000, there were 264,210 new apprentices in training, over 4,300 places more than the revised December quarter figure of 259,870. This is a record figure for new apprenticeships in Australia and it shows the commitment of this government to expanding quality training opportunities for young people. There is, however, a cloud on the horizon of these statistics. That cloud is the performance of the Labor states - Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales.In Queensland, commencements in new apprenticeships have dropped markedly over the last nine months. In Victoria, commencements in apprenticeships have dropped sharply in the last four months. In New South Wales there has been a continuing weak performance by the Carr government, which has deprived tens of thousands of young people and businesses of quality training opportunities. When you look more closely at these cases and ask why commencement numbers are beginning to decline in these Labor states, you find that it is in these states that employers are being faced with mounting paperwork, excessive regulation and duplication. In Queensland, the power of the unions over the training system is being boosted by the Queensland government. In Victoria, under union pressure, employers are being deprived of the opportunity to make a free choice of private or public training providers. In New South Wales, at every turn the Trades and Labour Council has resisted efforts to get rid of outdated regulations and employers have had to wait months to get an apprenticeship registered. This is what happens when Labor comes to power. When Labor comes to power, the self-interests of their union mates overwhelm the interests of businesses in getting quality training and overwhelm the interests of young people in taking on new apprenticeships. They hand the training agenda over to their trade union mates and that starts to put business off the training system. We are now seeing falls occurring in these three states. Of course, that is exactly what happened when the federal Labor Party was in office. When the Leader of the Opposition was training minister, we had a collapse of 20,000 traditional apprenticeships in one year. In 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships reached the lowest proportion of the work force in three decades. If Labor ever gets into power, state or federal, you will find the trade unions having the apprenticeship system handed over to them and you will see numbers begin to decline. For all the rhetoric of a commitment to education, training and skilling up the country, the reality is this: Labor's trade union sectional interests always take priority over the training system. On Friday, when I meet with the training ministers in these states, I will be taking up this issue with ministers to ensure that these extraordinary restrictions that are now being placed on the training system are removed, so that young Australians can once more begin to get the sort of opportunities that this government is dedicated to providing to them. </DOC>

 - I do not have anything to add to what I have said.  -  - You have a very simple situation. The current collection is 44c a litre and the excise is going down - simple. What an incredible revelation! This was going to be the week when they had us on the ropes. The last week before the GST and they have almost an embarrassment of riches. They have petrol, caravans and the natural anticipation of a GST, but this morning they kept bumping into each other at the tactics meeting. Simon said, `I'll get Carmen to ask that wasted question,' which she did, and so it went on. Of course, there is a fall from 44c down to something like 38c a litre because there is a reduction. Nothing alters the fact that the GST compensation has two elements. One of those elements is the straight reduction and the other is the passing on of cost savings. While I am on the subject of cost savings, I just happened to have come across my desk this morning, immediately after the speech on fairness, which I read with enormous interest, scepticism and utter cynicism, which progressed into total disbelief and then ended in gales of laughter at the fact that somebody should have such infernal gall, after participating in 13 years of the most divisive unfairness this country has ever seen -  - What came across my desk immediately after -  - This is tactic number three! - Are you inviting me to finish? - I will come back to this in the next answer, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for that question and for his interest in farmers who require assistance through difficult times. Since 1997 this government has supported farmers in financial difficulty through the Farm Family Restart Scheme. Around 4,000 farmers have benefited from that program. In this year's budget, the government announced that that program would be extended, at a cost of $111 million over four years, to provide enhanced benefits to farmers facing difficulties. The new scheme will be renamed Farm Help - Supporting Families through Change, to better reflect the fact that this scheme overwhelmingly provides short-term assistance to farmers going through difficult periods. The income support under the arrangements will continue as in the past, and around 3,600 people have to date taken advantage of that element of the scheme. Farmers will continue to have access to subsidised professional advice to help them make decisions about the future of their property. This advice will, in future, underpin a new case management approach. In addition, the re-establishment grants - $45,000 tax free - will continue to be available. The assets test will be made a little more generous. In addition, in the future there will be a retraining grant available for farmers who choose to leave agriculture.This is an enhanced program to help farmers in need through difficult times. The good news on the eve of the new tax system is that there will be less need for a program like this in the future because the profitability of the farm sector is expected to improve significantly. The National Farmers Federation have estimated that the new tax system will be worth an average of $7,500 in reduced costs to farmers. Of course, a very significant element of that reduced cost will be in reduced transport costs. The Livestock Transport Association have estimated that, with the lower fuel costs and lower costs on trucks, their freight rates could go down by as much as 15 per cent. The grain industry expect to save $30 million on the reductions in excise for rail transport alone. All of those things provide significant benefits for farmers. Whilst Farm Help will now be less necessary than it has been in the past, this government recognises that there is a need for a special safety net. This new Farm Help program enhances the existing program and guarantees that support will be available whenever a difficult time arises.</DOC>

 - I have not recently read that modelling or indeed the ACCC submission. But let me say that, even if I were to accept the analysis of it by the Leader of the Opposition, I do not think it automatically follows from that that it takes five to 10 years for business to pass on cost savings. That is really what the Leader of the Opposition was arguing, wasn't he? Correct me if I am wrong. I am not misrepresenting him, am I? I would not want to do that, Mr Speaker. What he was asserting - and let us spell this out very carefully - was that that proved that it would take five to 10 years to pass on cost savings. I just happen to have the transcript of an interview in my hand. The interview was carried out yesterday and it was with the managing director of Woolworths.  - `Oh'? He only runs one of the largest retail organisations in the country, and he happens to preside over an organisation that has a lot more day-to-day contact with the consumers of Australia than does the Leader of the Opposition. I will tell you what he had to say. He was asked a question which goes very directly to the point asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition. It is right on it. Not even he could take a point of order on this. The question was:Are you absorbing any of the costs?To which the answer was:Corbett: We are anticipating some of the cost savings that we believe we will get in advance, yes.In other words, what he was saying was that they were going to anticipate costs savings - not in five or 10 years but on 1 July. He then went on to say, in answer to a question about what I understand to be the subject of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, that is, oil companies and petrol:Corbett: Look, I can't make a comment on the oil companies. That's a very complex business and I wouldn't presume to do that. But let me say there are substantial savings for our company in GST. Even our capital budget. We'll save about 10 per cent of our capital budget as a result of  input savings in GST. GST will have a very beneficial effect on the Australian economy because it is stopping the taxing of inputs - Now listen to this:and businesses will have significant savings which will be for the benefit of everyone and as we have said we are committed to passing those on to the consumer.All I can say is that I could not have put it more eloquently myself. I think Mr Corbett speaks for the responsible business community of Australia. All credit to him. There are cost savings. We think they ought to be passed on by all companies, not just some companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I have also been reading the speech of the Leader of the Opposition at Wollongong today with his claims that he supports a fairer system. If you look at the unfair dismissal law, the fact of the matter is that for some people who have to deal with the unfair dismissal law the system is not fair at all. It is certainly not fair to have a system that penalises somebody in small business because they have taken a risk and given somebody a job. It is not fair -  - The Labor Party will not even agree to the unfair dismissal exemption for small business being debated in the Senate and a vote being taken in the Senate. Let us not have this deceit. The Labor Party are opposed to the interests of small business, and the people who pay the price of their subservience to the ACTU are thousands of people who are unemployed who would be gladly given a job by small business if the system was fair for small business. The Labor Party talk about fairness. What about a system that is fair for people who are unemployed and who would like to be given an opportunity by a small business person? The Labor Party today also make it quite clear in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition that they will oppose further legislation to make some sensible changes to the unfair dismissal law. One of the changes that should be made to the unfair dismissal law is in respect of frivolous or speculative claims where in some cases large costs are run up against small businesses, costs which small business cannot afford to pay but which under the current system cannot be required to be met by an applicant who has made an unfair or a speculative claim. In fact, the Industrial Relations Commission, the umpire of the system, has effectively said that there ought to be a change in the law. This is what the commission said in a particular case:We have little doubt that in the civil courts the respondent would have recovered costs against Mr McKenzie and against -   - This is genuinely pathetic, Mr Speaker. The Labor Party -  - Here is a case where the Industrial Relations Commission says there ought to be change because it would make for a fairer system and yet the Labor Party are opposed to that change. That is not fair. The Labor Party support additional powers to the Industrial Relations Commission. The speech this morning said that we ought to support the continued role of the umpire. And, when the umpire says the rules ought to be changed, what do the Labor Party do? They ask the ACTU and the ACTU says no. The fact is that this system in many respects is unfair and changes ought to be made. This has been acknowledged by others, not just the commission. Meg Lees, for example, said:But there is some scope at least to simplify the commission's proceedings to prevent employers being forced to pay hush money to litigious but unworthy employees.Senator Murray said:... we acknowledge that the unfair dismissal laws are to some degree being abused with speculative claims by employees, ...The Democrats said in their policy:Support for a fair balance between the rights of employers and employees (irrespective of the size of the employer) on unfair dismissal claims, with low cost, non-legalistic and prompt resolution of disputes;That was their policy in 1998. I believe that we do need some more reforms to unfair dismissals and this would be of benefit to small business. If it is good for small business, that means many more unemployed people can get a job. The Labor Party, instead of just being totally negative and totally doing what the ACTU says they should do, for once ought to look at an issue on its merits and look at the clear demand for a fairer system. They ought to read what the Industrial Relations Commission as the umpire has said and just for once ought to take a decision based on the interests of ensuring that more people can have a job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his timely question. It was a great pleasure this morning to launch Australia's newest bank, Elders Rural Bank, which is a new bank for a new century. Elders Rural Bank will officially begin operations on 1 July. It has met all the proper banking requirements of the independent banking regulator, APRA, which issued the licence this morning. Elders Rural Bank brings together Futuris, which is the holding company of Elders - a name familiar to many in rural and regional Australia - and Bendigo Bank which, in my view, has done an outstanding job of developing the concept of community banking. These two organisations have a long history of successful enterprise and strong community partnerships in rural and regional Australia. Elders has over 400 outlets in rural and regional Australia, and from 1 July I am advised that banking services will be offered initially through 149 new branches, increasing to 400 branches within two years. This means 149 new bank branches in towns like Hamilton, Longreach, Katherine, Deniliquin, Cooma, Nyngan, Mareeba, Carnarvon, Albany, Kalgoorlie, Kingaroy and Walgett. It means a return to face-to-face banking in up to 30 towns that currently have no bank branches at all. In the member for Hinkler's electorate, it means a new bank branch in Bundaberg. Other members of his electorate will be able to access the bank branch at Gin Gin, which is in the member for Wide Bay's electorate.  Elders Rural Bank has declared agribusiness as its priority so that residents of country Australia will now be able to deposit their savings in a bank that has priority lending for the development of rural and regional Australia. This has been illustrated in the past by Elders's commitment to seasonal working capital for rural producers. With the expert backing of Bendigo Bank's risk management systems, Elders Rural Bank can expand its product range. It was particularly pleasing this morning to hear the Chairman of the new Elders Rural Bank, the Hon. John Dawkins, say that this new bank would not have been possible without the reform of banking undertaken by this government, the Howard government, in 1997. That means that Elders Rural Bank can use the infrastructure of both Elders Rural Services and Bendigo Bank to offer low cost banking in rural Australia. Our reforms are delivering real success stories for rural and regional Australia. It is this government's commitment to reform, it is this government's commitment to picking up Australia and taking it into the 21st century, that is delivering for all Australians a better banking system, a fairer banking system and a banking system that, in this particular case, delivers real benefits to rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I did indicate to the House last week that owners and builders were aware of the fact that there would be a GST impact on houses. They knew that in December 1998. The honourable member has referred to some representations received from constituents which I acted upon appropriately. Let me explain. The constituents that came to see me in respect of a house signed a contract in October 1999. That contract required completion of a home within a particular period of time - from memory, it was a 32-week contract. When my constituents came to see me, that house was at the stage of having a slab poured and half a frame erected. They came to see me after they received a letter from the builder indicating, without any explanation, that there would be an increase in price of just under $12,000. Their complaint to me related to the relationship between them and their builder and the fact that a representative of that builder had indicated to them earlier this year, when discussion came up on the question of what the impact of the GST would be, that the house would be three-quarters complete by 1 July and that the impact would be around $2,000. They received the letter with no explanation and with little progress occurring on their house under their contract. They said to me, `It seems a bit rich that all of a sudden a non-explainable $12,000 increase is now being requested of us, with little progress on the house over all these weeks, when we were told earlier this year that there would be an increase of about $2,000 - which we had accepted.' Those matters were put to the builder in terms of re-examining the amount that had been sent in that letter in the context of the earlier discussions between my constituents and their builder. As I pointed out to my constituents and, from memory, as I pointed out in the letter to the builder, the contract was signed in October 1999, with knowledge they had had since December 1998. In all of those circumstances, I think it was not unreasonable for my constituents to believe that the house would have been substantially complete by the time that the GST impact took effect. They accepted from those discussions that that impact would be about $2,000. I put it to the builder that he might reconsider the amount in those circumstances. I think that goes to the contractual relations between the builder and the owners, and I would suggest that it is entirely appropriate that a concern expressed on delay and on impact to them be taken up by me, as a local member, with the builder. I did that, and I would do that again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for that question, a member who has always displayed a very consistent interest in the welfare of pensioners and retired people in Australia. I am pleased to confirm to the parliament that pensions and allowances will be increased by four per cent from 1 July. In relation to arrangements for paying the increase - and this is important information for the benefit of pensioners in members' constituencies - on the first payday after 1 July, Centrelink will pay the increased pension and allowance entitlements, with the increase backdated to 1 July. On the first payday after 1 July, the Family Assistance Office will pay the increased entitlements under the new family benefits package, with the increase also backdated to 1 July. This arrangement ensures that pensioners and those who receive allowances will be ahead by two per cent more than they would otherwise have been, regardless of the price effect of taxation reform.In other words, the good news for pensioners is that there is a two per cent guaranteed real increase in the level of the pension, the sort of benefit that will be of continuing help, support and security for the pensioners of Australia. As a result of these arrangements, no less than 845,000 part-pensioners will be receiving a higher pension and 45,000 people will qualify for a part pension for the first time as a result of more generous income and assets tests for pensions. In addition to that, there will be special aged persons and savings bonuses in relation to people over 60 years who have income from savings and investment. That is what we promised the pensioners of Australia we would do in 1998 and that is what we are delivering, not only in full but with many significant enhancements since the election in 1998. How does that, I might ask rhetorically, stack up with earlier performances of governments which have said things about pensioners and then, when they have got re-elected, they have not done them? I was unkind enough to have a bit of research done on this, and I found that in 1993, in a document entitled Policies for Older Australians, this is what was said:Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate, as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut-out point. That was in the document called Policies for Older Australians issued for the 1993 election. On 18 March 1993, only five days after the election, the Labor government announced that it would not be keeping its commitment to remove all age and service pensions from the tax system by 1995. The commitment was estimated to be worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. Just listen to the explanation given by the then Treasurer: Look, that is something which of course the Government would want to review. We haven't given any definite undertakings - hang on, I thought they said they were going to remove it by 1995 - and I think it was an undertaking given at a much earlier stage.It had in fact been given only a few months earlier. He continues:It is certainly not an undertaking we have renewed and I certainly don't feel under any obligation to follow through with it.On 19 March, incredibly enough, this is what the Australian Financial Review had to say: `Labor advisers say the commitment was included in the policy platform by mistake.' I cannot imagine that the Financial Review, or indeed any other paper, would allow some adviser of this government to get away with such a phoney explanation or phoney excuse. The reality is that 1993 and the months that followed that notorious election represent one of the worst litanies of deceit, broken promises and dishonesty on the part of a government and on the part of a serving prime minister that this country has seen. Not only did they promise tax cuts, not only did they attack our indirect tax package, but immediately on being re-elected they repudiated their promises to the pensioners, they repudiated their promises to the taxpayers of Australia and, to add insult to injury, they increased the price of petrol by 6c a litre without warning and without any compensation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. Can I indicate that in my answer to the first question today I could have added that many of those facts were brought to my attention by the Domaine building company in responding to me in respect of those representations I made on behalf of my constituent. As I indicated to the House last week, there was a knowledge of the impact of GST from December 1998. There is a transitional period in everything. But let me simply say this: the benefit of GST goes to the states. I would have thought that the honourable member for Werriwa would have an open door to the Premier of New South Wales in view of his former occupation. I wonder if he has gone to the Premier of New South Wales, who will be the beneficiary of the GST in respect of home building and everywhere else, or perhaps to the Labor Premier of Victoria, and asked those premiers if they have the concern and are they prepared to forgo the benefits that will flow to them, because they will receive the GST? It goes to the states.  - I am sure the honourable member for Werriwa would have noted that in contracts that most builders have issued to owners for some significant time - in fact since December 1998 - there was a provision to say that any impact of any taxes or otherwise would be applicable, and there is an impact the other way in respect of certain things that go into homes, particularly in the final stages. The one certainty is that when it comes to midnight on Friday the iniquitous, inequitable wholesale sales tax ceases - it goes - and there will be some flow-on in respect of that to homebuilders as well.

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for a question that goes to the heart of one of the great achievements of this government; that is, not only has there been a reduction in the number of industrial disputes but there has been a dramatic increase in real wages over the last 4¼ years. When the alleged workers' party, the Labor Party, were in office, they drove real wages down and they boasted about it. Over the last 4¼ years, this government, through its industrial relations policy and other policies, has presided over a significant increase in the wages of Australian workers. That is something you never hear the member for Brisbane or the Leader of the Opposition telling gatherings of the trade union movement. You never hear them say that over the last 4¼ years workers have received a double benefit from this government. They have low interest rates and higher wages. That is a double which no government has delivered in 30 or 40 years. It is a double which eluded the 13 years of Keating and Hawke and it is a double that has been delivered to the workers of Australia by the coalition government. One of the reasons it has been delivered is that we have pursued policies to provide more flexibility to Australia's labour markets. It is a matter of public record that, if Labor wins the next election, it will reverse that process. In the nature of the democratic contest, it is always important from time to time to have a look not only at what the government is saying and doing but also at what the opposition is saying and doing. We read a little bit about what was being said and done in the Labor caucus yesterday morning.  - The report on your caucus meeting was far more colourful. I think it was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who, at one stage, was actually yelling at people from the Left. He was saying to them that they had only raised that particular argument so that it could be leaked. - Mr Speaker, in the natural banter of things, I responded to a vigorous interjection by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but that does not prevent me from returning to the central issue raised, and that is productivity. When you have flexible labour markets, you have greater productivity.  When you have flexible labour markets, you go ahead. The member for Macquarie asked me whether there is any evidence for that proposition from prominent economic experts. I have a speech in front of me which was delivered by a person by the name of Alan Greenspan. Most people would regard him as a fairly prominent economic expert. He would know something about flexible labour markets. It would be a very good idea if the Labor Party took a bit of notice. When Alan Greenspan was talking about the relative performances of economies, he said: Europe and Japan have participated in this recent wave of invention and innovation and have full access to the newer technologies. However, they arguably have been slower to apply them. The relatively inflexible and hence more costly labour markets of these economies appear to be an important factor.What that means is that, if you want to really get the benefit of technology, you have to have a flexible approach to labour market regulation. That is what this government has followed; that is what the governments of most European countries have not followed. One of the reasons why the Japanese economy has grown at a slower pace than the United States economy over the past few years is that the Japanese have been slow to provide greater flexibility to their labour markets. Everything that we have heard from the opposition - from the Leader of the Opposition, from the member for Brisbane and from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - is all about bringing back greater inflexibility into the labour market. It is all about re-regulating labour.  It is all about giving greater authority to the union. It is all about putting unions above the law through effectively destroying the secondary boycott prohibition. What this will really do is put at risk the gains that have been made on the productivity front over the last 4¼ years.  It is no accident that Australian workers are better off now than they were in March 1996. They are better off now because the policies of this government have led to a reduction in interest rates, the policies of this government have boosted productivity and the policies of this government have boosted the pay packets of Australian workers.  Every utterance of the Australian Labor Party on this issue, if given effect to, would set into reverse that highly desirable process.</DOC>

 - If my memory serves me correctly, the member who asked the question was either the secretary of the Queensland branch of the ALP at the time of the 1993 election or in fact stood as a candidate at that election. In either event, it is beyond comprehension how, in the light of Dawkins's repudiation of your 1993 promise to Australian pensioners, you would have the nerve to ask such a stupid question. The reality is that the commitment we are making to the pensioners of Australia is being honoured in full - and you know it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have noticed that the ACTU Congress has now adopted as a policy that we should see an effective doubling in superannuation contributions by employers to 15 per cent. My concern about the adoption of this policy by the ACTU is that we all know that when the ACTU adopts a policy it will not be long before the leadership of the ALP does so as well. We have already seen the `world's greatest Treasurer', Mr Keating, on the 15 per cent push as well. It is quite clear that, despite the protestations of the frontbench on the other side, there is a gathering momentum for a very significant increase in contributions which would mean a very significant increase in costs on business. You do not need to be a Rhodes scholar or an economist to understand the ultimate impact of that. You do not need to understand much about running a business to know that, if you have a very significant increase in costs, that will mean a reduction in employment. That is the last thing that we ought to be advocating in this country. It is a policy that should be immediately repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition. But, when it comes to standing up to the ACTU, we all know that that is not something he is easily capable of. The fact is that this will drive people out of the work force. It will increase costs on business. It is like the introduction of a new tax. Labor's policy is already to introduce a new tax to fund the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme. A significant increase now in superannuation would see a lot of people lose their jobs and a lot of employment opportunities lost in the Australian economy.The ACTU are clearly very confident of their capacity to push around the Leader of the Opposition. The language of the ACTU really gives you a sense of the way in which the ACTU control the leadership and in particular the Leader of the Opposition. Sharan Burrow treats the Leader of the Opposition like a pet poodle. She has the pet poodle on her lap and she is belting it around the ears and then she says, `We know he is happy to take that flak and he'll wear a lot more and he'll wear it like a badge of honour' - like any good poodle would! This is not in the interests of Australian workers. This will cost Australian workers their jobs. It is yet another example of how the Leader of the Opposition cannot stand up to the trade union movement. As it marches to the left, destroying thousands of jobs, the Leader of the Opposition again fails to stand up for the national interest and for the jobs of ordinary Australian workers.</DOC>

 - The government has always been very clear in explaining the savings bonuses to pensioners right around this country. It was very clear that pensioners who had income from savings of up to $20,000 could be eligible for the $1,000 bonus and that from $20,000 to $30,000, depending on their income, the bonus would alter. This was part of the generous compensation package that the government put in place to ensure that when there were price rises as a result of the new taxation system they would be compensated. This was never done by the Australian Labor Party when they increased wholesale sales taxes from 10 per cent to 12 per cent or from 20 to 22 per cent and to 34 per cent. These are measures that have been put into place, along with, as the Prime Minister said, the four per cent increase and along with raising the assets test level by 2.5 per cent to ensure that they are well-off and ahead in the new tax system. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. Yesterday I informed the House about the record number of new apprentices in training as a result of the government's training reforms, but I also advised the House of the alarming drop-off in commencements in the Labor states, particularly in Victoria where commencements have fallen by 10.9 per cent since December last year, and in Queensland where commencements have fallen by 29.3 per cent since June last year. I should also mention that the Carr government has been a consistent poor performer within the framework of the apprenticeship system, with New South Wales missing some 30,000 apprenticeship and traineeship places which it would have if participation were at Victorian levels - the levels achieved by the Kennett government.The problem is that Labor is consistently seeking ways to give privileges to its union mates, to shore up its main bases of support, and to put in place more and more bureaucracy. In Victoria, despite the fact that employers want choice of public or private training provider, under union pressure the Victorian government has capped the number of places that private training providers can offer. We have seen that, as a result, the Victorian commencements have dropped almost 11 per cent since December last year. The New South Wales system is being strangled by the union unwillingness to get rid of the declaration of a vocation system which is excessively bureaucratic. The Queensland government is making it increasingly difficult for employers to take on new apprentices by adding extra entry forms into the system.I understand the Tasmanian government is now providing political funding to the Trades and Labour Council in that state so that that council can promote union membership amongst trainees and apprentices. We are seeing constantly the efforts of the Labor Party to shore up its own political base at the expense of quality training and real jobs for young Australians. What there is is an effort to maintain a railway gauge approach to training on the part of the states. National companies like Woolworths, Ford, Coles, Brambles, BP and Amcor are increasingly expressing their frustration at the poor business practices of the states and the fact that the Labor states are making apprenticeships more and more unfriendly to small, medium sized and national businesses. Ford, for example, says:Inconsistencies and bureaucratic nonsense are creating a stifling effect. We need one system, not eight.That is why I am putting forward national model legislation for apprenticeships - so that we can get some uniformity into the system and meet the needs of national businesses to provide this quality training. These issues require strong and immediate action by the states. I have taken this up with the states and on Friday, when I meet with the state ministers, I will be actively pursuing with them the need to get rid of these bureaucratic blockers that they have put in place. The problem is that whenever Labor comes to power, be it federal Labor or state Labor, its efforts to give privileges to its union mates inevitably start biting into the willingness of employers to offer quality training to apprentices. This is a tragedy. It is what would happen if Labor ever came to power nationally. We are now seeing it happen across the states where a Labor government has come to power. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity to inform the House that I have today referred Westpac to the ACCC for investigation of the pricing nominations made on the front of one of today's papers. I also point out to the House - and I think every member of the House and every bank customer should be aware of this - that the original ANTS package taken to the last election was based on the abolition of $2.46 billion in financial services taxes, which the Labor Party opposed at every single point. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of taxes on financial institutions duty. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of debits tax. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on business conveyances. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on leases. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on mortgages or loan securities. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on bonds and debentures. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on credit arrangements. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on instalment purchase agreements. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duty on rental and hiring arrangements. As I say, in each case when it comes to bank fees and charges, I urge bank customers to shop around.  -  - The opposition scoff at my remark about shopping around. I ask the opposition - who said this:Once again, the Price Watch team have shown how important it is for consumers to shop around for specials.Who said that? Who would that be? Who said this:The Price Watch team's latest results reinforce what I have been encouraging shoppers to do for a long time - shop around.Who said that? Which member of the Labor Party said that? - Mr Speaker, I ask the question - who said this:'Our surveys have shown customer loyalty is rarely rewarded. If people really want to save themselves money and are operating on a tight budget, they need to shop at the store with the most specials to suit their needs,' Mr Swan said.The member for Lilley is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but on this occasion he is right on the money.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. The government is certainly aware of attempts to introduce laws that have the effect of taking a small business person and declaring them to be an employee at the request of a union. This proposal is in fact now Labor Party policy. We know that because I launched the policy myself in the parliament this week. Item 75 of that policy says:The protection of the IR system should be extended beyond a narrow definition of employees to include more in employment type relations. We know what this means, because the Labor government in Queensland have actually made this the law. In Queensland, you can be a small business person and, by Queensland law, a tribunal can come along, at the request of a union, and - hey-presto! - one minute you thought you were a small business person, the next minute you are an employee. The consequence of that is that as an employee you become subject to awards, union preference clauses and all the privileged arrangements which suit the union movement.What is particularly concerning about this is that we have a trade union movement whose membership in the private sector work force is now down to 20 per cent and, because it cannot get members by attracting them through good service, it is using the Labor Party to dragoon people into the trade union movement. This is a means of just frogmarching people into the trade union movement's clutches at the behest of a weak opposition leader and a weak Labor Party. In Queensland this has become law. In New South Wales, the government have introduced a bill to do exactly the same thing. In Victoria, Ron McCallum has a panel going around for the Labor government, and you can be sure that he has written this clause already. Why? Because the trade union leadership demand it of the parliamentary party. When you have a weak leader, as we have here federally, you can be absolutely certain this will be part and parcel of a bill to be introduced by Labor if they are ever elected.The consequences go beyond that. If they take somebody who is minding their own business, running their own business, and suddenly declare them to be an employee, look the consequence of this for the building industry. What incredible hypocrisy! The Labor Party are talking about costs in the building industry. If you take the tremendous number of small businesses in the building sector who build residential dwellings for Australians at low cost and high quality - one of the great industry sectors in this country - and turn them into employees and let the unions run that system, what do you think that will do to the cost of housing in Australia? It will send it through the roof, literally. Why? Because of the union leadership demand of weak leaders like the Leader of the Opposition that they get a privileged position.Lastly, and just to show how draconian this is, there are people such as Steve Harrison, a former leading union official who is now publicly opposed to this proposal because he knows it is so draconian. In fact, ultimately, it is against the interests of the trade union movement. They ought to be out there attracting members on the basis of delivering a good service, instead of frogmarching people into the union using laws put in place by the weak leaders of a parliamentary party, such as the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I have not had any discussions with Professor Fels about this matter at all. Therefore I cannot be absolutely certain as to what assumptions Professor Fels has in mind when he makes these statements. But the situation in relation to petrol excise is well known. It has been explained. The Labor Party is endeavouring, as it has with just about every other popular commodity, to create the circumstances of fear, concern and confusion. What we have done is deliver a cut in excise of 6.7c. When you add to that the cost savings, which we believe should be passed on in full by the oil companies, we believe, as I have said on a number of occasions in the House -  - I can only repeat what I have said on a number of occasions - that is, we have delivered a reduction of 6.7c a litre. There are cost savings in relation to the sale of petrol, and we believe those cost savings should be passed on in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in Melbourne Standard and Poor's released a commentary on the health insurance industry and, during a press conference, Mr Ian Thompson from Standard and Poor's made the comment that he expected premiums to rise by 10 per cent next year. I note that, on ABC Radio National this morning, the same Mr Thompson made the comment:Quite frankly, I think, you know, some of the comments, you know, were perhaps a bit over the top.Mr Thompson's comments were certainly over the top. This same Mr Thompson, in a conversation with a senior management person in a major Australian health fund, commented today that he had said that because he thought it would be helpful to the industry. Unfortunately, it has caused anxiety among a very large number of Australians. It is quite an extraordinary assertion given that, this year, health premium increases were the lowest for at least 20 years - premium increases were under two per cent on average. Given the success of Lifetime Health Cover, this actually put downward pressure on premiums compared with the last 12 months, and there have been recent statements by the Australian Health Insurance Association that people can look forward to a long period where premiums are not expected to rise substantially. The government's own fund, Medibank Private, has said that if there is a premium increase next year it will be somewhere between nothing and a tiny amount.The Standard and Poor's report fails on several accounts. It fails to recognise that 40 out of 44 health funds are not for profit. It fails to recognise that, unlike general insurance, health insurance is not risk rated. Last year my department pointed out to Standard and Poor's a number of factual errors in their first report and offered to provide comment on this year's report. That offer was knocked back and the same errors appear in this year's statement. The information in this report is 12 months old. Because it was publicly available information, it does not take into account the substantially better performance of the funds this year. On 1 March next year premium increases will be announced for the year 2001. At that point I expect an apology from Mr Thompson, and his other clients can determine the competence and accuracy of his company. </DOC>

 - As I said in answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I am quite unable to put myself into the mind of the Chairman of the ACCC, because I have not discussed this matter with him. The Leader of the Opposition returned to the question of the total amount of Commonwealth excise collections. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the current excise collected by the Commonwealth on unleaded petrol is 44.13c, and it will fall to 37.48c under the new arrangements. In those circumstances, I fail to see the logical basis of the leader's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I am sure that the member for Parramatta, like all members of this House, will be very pleased that, over the past 12 months, unemployment in the Sydney metropolitan region has dropped from over six per cent to under five per cent, despite an increase in the participation rate. Over the past 12 months, 50,000 new jobs have been created in the Sydney region. Since March 1996, 180,000 new jobs have been created in the Sydney metropolitan region.Earlier this year, SOCOG estimated that there would be nearly 100,000 paid jobs created, directly and indirectly, thanks to the Sydney Olympics and Paralympics. At the same time, there are about 100,000 registered job seekers in the Sydney region. Not all of these people can be expected to fill Olympic jobs, but the Olympics obviously provide Sydney with a once in a lifetime opportunity to drive unemployment down toward levels last seen in the 1950s and 1960s. Earlier this year, the government launched an Olympic employment site as part of the Australian Jobsearch service available to job seekers on touch screens around Australia and through the Internet. With just one click, job seekers can enter the exciting world of Olympic job opportunities. Today there are nearly 2,000 jobs available on this site and, like all Job Network services, this is available absolutely free to job seekers. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you, like all members of this House, would encourage job seekers to make the most of Olympic opportunities. I would certainly encourage all employers to give job seekers a fair go in competing for available Olympic jobs.I have been asked about alternative approaches. The New South Wales Labour Council has set up an Olympic labour exchange, and it proposes charging all successful job seekers a $6 a week levy for getting a job under this system. This is Labor's tax on jobs. It is Labor's GST on jobs - a `gold' in Sydney tax on jobs. There have been suggestions that the government is being too harsh on job seekers by expecting them to make the most of Olympic job opportunities. Let me just say that the cruelest thing you can do for job seekers is to encourage them to stay on welfare. The kindest thing you can do is to encourage them to take jobs, and that is precisely what this government is doing.  </DOC>

 - That question must have been written by Chris from Waramanga.  - Alby wrote it! - I think what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was pointing out to the House is the extreme volatility in petrol prices. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, the new tax system does not commence until one minute past midnight on Saturday morning, but I was informed that today, in the same capital city, there were fluctuations in petrol prices of 9c a litre. That points out the volatility. As I pointed out to the House the other day, the government has an indexation twice a year, as the Labor government did. The indexation effect in February of this year was 0.65c per litre. Within three days in Melbourne, the price increased by 10c a litre. That was because the oil company had withdrawn its subsidies. It had withdrawn the measures it had taken to make competition vary between one company and the other, and as a result there was a wild fluctuation in price. It was nothing to do with taxes, whether they be the taxes of today, the taxes of Saturday, or taxes from that point onwards.  - You are not talking to Anthony Albanese when you fire out that sort of rude interjection. You are not talking to the Left of the Labor Party now, Simon, so just settle for a moment. Mr Speaker, I point out once again that the taxes of today have nothing to do with the volatility that will apply in that particular industry. This government has stated clearly that it expects the savings that the industry will achieve under the new tax system to be passed on to the motorists, and it expects that to happen from one minute past midnight on Saturday morning. If that is not the case, the watchdog, the ACCC, will do what is necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Commonwealth government has allocated more than $56 million over three years to the ACCC to assist it with its price monitoring functions as a result of the transition to the new taxation system. At its peak, over the next 10 days, the ACCC will have more than 2,000 people working on price monitoring, either through the ACCC itself or through its contractors. This is the most extensive price monitoring and consumer protection regime ever undertaken during the transition to a new taxation system, outside of price control in Great Britain and a price freeze in Belgium, Korea and the Netherlands.Unlike other GST implementation programs around the world, the ACCC has covered all means of assisting consumers and business. In relation to indicative prices, the ACCC has printed eight million everyday shopping guides which have been mailed to 6.7 million households. They are still available in post offices and newsagents around Australia. The ACCC has distributed a further 760,000 leaflets with facts for consumers to households, and that material is being translated into six different languages, including Italian, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, Arabic and Greek. The ACCC's hotline, 1300 302 502, has received more than 78,000 calls to date, mostly about pricing inquiries. Despite the best endeavours of the Labor Party, the ACCC has conducted an advertising campaign to tell consumers the phone number. The ACCC is also providing extensive advice to business. They have distributed more than 3,400,000 booklets and fact sheets to businesses, as well as 200,000 small business pricing kit CDs. In addition, the ACCC has held 90 seminars around Australia. In relation to the price monitoring of individual goods and services, Australia's competition watchdog is monitoring more than three million prices on 1,000 goods at between 8,000 and 9,000 different sites around Australia. The ACCC is also considering approving public compliance commitments from business. These public agreements between the ACCC and businesses cannot be used by business to claim an exemption from the full force of the law. The ACCC is agreeing to pricing methodology, but it is not signing off on individual prices. I reissue a warning to business: if they try to exploit consumers during the transition to the new taxation system, they may be liable for fines of up to $10 million for corporations and $500,000 for individuals.This regime that we have put in place is delivered by enforcement. There have been 763 completed matters since January this year, and a further 522 active matters are being investigated. Legal remedies so far have included an exploitation notice being issued, nine court enforceable undertakings and 30 voluntary undertakings made between the ACCC and those businesses. This price monitoring regime that the government has put in place, backed up by very significant powers under the Trade Practices Act, is delivering results. In the first two surveys after the first reduction in wholesale sales tax on consumer goods, it was found that, at a retail level, higher than expected benefits were passed through to consumers. The ACCC is doing an excellent job of protecting consumers, and it enjoys the full support of this government.</DOC>

 - The Chief Opposition Whip has asked me a question about the petrol grants scheme, and it gives me an opportunity -  - I do not specifically know the price. I am quite sure that the Chief Opposition Whip does not carry it around in his head either. No doubt the tactics committee said, `We'll give Leo Nyngan'. The issue that the Chief Opposition Whip raises is the generosity and the fairness of the government's grants scheme. I remind the Chief Opposition Whip that the grants scheme goes far beyond the commitments that were made by the coalition during the election campaign. We have heard an enormous amount over the last three days about allegations that, in relation to petrol, we have not matched the commitments we made. The reality is that there was no grants scheme promised in the election campaign. The grants scheme was something additional that the government funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. I know that oppositions have a licence to be utterly irresponsible - and this opposition is exercising the freedom of that licence to the ultimate degree - but there does come a point, when you ask questions which imply, in effect, that the government should be spending more money, when those in the opposition who ask those sorts of questions -  - In fact, there was no grants scheme promised during the election campaign. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as always, provides helpful interjections. There was no grants scheme promised during the election campaign. The reality is that the grants scheme very generously assists people in non-metropolitan Australia in relation to the price of petrol. In order to get some kind of perspective back into this debate about the price of petrol, I would remind the Chief Opposition Whip that this country has the third cheapest petrol in the world. If you were in the United Kingdom you would be paying the equivalent of something like $1.70 a litre. If you were in Japan you would be paying $1.40 or $1.50.  - I know the interjector likes to go to France a lot. They tell me that in Bordeaux it is the equivalent of about $1.90 a litre. The grants scheme is a very appropriate and, I believe, very generous scheme to compensate country people in relation to some of the price differential that exists between city and non-city petrol prices. It is a grants scheme to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It has been widely welcomed by people in Nyngan. It has been widely welcomed by people throughout the length and breadth of non-metropolitan Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know of his concern for his older constituents and those who need residential aged care in his electorate. I am pleased to say that, last Saturday, we advertised for more than 14,000 new residential aged care places and community aged care package places Australia wide. Together with last year's allocation, that makes 22,000 new places that have become available for allocation in the last two years. I remind the House that in 1986 the Labor Party set a benchmark of having 100 places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over. They never once met that benchmark. With our allocation of 22,000 new places, we will make up what the Auditor-General found in 1996 was a deficit left by the Labor Party of 10,000 places. That meant that the Labor Party short-changed older Australians by 10,000 aged care places which they failed to provide. With our 22,000 new places we will make up that deficit and provide for growth. Since coming to office, we have increased our expenditure on aged care. The last Labor Party budget for residential aged care was $2.5 billion. In this current budget we are spending $3.8 billion - an increase of $1.3 billion. This is evidence of the commitment we have made to older Australians and their need for residential aged care and community aged care packages. We are meeting the benchmark that was set by the Labor Party - a benchmark which they never met, We are, in fact, making up the shortfall and providing for growth.</DOC>

 - I repeat what I have said on earlier occasions: at present -  -   - I repeat what I have said on earlier occasions: that is, at present, total Commonwealth excise collections are in the order of 44c a litre. Those collections are based on a certain set of Commonwealth-state financial relations. As the Leader of the Opposition and the members of the opposition frontbench know, those Commonwealth-state financial relations will change dramatically as from Saturday when the new revenue sharing arrangements come into operation whereby the states receive the full proceeds of the GST revenue. In those circumstances - and I say this very directly in answer to all of the questions that have been asked by the opposition on this revenue comparison point - if the current collections of 44-odd cents a litre are based on a certain set of arrangements and those arrangements, as they unarguably will, totally change on Saturday, then the only basis of comparison is the total Commonwealth excise collections. As everybody knows, those total Commonwealth excise collections will fall - </DOC>

 - This question is in the true newspaper following style of the Labor Party, based on a report in the Sydney Morning Herald about freedom of information. The documents released to the Sydney Morning Herald do not shed any further light on this issue - no further light at all. There was contact between my office and the administrator of National Textiles. There is nothing unusual about that. It has happened in relation to Oakdale and other matters. It is entirely consistent with that practice. It remains the case the Labor Party is unhappy that we bailed out ordinary Australian workers. Nothing that you can say is going to alter that fact. Through the good officers of the workers' friend, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business - the battlers' mate behind me here - we have been able to put in place a scheme, and your crowd in New South Wales are too mean to supplement it.</DOC>

 - I would like to inform the House and the Australian people of something new - there will be a change to our tax system on Saturday. This is a generational change that this country has needed for at least a quarter of a century. It is a change that will immeasurably strengthen the Australian economy. It is a change that will reduce the income tax burden of every Australian taxpayer. It is a change that will reduce business costs. It is a change that will reduce the cost of fuel in country Australia because it will reduce diesel by 24c a litre.There is one thing about which the Australian public can be of no doubt - and it will have a very important influence in defining the long-term impact of this change politically, as well as economically and socially - the people who have fought against very difficult odds on many occasions to bring Australia the tax reform it so badly needed are the members of the Liberal and National parties. We are the people who have fought for the national interest. We are the people who have taken the risks. We are the people who have been prepared to confront the generational need for taxation reform. It will forever be to the credit of the Liberal and National parties that they fought to put in place a taxation system which will guarantee, in a way that no other national government has ever guaranteed, the necessary revenue to the states of Australia so that they can fund the roads, the schools, the police, the hospitals and all the other daily services that Australians have a right to expect from their state governments. Everybody in this parliament knows that the premiers conferences, whether under Malcolm Fraser's prime ministership, Bob Hawke's prime ministership, Paul Keating's prime ministership or my own, degenerate into ridiculous wrangling and farcical exchanges. Decade after decade, premiers have come to Canberra and said, `We want a new financial deal.' Prime Minister after Prime Minister has shirked the responsibility of giving them that new deal. That dereliction of responsibility ended with this government. We took a decision two years ago to give the states of Australia a better financial deal. Despite the political posturing of the Labor premiers, they have welcomed it with great glee and great alacrity because it will give them the financial sinews of war they do not now have. I look forward with keen anticipation to Saturday. I look forward to the weeks and months that follow. The Leader of the Opposition cannot make up his mind whether it will be instantaneous disaster or a slow burn. At the beginning of the year, the world was going to come to an end on 1 July, but a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition said that 1 July would be the best day.I say in this parliament to the people of Australia, as I will say to them tonight in my address to the nation, that we have taken this decision because we believe it will strengthen the Australian nation. It will make us a stronger economy. It will make us more competitive. It will give us a fairer taxation system. It will deliver the revenue underpinning for the states to provide essential services. It will end an archaic wholesale sales tax system. Overall, this represents the biggest beneficial change that a government can make to the economy of Australia. I invite the Australian people to give it their support, to give it the fair go it deserves. I have no doubt that, when we return in six or seven weeks time, it will begin to dawn on the Australian Labor Party that there is a point at which the Australian people will tolerate negativity and scaremongering no more. All the Labor Party has done is engage in absolutely destructive negativity. That is easy. You have had your easy hits. You have had your salad days in attacking it. From Saturday it will start to turn around, and the Australian people will realise the courage that this government has displayed. The Australian people will over time embrace the change that has been made. Before I conclude this answer, I would like to place on the record my particular thanks to all of my colleagues for the help they have given me. Most particularly I want to single out for special praise the work of the Treasurer, who has done an absolutely fantastic job in relation to this. He is vastly into detail. The personal commitment he has given to it has been absolutely exemplary. I record my gratitude to my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party and Treasurer of Australia. </DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member for Calwell's question, let me outline that I made the announcement two days ago that, after due consideration of the claims of those who had arrived unlawfully in Australia - which, I might say, took longer than I would have liked, but was hampered very much by the fact that before they arrived in Australia many of them had disposed of documentation that might have assisted us in dealing with those issues - many had been found to have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country and no other protection available to them. That puts them in the same situation as some 14 million other people around the world who have been found to be refugees. There is in Australia a very generous program - in fact, the largest program in the world per capita - to assist refugees with resettlement in Australia. Those places, which we allocate in concert with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, go to people who are judged to be in the most deserving situation, where they have no prospect of returning home, no safe place to stay and have an immediate and compelling need for resettlement. Those who come to Australia unlawfully, often bypassing situations in which they can be safe -  - The point I was making is this. It might satisfy the honourable member for Calwell to know that some of the people who arrive in Australia unlawfully may later be found to be a refugee and then have a lawful entitlement to be here, but that does not mean that they did not arrive in Australia unlawfully. These people came to Australia unlawfully, bypassing other situations in which they could be safe, in many circumstances leaving situations where they had already been safe and have denied people who have a compelling need for a refugee place of that opportunity. We cannot walk away from our international obligations, but to leave in place incentives that would encourage people to come here, at risk to their own lives and at great danger and great cost, would, on our part, be highly irresponsible. One of the significant pull factors for people who were thinking about engaging upon those journeys to Australia was the fact that they got a permanent resident outcome if they were found to be refugees under the arrangements that were in place before. That was the outcome. Now they get a temporary entry permit, which honours our international obligation. Temporary entry holders do not get a family reunion entitlement. They do not get an Australian travel document to come and go from Australia at will, which numbers of permanent entry holders have been prepared to do, even though they were found to be refugees. The parliament agreed that the rules in relation to people who arrive unlawfully and establish refugee status should change and it was to reduce the pull factors to make Australia a less attractive destination. To unwind those measures now would only serve to send a signal to those people who are engaged in this insidious people trafficking business - the same sorts of people we saw involved in that practice in the United Kingdom - to continue to profiteer from this gruesome trade. We will not be a party to unwinding the measures that are designed to deal with that issue.</DOC>

 - I say to my colleague and friend the member for Farrer that the short answer to the question is no, but I know the honourable member would be a tad disappointed if I were so dismissive. Let me simply expand a bit by recalling what I said in answer to the first question, that we will go away for six or seven weeks and, when we all come back, the new system will be in operation. Of course, another event will occur while we are aware, that is, the biennial National Conference of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party will have a great opportunity to work out what its alternative taxation policy is. No doubt when we return the Leader of the Opposition will unveil, during his numerous matters of public importance, why it is that the Australian people should embrace the alternative policy of the ALP. They criticise and obstruct what we try to do for the sake of a vote but not for the sake of the country. They say they are going to roll back the GST, but they do not specify where and how. They propose changes, but they do say that in essence they are going to keep the GST.The new taxation system will move Australia forward in a quite significant way. The kind of rolling back that Labor propose will only add complexity and difficulty to the new system. Over the last two years, the Labor Party have attacked the government in a quite mindless and opportunistic way. We had an outstanding example of it this morning. There is an allegation that a hacker has entered one of the systems associated with the introduction of the new system. What does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do? In that true, national interest style for which he is renowned, does he go on radio and say, `Notwithstanding my opposition to the government's policy, I denounce the illegal practice of hacking'? Oh, no. He immediately says, `Oh, this is another opportunity to belt the government. This is another opportunity to blame it on the government.' That is absolutely and completely irresponsible and it is completely of a piece with the opportunistic attitude that this opposition, particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has taken.It is easy to criticise, it is easy to obstruct and it is easy to point score, but it is a lot harder to present generational taxation reform. When we return after the six- or seven-week break, I am quite certain that every member on this side of the House will look forward with great interest to hearing from the Leader of the Opposition his alternative plan. I have no doubt that they will discuss it at their national conference. They will have all the geniuses of the Labor Party gathered in Hobart. They will have all of their advisers. They will have their outgoing national president, although I think most of us over here rather like Barry in preference to Della Bosca. We will be waiting with bated breath to hear the new policy. When the Leader of the Opposition comes back, we will have our plan, endorsed by the people and introduced against great odds, pitted against their alternative and the Australian people will watch that debate with intense interest. If it is conducted in a spirited, constructive fashion, it can only be for the benefit of the Australian community. </DOC>

 - I do not normally share my social plans with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but it is an interesting suggestion. I have had quite a lot of offers as far as Saturday is concerned. I am sure I will have an opportunity to savour some of the local brew. I am rather pleased that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question because only yesterday the Australian Hotels Association released their recommended prices. I read a report in the Adelaide Advertiser of a lady running a hotel in Glenelg. The thrust of what she had to say was, `Oh, gee, we have seen the AHA price lists and they are nowhere near as bad as we were told.' I wonder who told them they were worse than what they have turned out to be. It would not be Simon, would it?Government members - No. - No! Isn't that uncharitable of him? In other words, the Australian Hotels Association has not only caught Simon out telling whoppers -  - Not only was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to give him his formal title, caught telling whoppers and porkies on this subject but it also has a tad dented the credibility of the breweries in Australia, which have been running these ads and making all sorts of shameful allegations about the Treasurer, not to say the absolutely absurd allegations they have been making about me. - What the AHA price list says, interestingly enough, is that price increases were significantly below the claims being made by the breweries and significantly below the claims being made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. What the lady running the hotel in Glenelg said was, `I cannot understand what all the fuss is about. The customers are really quite happy.' She said, `This thing will come and go,' without so much as a blink in the drinking habits of her patrons. The good news for them is that the prices have not gone up by as much as the Labor Party has scared them into believing. Fancy scaring the working men and women of Australia into believing that beer would go up by more than it will in reality. What an absolutely outrageous thing for the Australian Labor Party to do. Not only is beer not going up by the amount of eight or nine per cent that they talked about but also the working men and women of Australia will have additional dollars in their pockets to buy even more beers. I have no doubt that beer sales in Australia will be completely uninterrupted by the arrival of the new taxation system. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that the ABS job vacancies, which were released today, rose another two per cent in seasonally adjusted terms for the June quarter. That followed a 9.3 per cent growth in the last quarter. The skill vacancy survey, also released today, showed that skill vacancies rose by 1.5 per cent in June and are 15.8 per cent higher than a year ago. The unemployment rate is forecast by the government to fall to around 6¼ per cent by June of next year. This is the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. Since the coalition came to office, around 712,000 new jobs have been created. So far this year, 100,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. The exceptional performance of the Australian economy has been recognised internationally. In its recent report, the meeting of the OECD, which represents the developed countries of the world, identified Australia and five other countries as the countries which were performing the best and which had increased their growth rates in the 1990s over and above the 1980s. It also found that Australia was showing the signs of a new economy. The signs of a new economy include a lift in productivity performance which allows an increase in growth without setting off inflationary forces. The new economy is fuelled by new, more productive ways of doing business, not just by improvements in information and communication technology but by the way in which they move back into the real economy, giving a productivity boost in so-called old industries as well, like agriculture and mining, which are now beginning to see the benefits of those changes.We have, in 36 hours, the opportunity to have a new tax system in this country. In 36 hours we will abolish wholesale sales tax. In 36 hours we will have the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. In 36 hours family assistance will be boosted. In 36 hours there will be a new Commonwealth-state financial arrangement. These are the changes which will drive Australia forward, which will give it the opportunity to boost its productivity and which will give it the opportunity to harness the factors and the opportunities which are in front of it. There is still strong growth in the Australian economy, strong opportunity for growth and strong opportunity for new jobs, which this government wants to see created.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know all about the expensive imported ones, Mr Speaker. I have been saying for six months, 12 months, 18 months, that on Saturday the price of some things will go up, the price of some things will come down and the price of some things will remain the same. There is nothing unexpected about that. This is the last day and I thought, `Gee, they'll have something unexpected. They'll have a rabbit-killer today.' And all he does is steal one of my best lines. I really cannot believe it. He is slipping. Maybe the long, drawn-out campaign of negativism has even got too much for him.Let me take the opportunity, as I answer this question about the impact of the GST on liquor, which was the question, to correct something I said in answer to the earlier question. This is a very big revelation. I was wrong in the answer that I gave last time. I said the hotel was in Glenelg. I apologise to the member for Adelaide, in whose electorate I understand the hotel I was referring to is in fact located. It is the Criterion Hotel, a very fine hotel. It has very good beers, Mr Speaker. I can assure you it has wonderful beer - not as good as the Bennelong Arms but it has some very good beers. The publicans are Rose and Dick Pain. This is what the article says under the heading `My GST' - that reminds you of something else, doesn't it, Mr Speaker? It says:Criterion Hotel publicans Rose and Dick Pain are no longer worried about the effects of the GST on their city business. The impact on drinkers did not appear to be too great, Mrs Pain said yesterday. 'We got a price list today and the customers have been pleasantly surprised that it's not going up that much,' she said.I wonder who told them that it was going up a lot. It obviously was not a member of the Liberal Party and it obviously was not the ACCC. She goes on to say:'They were all expecting it to be more. We seem to be fairly well prepared for it and I think once it's been in for a week or two, everyone will wonder why they were so worried about it.' Mr Pain said the price change would be the same as any other in the past. He had a computer program ready to handle the new tax. ...The Criterion employs 10 staff and is popular on Friday night with city office workers.I will be in Adelaide in a few weeks time to attend the annual conference of the South Australian division of the Liberal Party, which in percentage terms has performed magnificently in sending members to the federal parliament, and I think I will go along to the Criterion and have one of those very modestly priced Victoria Bitters from this very fine lady who understands the tax system and is clearly in touch with the workers. She knows a scare campaign when she sees it, and this one has come straight out of the mouth of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It is a very important aspect of the new tax system coming into operation on 1 July that for ordinary workers the system will ensure very significant cuts in income tax. This has been the bane of the life of many ordinary workers and many small businesses too. Many people who have been offered the chance of working a bit of overtime in the past where they have had high marginal rates have said, `Really, why should you work overtime when half of what you earn goes to the taxman?' One of the great things of the new tax system is that we are putting incentive back into the system for ordinary workers with the biggest tax cut Australia has ever seen - a $12 billion reduction in income tax. It does mean that, when you are asked to work a bit of overtime, for many Australians, instead of their paying 47c in the dollar, the top rate will be 30c in the dollar, and that is incentive spelt with a capital `i'. For workers it means less tax on the money they earn and less tax on their savings, and so real encouragement to see greater savings and therefore greater investment in the economy. We are also seeing a halving of the capital gains tax as one of the benefits of the government's approach to tax reform. Workers will also receive increased family allowances, giving more disposable income to average families to ensure that they are better off as a result of the introduction of the new system. All that adds up to a very simple difference between the coalition and our Labor opponents. With the coalition, as from 1 July there is a new tax system, and with the new tax system income tax cuts. With the Labor Party, yes, you will still have the GST, but of course we know there will be income tax increases as a result of the roll-over which we are very much looking forward to seeing when the House resumes in August. We look forward to the debate in July at the Labor Party's national conference. I am sure it will be a rigorous one and the 60 per cent of the delegates' votes in the hands of the trade union movement will make sure that they get what they want, as usual. We can have a good debate about it when we come back here.The last thing I want to say, as we meet today for the last time, is that, when the new tax system comes into operation on 1 July, it will be the culmination, I believe, of one of the great acts of political leadership this country has seen. This is one of the most sustained and determined pursuits of a policy in the national interest this country has ever seen. Mr Speaker, you have to go back as far as June 1978 when the then Treasurer - and now Prime Minister - went to the Fraser cabinet and said we needed to change the tax system. It shows you a lot about this debate, because on that occasion not only was he rebuffed by the cabinet but CAI, the Confederation of Australian Industry, was opposed to the change, the Chamber of Manufactures was opposed to the change and leading editorials in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian and elsewhere were opposed to the change. The Australian Retailers Association in 1978 were opposed. But all down through the last 22 years the Prime Minister, knowing what was in the national interest, has been prepared to stick to his guns. In 1979, he was rejected. After the 1980 election he went back to the cabinet again and got another review on that occasion. He was rejected in 1981. In 1984 he had it as part of our policy to go to a broader based consumption tax in the tax system and, of course, we lost in the 1984 election. In 1985 - this one ought to hurt -   -  - Just as a comparison, when the Keating government, when Labor, was in -  - Never forget: Labor was in favour of a consumption tax in 1985 and, instead of taking a cheap shot against what Keating was proposing to do, this is what the Prime Minister then said:I think the public is tired of automatic opposition. It is very easy to talk about a 15 per cent tax on babies' booties but parts of what the government has in mind are very much in line with what we have been advocating.Down through the history of this debate, that is a statement of honesty and political courage which we have never seen from these people. When this tax comes into operation on 1 July, on this side we will say to future generations, `We were part of a great change to the tax system for the benefit of future generations.' -  - Do you know what you will say to your grandkids? You will say to your grandkids, `We knew privately it was a good idea but we opposed it because we thought it was good for us.' In the last 10 years that I have personally been associated with this, as people on this side have been associated with this, we have seen the worst acts of political opportunism in Australia's political history. The Labor Party today stands condemned - and the very people that ought to enjoin with us in condemning you are the very workers who will benefit from this great reform this coming weekend.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I can inform the honourable member for Menzies that to date there have been 2.9 million applications for Australian business numbers and 2.75 million issued. The government estimated in August 1988 that there would be 2.1 million, so that estimate has been exceeded - one of the marks of bringing the black economy into the tax system. Without an Australian business number, a withholding applies, and those people which Labor let operate in the black economy for 13 years are now being brought in. Honest taxpayers are going to get the benefit of that, and I think all Australians will be glad for the honest taxpayers. In relation to the estimates for GST registration, more than 1.9 million Australian businesses are registered for GST, and that compares with the estimate originally made by the government of 1.4 million. Again, that has been exceeded. That has been exceeded notwithstanding every attempt that has been made by the opposition and its allies to frustrate the implementation of the new tax system, including industrial disruption and other action which was supported by the opposition. But the good news is that all of Labor's efforts to sabotage tax reform have failed. In 36 hours, the wholesale sales tax will be abolished. In 36 hours, the biggest income tax cuts in Australian history will come into effect. In 36 hours, family assistance will be increased. In 36 hours, pensions and allowances will be increased. In 36 hours, company tax will be cut. And in 36 hours time, the Labor Party will start supporting a GST. If Mr Beazley were elected Prime Minister today, he would repeal GST, and if he were elected on Saturday he would keep it. When the clock goes past midnight, the Labor Party goes in favour of GST. They have made that entirely clear. For the last two years, they have been so opposed to the GST that, if they ever get elected, guess what - they are going to keep it. They have been waging this campaign to sabotage the introduction of a tax which they want to take advantage of.When people sit back, as my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business said, in 10, 20 and 30 years and say to the Labor Party, `Where were you in the great debates on tax,' do you think the Labor Party is going to say, `We stood foursquare with Swaziland - we wanted a wholesale sales tax; we believed we should have a narrow, indirect high tax on goods'? Is the Labor Party going to turn up and say, `We wanted average earners to be on higher tax rates; we thought they should have been paying 34 cents or 43 cents in the dollar'? Where will the Labor Party be on family assistance? Will they say, `We thought there should have been 12 benefits rather than three' and `We weren't in favour of new Commonwealth-state relations'? No. The Labor Party will rewrite history. They will say, `We were actually in favour of tax reform, just as we were actually in favour of surplus budgets. We might have voted against every measure to get us there, but all along secretly we were for it. All along secretly we were for tax reform. We were only opposed to implementation.' `We weren't the most reactionary political force in the developed world,' they will say. `Oh, no, not us. We were led by Mr Beazley, seconded by Mr Crean. We were very modern in our thinking. We really wanted tax reform.' This has been a fraudulent campaign from the Labor Party from start to finish. When the clock goes to midnight, they are in favour of the GST. Somebody asked the question, `What will be different when we come back in August?' This will be different: when we come back in August, GST will be bipartisanly supported.</DOC>

 - The first point that I want to acknowledge is that all families will receive their full entitlement of child-care benefit. Indeed, there have been some administrative glitches in the sending out of information, but it is important to acknowledge that all families will have their full entitlement of child-care benefit. Those families that may not be receiving that entitlement on 1 July will receive it within the first two weeks and it will be backdated. The important point here is that we are giving additional assistance to families through increasing payments in the child-care benefit, by an additional $600 million. When you look at child care, the greatest detriment to child care in this nation is the Australian Labor Party, because of their mischievous scaring, particularly, of child-care providers. In the last four years of the coalition government, we have spent 37 per cent more on child care than in the last four years of the Labor government. We have spent $4.2 billion, and we will spend $5.6 billion over the next four years, which is significantly more than the Australian Labor Party government spent. We acknowledge that there are some technical issues here. They will be solved. All families will get their full entitlement. With their extra family assistance of $2.4 billion combined with tax cuts, families will be significant beneficiaries in the new tax system on 1 July.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes. The new tax system starting on 1 July will certainly produce a lot of benefits for the small business community. In fact, one of the big reasons for making these changes is to encourage our businesses. We make no bones about that, because if our businesses do well they create more jobs, lift living standards and give us the material things we want in a society such as ours. For those that are incorporated, company tax is coming down; that is a real plus. For those in rural and regional Australia, just slashing the cost of transport is a huge boost to that whole sector, which was so penalised when Labor was in office. Under this government, these reforms are terribly important for the whole rural and regional sector, particularly small business.What a fantastic move the abolition of provisional tax is. One of the great benefits of this package is the abolition of wholesale sales tax. There are thousands of businesses out there which, on 1 July, are going to get a credit for all the wholesale sales tax in their stock. It will be a tremendous boost to their cash flow and it will be a reminder to them of the weight around their neck of Labor's wholesale sales tax for years and years. The slashing of capital gains tax, again putting incentive back into the system, is a real positive for small business. As time moves on, the introduction of the simplified tax system will be another benefit for small business. The pay-as-you-go system has been opposed by the Labor Party out in the community, but they never opposed it in here because they favoured it. It was part of their policy. What incredible opportunism and negativity of the Labor Party to be out scaring small business - yet the delivery mechanism and the new tax administration is something they themselves have supported.The fact is that small business has been in support of this new tax system for a long time. Why? Because it will produce real benefit. There is no doubt there is a lot of work for the small business community to do to be ready and there is no doubt that there is cynicism and the like about any big change. But let me remind you of what somebody once said about this issue. They said:I have every confidence that much of this cynicism on taxation that might have developed through years of political buck passing will give way to a broader appreciation of the need for change and the honest and earnest attempt this government is making to bring about that change.Who said that? When was it said? I will give you a clue: 5 June 1985. It was said by none other than Paul Keating, the then Treasurer and later leader of the Labor Party.As the small business community moves through on Saturday and as the new system settles down, I will tell you what they want to know: they want to know how the Labor Party is going to change the system if Labor is ever elected. They will be watching the news at the end of July because they want to know what crazy scheme the Labor Party is going to cook up to impose on the small business community and to add administrative costs to the small business community. I will tell you what they will also want to know: they will want to know how much it is going to cost, because we all know that the Labor Party's plan is to put up income taxes - and many of the very people who will be paying those taxes will be small business people. When it gets to August and this parliament resumes, we, on behalf of the small business community, will be asking a few basic questions: what are you going to do, what is it going to cost, how are you going to administer it and what impact will it have on small business? Then the debate will really be focused on the GST. It will be about time for the Leader of the Opposition to finally stand up and tell us what he stands for so that there can be a bit of public scrutiny of his secret plans to impose additional red tape on the small business community. </DOC>

 - The new tax legislation clearly sets out which aged care services will be GST free. I would refer the honourable member to sections 38(10), 38(25) and 38(30) of the act. Section 38(10) sets out very specifically that nursing services and 20 other specific health and allied services will be GST free and no determination by me is required for that to be effective. Section 38(25) establishes that, where any individual in a residential setting requires and is receiving the sort of care that is set out in schedule 1 to the Aged Care Act, that will also be GST free. That is because we wish to treat like people in a like manner. Section 38(30) establishes that all HACC and state funded services and payments under HACC are provided GST free. It provides that, where any individual requires personal care, that personal care will be provided GST free. The determinations that I have made - I confirm that I have made them; they will be gazetted tomorrow - will activate the provisions of the legislation, but I may not override the legislation, alter the legislation or extend the legislation. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, I can comment not only on areas where we win but also on some fairly ordinary alternative policies which the Leader of the Opposition might care to explain to the good people of Eden-Monaro when he is down there tonight. As has been pointed out already in this place, transport costs is an area where rural and regional Australia, in particular, will see substantial benefits. At the same time there are a range of other benefits, not least of which are major reductions in income tax for ordinary Australian country families.  Let me come firstly to those transport costs. The cost of diesel for heavy transport will be slashed by 24c-plus a litre. We will see a very significant - and, in the current debate, all too easily overlooked - reduction in the cost of transport equipment. The abolition of Labor's beloved 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on heavy haulage and parts and repairs and what have you will be extremely welcome and will produce real benefits. Of course, the more remote you are - the member who asked the question represents some very remote areas of Australia - the more you will benefit from these massive reductions in the cost of transport, because the present cost is so relatively high. Then there is the total abolition of excise on rail. There is cheaper business fuel, also easily overlooked, because the GST will be rebatable on petrol. There is the $500 million that we are devoting to ensuring that the differential between country and city prices is not exacerbated; it may indeed - as evidenced, incidentally, in the NRMA's work yesterday - be eased as a result of our reforms. Then there are the benefits for families. On the basis of some modelling done by Access, for example, a single income couple with a baby in Collarenebri, in my electorate, on $30,000 a year - a typical new family - will have an extra $65 a week coming into the house from July. A couple in Sale, Victoria, on $40,000 a year and with two children at school - a typical situation where one partner has re-joined the work force - will find an extra $46 a week in their pockets. A self-funded retiree on Queensland's Sunshine Coast with an income of $35,000 a year will find that they receive $13 a week in tax cuts and another $9 a week more in increased social security benefits. It is not hard to find the beneficiaries there. Then we come to some very interesting work done by the Centre for Agricultural and Regional Economics. They did an assessment of five types of farms. They found that a small grazing unit saw an increase in net disposable income of 57 per cent; a medium grazing exercise had a 20 per cent improvement in net disposable income; a cropping partnership, 16.1 per cent; a cropping company, 22 per cent; and a horticultural outfit, a 12 per cent improvement. They are very substantial benefits for rural and regional Australia. I think tonight in Cooma the Leader of the Opposition must explain clearly to those good people why it is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made it quite plain that the Labor Party do not believe the reductions in fuel excise are a good thing at all. They have made it very plain that they believe in the current mix. So in this area they are not going to roll back; they are going to roll out. They are going to take fuel back up to the prices that they currently are at. The Leader of the Opposition might like to explain to those people why it is that the opposition believe that fuel excise should remain on rail. The Leader of the Opposition might like to say why he wants to continue to belt heavy haulage; why it is that he does not want workers in the electorate of Eden-Monaro to have tax relief; why he does not want them left in a situation where 80 per cent of them will pay 30 cents in the dollar or less; and why it is that he does not want that hard-pressed rural sector down there to have between a 57 per cent and a 12 per cent improvement in farmers' net disposable income. That is the reality: those on the opposite side do not want those people in rural and regional Australia to have any of those benefits.I think it is incumbent upon the Leader of the Opposition to explain his position very clearly tonight, because he has only a few hours before time is up for the scare campaign. It will be out of time on Saturday. Yesterday in this place the opposition moved a censure motion which made accusations of deceptions on tax. What utter hypocrisy! They are the greatest deceivers on tax of all time. They will have an opportunity in August when parliament comes back: if they are to enlighten the Australian people as to the widely held perception out there that they are the ultimate deceivers on tax, they will want to put a pretty good position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his sudden interest in the benefits of diesel fuel rebates for rural and regional Australia. It is interesting to note that in 1993, in that infamous budget, those opposite were not so interested when, overnight, excises were increased without any compensation. As well, diesel was jumped up by 3c a litre from 26.573c to 29.573c. There was no forewarning, no compensation; it was just part of Labor's continuing pattern of excise increases from around 6c a litre when they took office to a very high level when they left - some 500 per cent higher. The fact of the matter is that the mechanism to which you are referring today is a rolling six-month average arrangement. That is precisely the one you had in place and it is the one we have continued with. There is no change in it whatsoever. For you now to suddenly make out that the policy is different or differentiates or somehow discriminates against rural people is hypocrisy in the ultimate.</DOC>

 - I am aware of these calls. This morning in the Financial Review it says that the ACTU has called for the abolition of the federal government's Lifetime Health Cover reforms and the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. This would take us back to the bad old days when health premiums went up by anything up to 10 per cent a year - or even by 17 per cent in one year, in 1991. It would mean that private health insurance would again be going through a period of instability - losing profits, high premium increases - and that there would be a great deal of concern, particularly for the 800,000 Australians on incomes under $20,000 a year who have private health insurance.It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition has consistently failed to say that he will actually keep the rebate at 30 per cent. He has consistently refused to say that he will not apply a means test to the rebate. In fact, senior figures in the Labor Party have been privately consulting and sounding out the possibility of rolling the rebate into some sort of superannuation benefit for health care. The Labor Party have not been prepared to rule these things out, and the ACTU have now come out and called for an end to Lifetime Health Cover and an end to the 30 per cent rebate. The fact is that these two reforms have been stunningly successful. By the end of this month, we will have in private health insurance 800,000 Australians who would not have had it without Lifetime Health Cover, and two million extra Australians in private health insurance since we started working in 1997, had the two per cent drop-out a year continued. This gives security to the industry and it gives security to the many older Australians who rely on private health cover. These are long-term reforms. It would be a catastrophe for the situation to go back to what it was under Labor. </DOC>

 - I could add to it. I could say that, if that family decides to buy a car on hire-purchase, the hire-purchase payments might offset the taxation reduction. What a ridiculous question. I thank the member for Jagajaga because it gives me an unexpected opportunity to extol the success of the government's policy to provide incentives for Australians to take out private health insurance. I think what the question reveals - and this a very important point that will not be lost on middle Australia - is that here is the mind-set of the would-be health minister in a Labor government. She sees incentives encouraging people to take out private health insurance as being some kind of compulsion. Deep down the member for Jagajaga hates private health insurance. Deep down the Labor Party hates private health insurance. Of course, she hates it so much she has probably got it - it is a bit like the GST. The best evidence of this is that when the Labor Party were in office they deliberately, and in a quite calculated way, allowed private health insurance in this country to bleed to death. They set out ideologically to destroy private health insurance. They do not believe in Australians having the option of a private provision for health. They believe in a public monopoly for health.We on this side of the House believe in a balanced health system. We believe in a strong public sector; we also believe in a strong private sector. It will be one of the great achievements of this government, for which I thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care. He has done an absolutely outstanding job in his portfolio. What the minister has done in his portfolio is a great credit to him, through the combination of the private health insurance rebate and also the Lifetime Health Cover.Incidentally, in the end, did the Labor Party support Lifetime Health Cover? They did! They supported Lifetime Health Cover. Dear, oh dear, oh me! That is the reverse of the GST. They supported Lifetime Health Cover but now they are against it. With the GST, they are opposing it; but on Sunday morning, they will be in favour of it. It is the reverse. Can I say to the member for Jagajaga that your analogy is absurd. There is no compulsion. We are providing an effective incentive. As a result of this policy, hundreds of thousands of Australians are now joining private health insurance. It will take some of the load off the public sector, and I think that is a triumph of enlightened, balanced health policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite because I know that he represents vigorously his constituents' interest in getting into export markets. Indeed, he has always been a very true man on trade issues ever since I first knew him, which is quite some years ago.  -  - We will come to you lot in a minute. It is worth the House remembering that one in five - that is around 1.8 million - Australian jobs depend on exports. These jobs pay 20 per cent more than the average for jobs in Australia. One of the objectives of this government is to build our exports and to build employment in export industries. Of course, that is one of the reasons why not only this country is introducing a GST but also something like 150 countries around the world have the GST indirect tax system - because it makes your exports more competitive.On Saturday morning, $3½ billion worth of taxes will be taken off Australian exports. Frankly, I think all exporters in Australia need to remember that the Labor Party was in favour of $3½ billion worth of additional tax on our exports, as compared with the coalition. That is a very simple proposition, and it explains why 150 countries around the world have introduced a VAT or a GST indirect tax system. As the Treasurer so often points out, when it comes to alternative policies, the Labor Party in this country is just about the only major political party in any liberal democracy that opposes a VAT or GST indirect tax system. It does not matter whether you go to Europe, to Africa, to our neighbours in East Asia or to South America, these countries all have a VAT indirect tax system. Let me point out that even the United States has a sales tax on services. The simple proposition is that they do not have the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax system. The simple proposition is that, from Saturday morning, our exporters will pay $3½ billion less in tax than was the case under the Labor Party tax system. Do not worry, Mr Speaker, that is something we will remind them of right up until the next election.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, if my calculations are correct I think that, in the normal arrangements, this is the last question from the opposition. I note with interest that the opposition, having complained for a week about the Treasurer being away, have not asked him one question today about taxation. You absolute phonies! - You have not asked him one question. You traduce the man's commitment to his job and you do not have the courage to ask him one question. You are a hopeless lot. Let me move to the question. - Everybody knows that, as a result of the changes imposed by the tax plan we took to the Australian people in 1998, the abolition of FID and BAD was resolved. I thought even the Leader of the Opposition knew that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. After two decades farmers will finally have a modern tax system on Saturday. Farmers have been campaigning for at least 20 years for a modern tax system so that they can compete effectively with other farmers around the world. And so, in less than 33 hours time, one of the burdens they have had to carry in international competition will be removed. No longer will they have to pay embedded taxes in the costs of their production. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said a few moments ago, $3½ billion will be taken off their costs. Exporters will have the same kind of taxation system as people in other parts of the world with, of course, the exception of Swaziland. In 33 hours time the long-standing partnership between Labor and Swaziland will also come to an end because that is the time when Labor will change their tax policy. Labor did not have the courage in government to make these sorts of fundamental changes. They were always quick to criticise but they never had the courage to do the job. I thought the House would be interested in a couple of comments from today's editorial in the Fraser Coast Chronicle. I think they are well worth reading, Mr Prime Minister, because they make some comments about your achievements in this regard. It said:Prime Minister John Howard has had the guts to tackle the reform of our tax system while his predecessors bleated about the sprawling mass of taxation red tape that was suffocating the nation and stifling incentive. For once, we have a Prime Minister prepared to put the interests of the nation before his own welfare. The article also says:Australia is one of the few industrialised countries persisting with an outmoded, inequitable sales tax system instead of a broad-based consumer tax. That will change on Saturday, but our nation has allowed itself to be whipped into a frenzy of apprehension by shallow media reporting and mischievous Labor propaganda.I think that some of our capital city dailies would be well advised to take some advice from the editor of the Fraser Coast Chronicle - not a newspaper noted for praising the government, but it is absolutely right on this occasion. The government has had the courage to do what Labor would never have got around to do.The Fraser Coast Chronicle knows that, for farmers, this new tax system will save them around $7,000 a year. They will have lower income taxes because of the tax cuts. They will have lower costs as a result of the wholesale sales tax being taken out of their operations. There will be lower fuel costs, lower costs on transport and lower costs on rail. Those sorts of things are a major breakthrough for the rural sector. On Saturday, we will have a new taxation system, and the next time this House assembles, we will have an opposition with a different tax policy. They will no longer be against GST. They will no longer be on the same side as Swaziland, supporting the wholesale sales tax system. I am looking forward to some questions from the other side that praise GST. I am looking forward to members getting up during estimates and other debates, telling us what a wonderful new tax system we have in this country and reminding us that it was the tax system that they supported about 15 or so years ago - but did not have the courage to implement.Labor have a federal conference coming up, and they will come back, no doubt, with renewed vigour - a renewed tax system; a totally changed arrangement. In August Labor will tell us what they are going to do in relation to the taxation system of Australia, but we know one thing for sure - they will be backing a GST, because they know that it has always been good for Australia. They never had the courage to do it, but Australian people will benefit in just under 33 hours time from a modern taxation system which we will share with the rest of the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. It is true that the judgment of the Federal Court delivered by Justice O'Loughlin last Friday was a very important judgment and it is one that repays very careful study. I do not dispute that contained in that judgment was the excerpt read by the Leader of the Opposition. I accept on this occasion that he has quoted it accurately. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the principal basis on which I have argued a formal national apology in the terms constantly sought by the Leader of the Opposition is not appropriate is that it is not appropriate in my view and it is a view shared throughout the government that current generations should apologise for the deeds of earlier generations over which they had no control and which were in fact sanctioned by the law prevailing at the time.It is important as we try to analyse in a sensitive fashion the judgment made by the court. I followed the case carefully. Although it was clearly the verdict of the court that in the case of Mr Gunner he was removed with the consent of his mother and in the case of Mrs Cubillo there was no evidence that she had been removed in circumstances that breached the statutory duty of the relevant government official, I think there is a clear acceptance by everybody that they are practices that current generations would never embrace and current generations would be critical of. It remains the view of the government that the most appropriate thing now to do is to focus on the future and to focus on bringing those members of the indigenous community of Australia who were subject to these practices back in contact with their families. That is why the government has strongly supported the $63 million program, recommended by the Wilson committee, that is designed to provide a link between the affected people and their families and is designed to do a number of other things. While we are on the subject of what was contained in the court judgment, I might remind the Leader of the Opposition - I think it is relevant to the debate that has gone on - of an excerpt from His Honour's judgment that has not been covered in any of the media reports thus far. Amongst the other things that His Honour found was this statement:The court found that the applicants failed to produce evidence that would substantiate a finding that there was a sweeping general policy of removal and detention. He goes on to say:There was no widespread practice of forcibly removing part Aboriginal children from their mothers. The court was satisfied that the number of part Aboriginal children living in the Territory far exceeded the capacity of the institutions to receive them and the patrol officers to remove them.It remains the case that the government is sensitive to the ongoing trauma felt. That ongoing trauma was specifically acknowledged in the resolution of regret which passed through this parliament last year. It is my view and the government's view that that resolution of regret, fully supported by the Labor Party, was an appropriate expression of the current generation and the current parliament's views about those past practices. It is overwhelmingly the government's view that we should help these people get on with their lives in the future. The most effective way of doing that is to implement the recommendations that are embraced in that $63 million program. </DOC>

 - Well may the member for Hughes ask me that question, because I have very good news for not only the people of Hughes but also middle Australia all around the country. As a result of the policies of this government, I can inform the House that, on 30 June in the year 2000, the number of Australians covered by private health insurance had risen to 41.2 per cent of the entire population. If you take veterans out of the base, which it is appropriate to do, that figure is 41.8 per cent. This represents a thumping endorsement of the policies of the federal government. It represents an emphatic embrace by middle Australia of the tax rebate offered by the government at the last election. It vindicates the policies of the health minister. I am not surprised - I was with a group of people over the weekend and a number of them said to me, `Michael Wooldridge is the best health minister Australia has had for 20 years.' Let me say that I very warmly endorse that. He is an outstanding health minister. On this particular issue, my friend and colleague the health minister has a colleague -  - He has a colleague you know a lot about - Graham Richardson. Graham Richardson had a lot to say about private health insurance. He was the one who said that once the number of people covered by private health insurance fell below 40 per cent you had a problem and the system would start to bleed to death. That is exactly what the Labor Party deliberately set out to do. When the member for Fremantle was the health minister in the former government, she wanted to destroy private health insurance. The good news that I have announced today - and it does not end with what I have announced today - and the advice we have indicates that, as a result of the extension of the deadline for Lifetime Health Cover for another two weeks, it is expected that the number of people covered by private health insurance will grow significantly above 41.2 per cent in the current quarter.This is a spectacularly successful policy. This represents the re-enfranchising of middle Australia so far as private health insurance is concerned. Private health insurance has always been something that middle Australia has wanted. Middle Australia resented the whittling away of the incentives and middle Australia is apprehensive about the threat to their new-found capacity to be in private health insurance. There is one threat, and that threat is the election of a possible Labor government here in Canberra.; I really   - They wouldn't do it? They would indeed! - They would indeed. I exhort the Treasurer not to imagine for a moment that the Labor Party would not attempt to get rid of private health insurance or, at the very least, to introduce a savage means test. When the member for Jagajaga was asked on two occasions on the weekend before last whether she would rule out a means test, she refused to do so. At the very best, the Leader of the Opposition is a very, very reluctant supporter of the policies that have put over 41 per cent of Australians in private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition has effectively said, `I think it is a bad policy, but my polling tells me I ought to keep it.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done. But of course you always have to rely on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you always have to rely on somebody else, to drag a bit of political truth into this issue. Just as Della Bosca brought home a few truths in relation to roll-back, just as Della brought you back to reality, today in the Financial Review Simon Crean, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has brought the Labor Party back to reality in relation to its promises.You now have the intriguing situation where the Leader of the Opposition says, `I'm going to roll back the GST but I won't tell you how much and where, but I'm going to guarantee to the states that if I roll it back they won't be worse off; therefore I have got to find the money from somewhere else; I'm going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars extra on health and education,' and then along comes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and do you know what he says? Unbelievably he says, `I'm going to have bigger surpluses than the coalition.' Yes, that would have made `Mr $10 ½ billion deficit' blush with embarrassment. In the words of that famous AFL commercial, with regard to the Labor Party having bigger surpluses than the coalition, `I'd like to see that.' I would like to see that would.The reality is that, as every economically literate person in this country knows, if you are going to have roll-back, protect the states, spend hundreds of millions of dollars extra on health and education and have bigger surpluses than we have now, there is only one way to do it and that is to increase income tax. That has always been the secret agenda of the Leader of the Opposition. I warmly thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for doing another Della Bosca and reminding us of a few of the economic and political realities of the Australian Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - It has taken somebody from this side to ask a question about tax reform. You can always rely on the coalition to be interested in tax reform and you can always rely on the members of the Labor Party to oppose it. This is of course the first day back after the world was meant to come to an end. In the last week we were here we were told that the equivalent of political Armageddon was about to arrive. We were told that the world was going to come to an end on 1 July, and they faced on 1 July an `absolute nightmare'. The Leader of the Opposition said:What the take-up now means in relation to business numbers is a disaster on 1 July. Let us not put too fine a point on all of this.Well, he certainly did not when he said it was going to be a `disaster'As an example of economic management you could not imagine a more disastrous policy both in its strategy and execution. The horror picture is it is a complete mess. This is hell, this is hell in a small place, and I think there will be an awful lot of people experiencing terrible troubles with that as the year unfolds. - Gee, if it was as bad as that, why didn't you mention it in your speech to the national convention? The reality of this is that the Leader of the Opposition was down on bended knees for months before 1 July, hoping and praying that the Australian people would be unhappy when the new tax system was introduced. He was not interested in something that was good for the country. He was not interested in trying to constructively change things for the better. He was merely hoping to `surf into victory'. That was the expression he used at that December caucus meeting, when he stood up and said, `Don't worry, colleagues, we're going to surf into victory on the back of public hostility to tax reform.' I know that for the six months leading up to 1 July they had the wind behind them; they could exploit a fear campaign in relation to every minute element of the introduction of the goods and services tax. All the while the government was trying to do the right thing by the Australian people: the government was trying to introduce a tax system that would give this country the largest personal income tax cuts in history.I am very proud to report that so far the new taxation system has been introduced far more smoothly than the Labor Party predicted - and, I have to say, even more smoothly than on occasions I thought might be the case. That, may I say, is a great credit to the business community of Australia. I want to particularly thank small businesses for the tremendous amount of work that they have done. I also thank the Treasurer for the absolutely first-class job he has done as the minister largely responsible for the detailed introduction of the new tax system. I want to thank the Australian Taxation Office. It is easy to condemn the tax commissioner, as the Labor Party has done, under the privilege of parliament and quite disgracefully - absolutely shamefully. I think all of those have done an extremely good job. So far the economic indicators back up the proposition that the introduction of the new system has gone very smoothly. The Westpac Melbourne Institute indicates consumer sentiment rose by more than 10 per cent in July. Also the Westpac Melbourne Institute's survey of inflation recorded a big fall in July from 7.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent. The economic consultancy firm Econotech has also been surveying the impact on consumer prices. Its latest survey conducted on 1 August provides an estimate of the CPI effect from the changeover of 3.2 per cent, whereas the Commonwealth budget forecast was 3¾ per cent.The best figures of all and the ones that must have choked the Leader of the Opposition most were those magnificent employment figures last Thursday. They are the best employment figures that this country has seen for a decade. They show a dramatic fall in youth unemployment. They show a dramatic rise to almost 810,000 in the number of jobs created by this government since March 1996. And be it remembered that they are a product of the economic conditions that we have created with our policies - policies that the Labor Party opposed every inch of the way. One of the great criticisms of the many that can be made of the Leader of the Opposition is that not only did they leave us with a $10½ billion deficit but they had the nerve, having left us with that $10½ billion deficit, to try to stop us cleaning it up. That will remain forever to their great discredit. </DOC>

 - I am aware of the findings or the statements in the judgment of Mr Justice O'Loughlin just referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. I dispute the Leader of the Opposition's claim that the trauma to which he refers has never been acknowledged by the government; it has on numerous occasions. There was a very clear and explicit acknowledgment of that in the resolution that was passed last year. There was a very clear acknowledgment of that in the acceptance of the recommendations of the recent report in relation to linking people affected by these practices up with their families.The Leader of the Opposition raises the question of some kind of alternative method of legally handling these cases. I notice in the wake of the Federal Court decision that has been taken up not only by the opposition but also by the Australian Democrats and by a number of others in the Australian community. One of them, Senator Ridgeway, speaking on behalf of the Australian Democrats, has argued for some kind of reparations tribunal. For a number of reasons, including the statements made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and minister assisting me on reconciliation matters in a Sunday interview yesterday, there is a strange notion abroad that if you have a reparations or compensation tribunal, you eliminate the lawyers, you eliminate any argument and you save all of the money. The unfortunate thing - and I say this very directly and with great good will to the member for Barton - is that that is just not the experience of other tribunals in this country. Nobody knows that better than the minister for immigration. The minister for immigration quoted a figure of about 900 cases that had been decided by immigration tribunals that had been appealed.The reality is that the rule of law under which we live and to which the Leader of the Opposition referred very positively in an earlier question allows people to appeal the decisions of tribunals, and there is no guarantee at all that you would save money by going down that path. I think it is very interesting to recall some words that were uttered by Senator Ridgeway. He has been critical of the government on this issue and I note that, but that is his right in the vigorous debate that naturally goes on. On 24 August last year, when being interviewed on Radio National's breakfast program, he had this to say:I think the question of reparation for suffering is something that needs to be dealt with by the courts. It's always been clear that even if that were acknowledged by a resolution in the parliament that that is something that would always have to be dealt with by the courts... It's an issue of saying that the compensation matter is something that should be set aside and dealt with in the courts where it's currently being dealt with and tested in the Northern Territory... I think that we should leave that to the courts to decide. There are certainly things that we could acknowledge in terms of historical fact, but I don't think that we should be so clear and that we should leave that to the courts, in the end, to make a decision on it. The point I simply make is not to dispute for a moment the trauma to which these people were subjected or the ongoing trauma they suffer. That has been acknowledged. Whilst I accept there are differences of approach between the government and the opposition on this issue, I do not accept for a moment that this government, this side of politics and those who disagree in relation to a formal apology are insensitive to the suffering of people in the past. It was because of that suffering that the resolution of regret was in fact brought down by me and supported, I gratefully acknowledge, by the Australian Democrats through Senator Ridgeway and also by the opposition.The debate is really about whether you have a formal apology. I have stated the government's reasons in relation to that and they remain on foot. In relation to the legal liability, the decision last Friday was very significant. The applicants have certain legal rights in relation to appeal. That is something for them to decide, but I want to make it very plain on behalf of the government that we do not support the idea of a reparations tribunal. One of the reasons we do not support it is we do not believe it would be cheaper than going through the court system. There is more than a suggestion in the reaction of many people that, having been disappointed by the decision of the Federal Court on Friday, they now seek a mechanism that would produce a different result. Rather than trying to seek a mechanism that might provide a focus on the future, they would prefer to seek a mechanism that might produce a different result. It does not follow. Basically, what the shadow Attorney-General said on Sunday was that you should reverse the onus of proof. That is what he said. I watched his interview and he is nodding: he wants to reverse the onus of proof. What the Labor Party is saying is, `The normal system didn't deliver the outcome we wanted so we want a new system.' What I say to the Leader of the Opposition and what I say to the shadow Attorney-General is: why don't you be honest enough and say that, instead of hiding behind this argument that in some way a reparations tribunal would be cheaper? A reparations tribunal would not be cheaper. The experience of the immigration tribunal demonstrates that. Also, I think it is very important when people are analysing the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin that they analyse all parts of it and they acknowledge those parts which cast doubt on many of the sweeping assertions made about the stolen generation as well as quite properly drawing attention to sections of the judgment that dwelt upon the pain and suffering of people affected by these practices. We share to the full with the opposition a concern about those practices. We acknowledge that there is ongoing trauma. We have combined with the opposition in passing a resolution acknowledging that, and it remains one of the great distortions of this debate for the Leader of the Opposition -  - and for those who sit behind him, most particularly the voluble, but not very precise on occasions when it comes to his own policy, member for Banks, whose immortal contribution to this debate can best be encapsulated by the two words: Laurie, Laurie.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I think like all Australians he would have been pleased to see that the unemployment figures which came out for the month of July showed that unemployment is now at 6.3 per cent, the lowest in a decade since April 1990. I think all Australians will be glad to see that almost 810,000 new jobs have been created in Australia since the coalition came to office, and nearly a quarter of those - 248,000 - were created last year.Far from all the doom and gloom predictions of the opposition about how tax reform would put people out of work, for the month of July - the first month of the new taxation system - 76,000 Australians got jobs who did not have them before. Isn't that wonderful news for the people of Australia?  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. We need hardly remind him that he was once an employment minister. He was employment minister when unemployment peaked at 11.3 per cent, and his biggest boast as employment minister was in a speech in September 1994 - and well may he turn his back, as he always does when he is reminded of his own record - when he said: `Unemployment has fallen. It is down to 10.3 per cent. We expect it to continue falling.' Mr Speaker, I had forgotten this until I went through the records, but do you know who took over from him as employment minister? It was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Simply Simon.The Financial Review is going into comedy these days with some of its reporting: `Labor promises bigger budget surpluses' - oh really, oh dear. When the Leader of the Opposition was the finance minister, in his last full year as finance minister his surplus was negative $10,300 million. The Sydney Morning Herald was trying to excuse him in its editorial on Saturday by saying that the economy was contracting. No, I am afraid that you produced those deficits when the economy was growing. The economy grew by 4.5 per cent in 1995-96, and the then finance minister produced a budget surplus of negative $10,300 million. The year before that when the economy grew at 4½ per cent, he produced a budget deficit of $13 billion - that is, $23 billion in two years. Until this government came to office there were not surpluses. We had to take a $10 billion deficit; we had to drag the budget into surplus. We were fought every step of the way. The Labor Party opposed every savings measure. They did what they could to defeat us in the Senate, and when they were defeated what was their argument: we are actually in favour of bigger surpluses.It is like the GST. For three years they fought us on tax reform. For three years the GST was the one thing that could never be made fair. And now what do we find? They are so opposed to it that, if they are ever re-elected, they are going to keep it. Or have I missed something? Is there still a political party in here that is in favour of wholesale sales tax? Excuse me, is there still a political party in here in favour of wholesale sales tax? You can abolish goods and services tax and go back to wholesale sales tax - Swaziland has one. You can go back to where we were on 30 June. I said before 30 June that when parliament comes back the GST will have bipartisan support. They do not disagree. Nobody is quite sure what the interjection is at this point. Is the interjection, `We are still against GST?' Or is the interjection that you are now in favour of it?For three years they wasted the time of this parliament opposing a GST which they now want to keep. They could not mention the word `roll-back' at their conference because, after John Della Bosca, it is a completely discredited policy. I reckon that if Jack Egerton can get a knighthood, so should John Della Bosca. `Sir John Della Bosca' who made the most obvious principle: you cannot roll the GST back and keep it simple. There was a wonderful cartoon in the Sydney Morning Herald where the Leader of the Opposition was trying to work out his tax policy, with a sign behind him which said, `Keep it stupid, simple'. Labor on roll-back: keep it stupid, simple. They fought us every step of the way. It was completely opportunistic; it was completely fraudulent. We come back to this parliament, and we realise that they are now in favour of GST. They fought us on surpluses, and they are now in favour of bigger surpluses. This is an opposition without any economic credibility at all.</DOC>

 - Once again the Leader of the Opposition has deliberately misrepresented a policy. The response that I have had from pensioners and self-funded retirees has not been in the terms as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition. In fact I have received, as have a large number of my colleagues, a significant number of calls and letters from pensioners and self-funded retirees saying that they had no idea that there was any savings bonus at all. They were immensely grateful that the government has introduced it. I say to pensioners and self-funded retirees of Australia that we have, as we always do, delivered in full on the commitments that we have made to that section of the Australian population.In the process of telling them that, I remind them that, when the Australian Labor Party was last in government, it went to an election attacking a GST; it did not say anything about changing the wholesale sales tax system. When it had been deceitfully re-elected, without warning, without mandate, without justification and without compensation it then increased the wholesale sales tax at every point of the rate scale range to the great detriment of the pensioners and self-funded retirees of this country. When I look back at what private health insurance has done for self-funded retirees, I think of the extension of the health benefit card, the savings bonuses and the many other changes that have been made that have been of enormous benefit to self-funded retirees. It is no wonder that a great volume of the messages that I have received since 1 July are messages of satisfaction and gratitude from the retired people of Australia. They know they now have a government that will guarantee their economic security and not a government that will run their country into massive debt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question because he would know, as I would, that roll-back of GST would have a dramatic effect on the Commonwealth budget position. Let's suppose that the Labor Party only roll it back 50 per cent. That is $12 billion, which would mean the abolition of every income tax cut which was awarded on 1 July. Let's suppose that they only want to roll it back by one-third. That is $8 billion - the equivalent of a 24c or 25c hike in petrol excise. I was asked about alternative policies. We know this: the alternative policy is to roll back the GST, to make up the revenue lost to the states through other taxation, to roll back tax on fuel, to return bracket creep, to pay business to collect GST, to oppose the excise on beer, to substantially increase spending on education, to substantially increase spending on training, to substantially increase spending on research, to review HECS, to have a dental scheme, to have a decade of growth in Commonwealth-state health funding, to have regional infrastructures and also, as we heard this morning, to have larger surpluses. Labor pledge bigger budget surpluses. So they are going to spend more on everything, tax everything less and produce bigger budget surpluses. As an interview in the Australian Financial Review noted, the great task of Beazley and Crean is to try to prove that they would not be like the Whitlam government. `The experience of the last Labor government in which a Crean served as Treasurer was not particularly encouraging', says the Financial Review. These are just mere words to them: `Oh, we'll have surpluses. We'll roll back taxation, increase spending and have surpluses.' It does not work like that. They had six years from 1990 with decent growth in the Australian economy to produce a surplus. They produced $13 billion deficits and $10 billion deficits. It was also said in this interview - this is the part I like the best - and this is speaking of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `He is also grappling with contradictory elements of Labor policy such as those relating to the sale of Telstra and GST.' It says this: `He goes off the record quite often to express a personal view.' I bet he goes off the record when it comes to Telstra because we still remember Frank Blount saying that there had been a Labor minister in a former Labor government who had expressed some off-the-record comments on Telstra. I bet he goes off the record when he talks about the GST.  If the opposition are going to prove that roll-back is any more than throw back, then they have to say what they are going to roll back on, when they are going to do it, how much it is going to cost and how they are going to fund it. After two years of opposing the government on tax reform saying that they are absolutely opposed to the GST, we now find that they are going to keep the GST and roll it back. But they cannot tell you on what, when or how much it is going to cost or how they are going to pay for it. These are just linguistic games played by people who do not understand economic policy. If it were any more than that after two years, they would be able to name something, how much, what proportion, and where they are going. The opposition have been engaged in an elaborate fraud on the parliament for two years now. For two years the opposition have been running around saying that they were opposed to the GST, which they always intended to keep, and the next subterfuge is to say that they are going to roll it back when they cannot name one single area. I read in the paper that the New South Wales Labor Party Right is upset that it is excluded from all economic portfolios, and well they might be. I know there is not much talent there, but they do not have much to compete against. If the advice that is coming from Della Bosca and others is to get on board with the government's tax reform, to start supporting it, it would be advice well taken rather than engaging in this contradictory subterfuge.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. We saw some great results this afternoon from the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, PHIAC - the best results we have ever seen in a quarter - that now nearly eight million people have private health insurance. As the Prime Minister said, we will not know for another quarter what the final results will be because of policies that came into effect on 1 July and the extra people who, in the two weeks grace period, took out Lifetime Health Cover. But we would expect the figure to go up another couple of per cent and then stabilise, maybe drop a little bit, but it will be well above 40 per cent, taking it back to what it was in the early 1990s.This is great news for public hospitals. Public hospital funding is complex and our strategy has been twofold. The first is to provide direct extra resources to the states and territories and the second is to stop the bleeding that the public hospitals are going through because of the drop out in private health insurance. On the first score, since 1997-98 Commonwealth funding in real terms to states and territories for public hospitals has gone up by 23 per cent. The states' own funding for their hospitals over the same period of time has gone up in real terms 10 per cent. So, if there is any pressure on state public hospitals, it is because the states and territories have refused to put in the same effort that the Commonwealth has; or have, in some cases, actually taken money out in recent times, such as New South Wales which has decided that the Olympics is more important. As well as direct funding, though, one has to address the cause of the problem, that is, the extra demand put on the public hospital system by the drop out from private health insurance and the loss of revenue occurring to the public hospital system because they do not have that income stream anymore. This is well known to anyone who has to run hospitals and is the reason Bob Carr and Peter Beattie have in the past been on the record as saying that the public hospital system would work much better if private health insurance was fixed. It has been put that this large increase will make no difference because of the existence of up front and deductible products. I do not believe that for a moment. My own department's estimates, on the basis of very conservative assumptions about utilisation rates, are that over the next two to three years this increase in people's private health insurance will mean an extra 400,000 treatments per annum will occur for people who are privately insured, a majority of them in the private system, thus taking some of the pressure of demand off the public hospital system. Up to 400,000 treatments per annum is an enormous amount of medical care, care that can now be delivered in the public or private system and, when it is not delivered in the public system, that frees up beds for other areas. Further, we believe that people using the private health system will provide a revenue stream to the state public hospitals, and we have agreed with the states that we will examine this very closely.The honourable member also asked what would be the effect of roll-back. Roll-back would be a disaster. It has taken 4½ years of really hard work to turn round the private health insurance sector and give it some stability. It now has a period of stability when we can expect premium increases to be kept to a minimum, we can expect health funds to address the gap and we can expect some pressure to be taken off the state public hospitals. The Labor Party has pointedly refused to rule out fiddling with the 30 per cent rebate. Rolling back the 30 per cent rebate would be a catastrophe. It would lead to instability in the industry, it would lead to greatly increased complexity, it would lead to premium increases, it would lead to more pressure on state public hospitals and it would lead to a dropping off of revenue to state public hospitals. There are eight million Australians who do not want this to happen. The Labor Party knows that this is something that middle Australia wants. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the ticker to stand up to the left wing of the Labor Party. We are very happy to take him on on this issue any time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. There is no doubt that these tremendous benefits have arisen from the fact that the government has been pursuing a reform agenda. We have been fixing up the problems that we inherited from the previous Labor government, and we have been fixing them up with the strident opposition of the Leader of the Opposition, who described himself proudly during the break as a `carping' opposition leader. `Carping' is defined by the dictionary as: `grousing', `nitpicking' - a grousing, nitpicking opposition leader, bereft of any ideas of his own.But even though the Leader of the Opposition has stood against us - used the opposition's union numbers in the Senate at every opportunity - these last figures are very good: 809,000 jobs since March 1996. You can compare that to when Labor was in. In their last six years - we have done this in under five years - there were just under 400,000 jobs created. Of those, only 27,100 were full time. Compare that to the number of full-time jobs under us, which is 452,000 jobs - a tremendous result and, as I say, a consequence of just doing the hard yards and fixing the problems that had to be fixed.One of the reasons that Australia's employment performance has been much better is because the government supports small business. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand: if you support small business, they will go out and create the jobs. And that is exactly what they have been doing. That is why the government has in the Senate a bill to help small business by encouraging them to employ more people, and that is why it is very disappointing that the Labor Party is opposed to more reforms - in this case a reform that could help to create up to 50,000 jobs. It is a pity that they are not prepared to support the small business community. The Leader of the Opposition will not support that reform. You would have to ask, `Why won't he?' In fact, he told us. He told us on Perth radio 6PR on 7 July, when he said:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.That is one thing we do believe. We do not believe the member for Hunter, who was in the paper this morning as saying:Labor is chasing the small business vote. We will go further than the government will go in a number of key areas.What a fraud! What a joke! The fact is the Labor Party is not interested in small business - straight out of the words of the Leader of the Opposition. And if you are not prepared to support small business, then you are not interested in creating jobs. The Labor Party's policy on small business is a fraud, just as their policy in respect of small business on tax is a fraud. John Della Bosca said it. What he said was absolutely true. Your roll-back, in all its complexity, simply is a mess for small business. That is why roll-back is a disaster. There is only one side of politics that supports small business - it is this side - and it certainly is working, with record numbers of people now in jobs. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. Before last week the Leader of the Opposition promised a policy feast in education; `meat on the bones' is what we were going to get. I have to say, now that the week is concluded, that it was very thin pickings. It was hard to find the bones, let alone the meat. We got a policy famine down there in Hobart. The Leader of the Opposition's speeches were breathtaking in their emptiness. There were lots of motherhood statements. There was the typical class warfare rhetoric that was needed for Shazza and Dezza. There were a few more scholarships. A web site was hastily downloaded from Tony Blair, name and all, nothing changed, just Tony Blair's web site brought down. The policy vacuum was alive and well.But it was not so much what was in the policy speeches, so-called, of the Leader of the Opposition but what was not in those speeches that was significant. There was no commitment in Hobart by the Labor Party to the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks. There was not a word from the Leader of the Opposition, while the teachers unions in South Australia and Western Australia were boycotting the literacy tests, that he disapproved of this action. There was not a word. That is the real test of credibility on literacy and numeracy. There was not a mention in his speech of the 70 per cent of young people who do not go straight from school to university. That was a blind spot when Labor was in office. It is still a blind spot for the Leader of the Opposition. These young people who need a bit of assistance were totally neglected by the Leader of the Opposition.There was not a word from the Leader of the Opposition disassociating himself from the pattern bargaining of the National Tertiary Education Union which is undermining the capacity of the universities to get the flexibility they need. Why were these gaps there? Because these are the policy sacrifices demanded by the education unions of the Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition is all too willing to give in to them. He is too weak to stand up for the standards that Australian parents are looking for, for opportunities for disadvantaged young people.It was no surprise that at the end of the conference the Leader of the Opposition announced a committee to work out what the knowledge nation was going to be all about. This committee has got a very interesting membership. It includes the member for Bonython as the deputy chair. It includes the member for Perth, the member for Griffith and the member for Rankin. There is just one strange omission from this committee -  - The member for Werriwa was not on it, and he is the only one with any ideas. You would think they might have drawn on him. But the member for Dobell was not on the committee to develop the policies for the knowledge nation. Education has got nothing to do with the knowledge nation, apparently. Certainly the member for Dobell has nothing to contribute. That is now official from the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Dobell has nothing to contribute, because he had made his contribution to the policy vacuum evident in the Leader of the Opposition's speeches. He delivered all that he had to deliver. There was nothing else to deliver. He is the spokesman for the policy vacuum, and that is now official. The Leader of the Opposition spoke the truth when he said to his biographer, `I thought there was less capacity to achieve in the education portfolio than in just about any I have had.' That was the truth - less capacity for him to achieve than in any other portfolio - and the Hobart conference confirmed fully the truth of those words. </DOC>

 - We know what the member for Grayndler does in his spare time when he is masquerading as a caravan park tenant, whether it is at Tweed Heads or in other areas. The government did make an announcement - and it was a good announcement - of increased rental assistance, raising it from a maximum rate of seven per cent to 10 per cent, an additional $33 million. From the increase from the new tax system, $100 million of new money has gone in rental assistance. That is assisting over one million Australians. A large proportion of those are in boarding houses as well, in your electorate, Member for Grayndler, and others. For those who are in mobile home parks, the vast majority of those seeking rental assistance are getting 75 per cent of it. They had their four per cent pension increase. The response that has been coming from constituents in my area, no doubt along with the constituents in other coalition seats, is that the new tax system has been warmly received.</DOC>

 - These programs are at risk if members opposite are ever lucky enough to get back into government. I am aware of reports emanating from the Labor Party's recent national conference in Hobart, where the shadow minister for employment, the member for Dickson, said that the Labor Party supports Work for the Dole but wants to change its name and change the way it works. This is as absolutely oxymoronic as saying that I belong to the Labor Party but I want to change all its policies and I want to change its name as well. It is a complete contradiction in terms. People should be under no doubt whatsoever that Labor wants to abolish Work for the Dole because this program has been too successful at getting people off welfare and into work.I have also been asked about the Job Network. The essence of the Job Network is that job seekers have a choice of employment agencies which are providing services on a pay-by-results basis. That is the essence of the Job Network. It is competition and choice which is responsible for the fact that the Job Network is 50 per cent better at getting job seekers into work than the system it has replaced. At the Labor Party national conference, the member for Dickson said with great fanfare, `Labor is not abolishing the Job Network'. But the member for Lilley stood up five minutes later and said that Labor will remove compulsory competitive tendering based on price and competition. On the one hand they support the Job Network and on the other hand they will destroy the foundation on which the Job Network is based. Who is right? Is it the member for Dickson? Is it the member for Lilley? There is no point in Job Network members who now fear for their future looking to the Leader of the Opposition for guidance. Back in June he said, `We won't be looking to knock off the competitive market'. I presume his deafening silence ever since shows that he has been rolled on employment policy by the member for Lilley just as he has been rolled on family policy by the member for Jagajaga. </DOC>

 - I was hoping I would get that question. This is the Labor Party's policy! The policy for the knowledge nation is to stop qualified Australian students with high tertiary entrance scores investing in their future education. That is the Labor Party's policy. Its policy is to abolish the opportunities for Australian students to invest in their education while allowing overseas students to invest in these places. It is this government that has opened the doors to Australian universities that were slammed in the face of qualified students by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party. That is why there are now 40,000 more students on Australian campuses than there were when this government came into office. We believe it is the right of qualified students to invest in a university education. I totally reject the insulting language used by the member for Dobell against these students. These are students who have worked for years to gain the qualifications to enter university; they are students that the universities themselves judge -  - Well, the class war rhetoric of the Labor Party is what leads it into policies which exclude qualified students. Let us make it quite clear that the Labor Party wants to give access to Australian universities to foreign students who can pay these fees but is not prepared to allow Australian students to enter universities on the same terms. This government has removed the discrimination against Australian students; we believe that it encourages students to invest in their own education if they are qualified. For the Labor Party to say that it is going to reduce student places to stop qualified students from entering university and to have people believe that it is interested in education and building up knowledge and qualifications shows the utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party and its domination by an ideology shared by a very few.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I appreciate the continuing interest he shows in South Pacific affairs. The meeting held on Friday and Saturday in Samoa was the first ever meeting of the South Pacific Forum foreign ministers and was a historic occasion. It was also an extraordinarily successful meeting. At a difficult time, when there has been a coup in Fiji and a breakdown of administration in the Solomon Islands, there was a strong sense at that meeting of shared responsibility and partnership amongst the forum membership. We have not seen that before in previous regional crises. I was extremely encouraged that all of the ministers - some heads of government were there as well - accepted the need to address these difficult and, frankly, rather sensitive regional issues. For example, the meeting condemned the use of force to overthrow a constitutionally elected government in Fiji. I was heartened by the unanimous support at the meeting for a return to constitutional and democratic government in Fiji. The Fiji interim foreign minister, who was at the meeting, announced that that was his objective on behalf of the interim government there. Ministers also welcomed the ceasefire agreement in the Solomons and expressed warm appreciation for Australia's assistance in facilitating those negotiations. In conclusion, I was pleased that, some weeks ago, more interest was shown in this country - through the media and elsewhere - in South Pacific matters, obviously emanating from the coup in Fiji and the problems in the Solomon Islands. But this meeting was of particular importance in terms of taking forward the whole notion of the Pacific as a region working together to address the whole range of very difficult social, economic and political issues that the region faces. It is in our interest that all these countries should be working so positively with us to try to solve those problems.</DOC>

 - Dear, oh, dear, you can see why he is not being used to develop the knowledge nation! The universities are entitled to admit into their courses qualified students. If a student meets the qualifications for entry, they are entitled to have entry. If you dropped that ridiculous class war rhetoric and got on with education policies, the Labor Party might have something to say in the area.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for the question. The fact is that we have seen a growing interest in the number of people being nominated for temporary residence in Australia on the basis that they have skills that are in high demand. This is very much required to create further job opportunities in Australia for young Australians. Of course, this is a growing demand. The demand for temporary entry visas was up by eight per cent in the year 1999-2000 to somewhere of the order of 77,000 people. This is making a very significant contribution to our economic growth. It does that by filling skill shortages, introducing overseas knowledge and experience and enhancing our ability to compete in overseas markets. That makes it absolutely crucial in economic terms for the benefit of Australia.The fact is that we do have a number of categories under which people can enter Australia as skilled migrants. Some of them are for permanent entry, particularly where there is nomination by employers. Notwithstanding the considerable open-endedness of the number of places available, those places are not all used. In fact, last year we included a contingency reserve for additional employer nominations so that people could come to Australia permanently if they had skills that were going to benefit Australia. The fact is that employers seem to prefer temporary entry because it is responsive, flexible and quick. Of course, the temporary entry arrangements resulted from the consideration of the Roach report, which was initiated by the former government. It is for that reason that I was very surprised to see that at the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party in Hobart the alarm bells were ringing for Australian industry, which wants to bring highly skilled temporary entrants to Australia. It became very clear from the comments of the member for Bowman, Mr Sciacca, that he has very little understanding of the way in which the immigration program operates and has a prejudice against temporary entrants. It is quite clear from the way in which he commented that Labor is about wanting to roll back the beneficial elements of the migration program today. After considering the temporary entry regime, the member for Bowman said, `This is not what the Labor Party is about.' It is clear from those comments that what the Labor Party is about is rolling back any program that is going to be beneficial to Australian industry and create jobs and opportunities for young people. Labor wants to remove the opportunity to bring to Australia those people who are going to help create those opportunities.</DOC>

 - I made it plain yesterday that the commitments made by the government have been delivered in full, and I refer to the document entitled Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system, which outlines in detail our commitments. I am quite certain that the gentleman to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred in his question would have received from the government - and the opposition is well aware of this because it was a matter of some debate -  - I said when I wrote to every household in Australia, including Mr Holmes's household, that I had enclosed a booklet that explained the detail. I can assure Mr Holmes that we have honoured in full those details, as referred to in my covering letter to Mr Holmes and to the other eight million or nine million households throughout Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. After yesterday's great news on private health insurance, the Labor Party cannot wait to get in and attempt to destroy the 30 per cent rebate as, in the words of Graham Richardson, `they do not really like private health cover'. The effects of this proposed change to means test the rebate would be catastrophic. If we look between 1985 and 1996, the drop-out from private health insurance in the top 60 per cent of income earners was 18 per cent. The drop-out amongst low income earners was only three per cent. So high income earners are far more price sensitive when it comes to private health insurance. Any change of this nature would immediately lead to a drop in private health insurance which means that premiums would go up.The Labor Party for the last six months have been trying to weasel and sneak around this. They say, `Yes, we are going to keep the rebate' - wink, wink. Yet, yesterday, the shadow spokesperson on health, the member for Jagajaga, said, `We have not decided whether or not we are going to means test.' This puts an end to the deceptive behaviour of the last six months. We can really see what the Labor Party are on about when it comes to private health insurance.The honourable member asked about the effect of this. The effect is patchy because the number of people with private health insurance is actually not uniform across the country. The latest figures we have of people with private health insurance by electorate are from January 2000. But if we project by the state increase in private health insurance over the last six months we get some interesting figures. In the seat of Paterson, over 45 per cent of the population who have private health insurance are going to be disadvantaged by this change. In the seat of Bass, nearly 47 per cent of the population have private health insurance. In the seat of Dickson, 44½ per cent have private health insurance. In the seat of Griffith, 51.6 per cent of the population have private health insurance. In the seat of Kingston, 53.4 per cent of the population have private health insurance, and in the seat of Chisholm it is 55.3 per cent, which is just a bit above Jagajaga with 53.4 per cent. But the really high numbers come from Western Australia. In the seat of Stirling, 56.7 per cent of the population have private health insurance. In the seat of Swan, 54.2 per cent of the population have private health insurance. So these are the people the Labor Party are attempting to disadvantage, to undo the 4½ years of good work. We do not have a consistent message coming from the Labor Party. They are all over the place. Clearly the New South Wales right wing would like the Labor Party to take a sensible position on this. The opposition leader is clearly not able to do that. He allows his shadow minister to go around undermining a very important part of Medicare. When it comes to private health insurance it is very simple: Labor did not invent the solution, they did not support the solution, they did not want the solution, but they are never going to be allowed to dismantle this.</DOC>

 - The response I would make to Mr Cherrie - and indeed to the four or five other people who will be referred to as question time rolls on - is that I actually wrote to him. I wrote to him in a letter dated 20 June. It was addressed `My fellow Australian'. Had it not been for a court action I would have been able to make it a lot more personal. I would have been able to say `Dear Bill', `Dear Charlie' or `Dear Tom' , but unfortunately I was not able to do that and I had to use that time-honoured and well-respected generic salutation `My fellow Australian'. In that letter I referred to one of the many elements - would you like me to read the whole letter? It is a very good letter. I started off by explaining why it was necessary to break away from the old tax system. I spoke about the $12 billion of personal income tax cuts. And then I got to something that I would have been able to specifically draw to Mr Cherrie's attention - no doubt Mr Cherrie would have read this:Pensions and allowances will rise by four per cent on 1 July and will be guaranteed to remain two per cent above the cost of living.I then went on to say:In addition to increases in pensions and allowances, benefits for older Australians include savings bonuses, capital gains tax concessions, refundable franking credits and the abolition of provisional tax. But not content with that general explanation to Mr Cherrie, I then provided him with a very attractive booklet. And this very attractive booklet is very good. It is worth a read.  - I am indeed grateful to the member for Paterson for confirming that the Labor Party accepts that everybody in Australia received this booklet. Therefore any suggestion that anybody could have been in any doubt as to their entitlement is totally destroyed by your own interjection. It is totally destroyed.  - No amount of vigorous interjection by the Leader of the Opposition at the dispatch box can alter that fact. That destroys every one of the other questions you have organised - all these people who are writing in. If everybody has this document, everybody knows directly from me what the real situation was. So let me read it. Under the heading `Financial breaks: the GST and aged pensioners' - and I have already talked about the increase in the pension - it goes on to say: Pensioners will also benefit - and this includes Mr Cherrie and it includes Mr Holmes - from a 2½ per cent increase in the income test and assets test free areas, allowing you to increase the amount of income or assets you can have before your pension is reduced. It goes on to say:Pensioners will further benefit from keeping 60 cents of every dollar of income above the free area. Under the old system it is only 50 cents. - I will go on reading from the document under the heading `The aged person's savings bonus':Subject to an income test, Australians aged 60 years or over with personal income from savings, superannuation or investment will be eligible for a one-off aged persons savings bonus of a dollar for each dollar of that income. This is up to a maximum of $1,000 for a single person and $1,000 for each couple.The Leader of the Opposition will also be aware of an enormous amount of material that was circulated to Australian households before the election in 1998.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The honourable member would know that, in the last five years when Labor was in office, during a period of constant economic growth, the Labor Party accumulated for this country, for this Commonwealth government, $80 billion worth of debt. They ran deficits over five years and accumulated $80 billion of debt. We must pay tribute to the finance minister at the time, who I think has the record for the greatest two-year accumulative deficits in Australian financial history: $23 billion in two years. When this government was elected we said that we would do three things. We said that we would get the budget into surplus, we would halve the ratio of debt to the economy and we would do it without increasing taxes. As it turned out, we returned the budget to surplus one year ahead of target, after two years, we have done better than halve the debt to GDP ratio and, of Labor's $80 billion of cumulative deficits, we have now repaid $50 billion. We did that without increasing taxes. We saw the extraordinary claim yesterday, reported in the Australian Financial Review,which, as I remarked, must have been going into the comedy business after interviewing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who said that, after the Labor Party has rolled back GST, abolished bracket creep, rolled back fuel excises, paid small business to collect GST, increased spending on health, increased spending on education, increased spending on training, reviewed HECS and increased spending on the regions, it was actually going to run bigger surpluses than the government. Terry McCrann in the Herald Sun today reported it like this:`Labor pledges hefty tax hikes for middle Australia' was the headline you did not see in the Australian Financial Review yesterday, even though this was the most important message out of a cosy interview with Simon Crean.Where would you get the money to cut back the taxation base, increase spending on everything and run a bigger surplus? This is where we need to go to the Labor Party platform. I ask people to remember this very carefully. The Labor Party's platform is this - this is what they put in their platform, very deliberately: they will not increase the burden of taxation on lower and middle income Australians nor seek to raise revenue beyond a proportion of GDP over the past decade. They will not seek to raise revenue beyond a proportion of GDP over the past decade. Over the past decade, the tax to GDP ratio has been 22.5 per cent, but today it is 20.8 per cent. What that means, according to their platform, is a proposal to increase tax to GDP by 1.7 per cent or $12 billion. You would need every one of those 12 billion dollars to possibly be in the ballpark of those promises yesterday: $12 billion is an increase in income tax for every Australian, $12 billion would be something like a 36c a litre increase in excise on petrol, $12 billion would be the abolition of the 30 per cent health rebate and more. No wonder we saw the Labor Party spokeswoman on health yesterday equivocating on the private health rebate of 30 per cent. Ms Macklin said that she was not able to say if Labor would keep the rebate in its current form: `We will just keep watching how it goes,' she said.`We will just keep watching how it goes'! Let me tell you how it goes: 30 per cent out to people who pay private health insurance - that is how it goes. That is how you will be watching it. Any means test on that private health insurance rebate, to save any money, to get to their $12 billion, would have to cut in on middle income earners. Thirty per cent for the average Australian family that loses their 30 per cent rebate means an increase of $700 per annum: $700 per annum every single year under Labor to take out private health insurance. Talk about a bill that will be coming to you courtesy of Beazley, Crean and Macklin! It will be $700 per annum on private health insurance, and that is before the Labor Party have got into their increase in income taxes.The Labor Party did precisely this the last time they won an election, in 1993. I am going to read now the defence in this parliament given by Mr Kim Beazley as to why after winning the 1993 election they were entitled to hike up petrol excise, take away income tax cuts and put up wholesale sales tax, because that is what they did. When he was asked to justify how when they could go through an election without mentioning any of those things they were then entitled after the election to hike petrol excise, to put up income tax and to increase wholesale sales tax, he says this in Hansard on 28 September 1993:The opposition - and that was the coalition - was incapable of getting through the flack of its GST and presenting in the public mind the fact -  and this is the fact - that if a government says it will maintain the current level of taxation as a percentage of GDP, yet its forward estimates on revenue suggest that the revenue will fall, then logically that government will raise revenue somewhere down the line. That was the quote. That was the justification for the increase in the petrol excise, the increase in the wholesale sales tax and the increase in income tax - that, if the forward estimates showed taxation revenue to GDP falling and the then government promised to keep it constant, that government was entitled to increase revenue down the track. And what do we find they do at the ALP conference? - They make the same promise. When the Leader of the Opposition came in here blustering after the 1993 election he was saying, `You weren't clever enough to catch us.' That is what he said: `The opposition was incapable of getting through the flack of its GST.' Well, we are clever enough to catch you this time. You are making the same promise. We know from your statements to this House you think that promise justifies an increase in wholesale sales tax, an increase in income tax and an increase in petroleum excise. The Labor Party did it once; they are planning to do it again. The reason they will not come clean on any policy is if they did it is a $700 bill on private health insurance; it is an increase in income tax. The Labor Party are right back where they always were.</DOC>

 - I will come to some other parts of the honourable member for Griffith's question, but let us get this right. Is the honourable member for Griffith saying that our tax package should have been even more generous? What absolute hypocrisy! The Labor Party vote against every element of our package, and then they have got the nerve to get up there and say it ought to be more generous. - Mr Speaker, I will say again - in case the Leader of the Opposition did not get it - the thrust of the question coming from the member for Griffith is that our taxation package should have been even more generous. Yet the Labor Party voted against it. Don't you remember what you did? Don't you remember that you lined up on the other side and you voted against this? On top of that, you have got Simon Crean saying he is going to have a bigger surplus. How do justify all of that? In relation to promises that were made before the election in 1998, I might remind the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith that the gentleman you referred to in your question would have received from the government in August of 1998, before the election, a document which on page 58 spelt out in minute detail the circumstances of the aged persons retirement bonus. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I can inform the House that registrations in respect of the new tax system have now substantially exceeded those which were forecast by the government. The government originally estimated that 2.1 million people would register for Australian business numbers. To date, there have been 2.6 million registrations. The government originally estimated that there would be 1.4 million businesses registered and to date there have been two million. That shows widespread acceptance of the new taxation system - notwithstanding all of the doom predictions of some in this House, whom I will not name - and that the government's registration machinery was well handled and on track. If I may interpose there, one of the indications of the acceptance of the new taxation system is that the goods and services tax now has bipartisan support in this chamber, with both parties committed, if they were elected at the next election, to keeping it. I welcome the Australian Labor Party's commitment to keeping the goods and services tax and recognition of the wisdom of the government's leadership role in putting it in place.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was geared up from 1 July to handle 100,000 calls per day, but over the period from 1 July to 10 July 2000 it received only 15,000 calls - many fewer than it expected. It conducted a survey of price changes in 1,500 retail outlets and reported that 80 per cent of the products surveyed showed price ranges within the range estimated and that 97 per cent showed price changes of less than 10 per cent. About one-third of prices did not change as a result of the new tax system. I think members of the House would welcome that too, because you will recall that some people predicted everything would go up by 10 per cent or more. I will not go into who made those predictions. The reporting of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was accurate, unlike some other price surveys that were put out at the time. Somebody in this House who put out a price survey - or, should I say, half a price survey - at the time said that it was not his responsibility to put out the full information. He had only a responsibility to put out those prices that had gone up. That was of course the member for Melbourne. - Seeing as he interjects, I could actually refer to his price survey and some of the comments that were made about it. I think the best comment about his price survey was made by a radio commentator who, on 20 July 2000, said:The story that needs to be talked about today is the prices survey of the Labor Party and opposition consumer affairs spokesman, Lindsay Tanner, regarded as one of the bright young things.He would want to look a bit brighter than he did yesterday. That commentator continued:Lindsay Tanner has released parts of the eight months survey only and of course in doing that he got caught. What the Labor Party has simply got to concede is that so far prices have not gone up all that much. I mean, it is always important in politics to be right with the facts. I mean, naturally, if you are going to lie to people you will get into trouble, and it is always going to be the same. And so the Liberals had a field day with Labor last night.Do you know which radio commentator said that? Mr Graham Richardson on 2GB on 20 July. Notwithstanding attempts by some in the Labor Party to put out false facts, as caught out by Richo, the price changes have gone very well. I think members would be aware that there is a proposal to actually roll back the GST. I think the whole of Australia was listening to the Hobart conference waiting for the words `roll back' to come out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. We waited in vain. But small business and business generally have some views on roll-back. Rob Bastian from COSBOA said:Roll-back would increase -   - He likes your proposal, does he? Good. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition cites Rob Bastian as supporting his proposal - Rob Bastian who, on 13 July, said:Roll-back would increase complexity, increase supervision and means increased fear.That is a wonderful endorsement! One of the Labor Party people said, `We are not here to represent small business.' Oh, we did not know how serious you were about that promise. Mr Bastian said:The uncertainty about roll-back has to be addressed. Mr Beazley is taking the usual political stand to keep his powder dry, but that position is not going to help. It is becoming an albatross around his neck.This is the person whom the Deputy Leader of the Opposition cites as his main supporter on roll-back. We would hate to see your opponents, old son, if he is your main supporter. The last thing that the small business council of Australia want, after all the effort and hard work they have put into it, is to have roll-back and more changes. They do not want any more changes. Phil Naylor from the Australian Retailers Association said:I do not think anyone would be really impressed with having to gear up for a new GST. We would like them to explain what they are proposing. We can't see any way you can fiddle with the GST that would make it less complex.Della was right. That is precisely what Della advised them. The reason you do not hear anything about roll-back is that they are in absolute confusion. They have no idea where they are going, let alone how they are going to fund it. They know that the moment they announce their roll-back, with all of its attendant costs, people are going to want to know what their new income tax rises are going to be. This would have to be the worst policy opposition that Australia has seen. They have no policy, no commitment and no credibility and they are going nowhere.</DOC>

 - The member for Fowler refers to a situation where, because of the very understandable practice of people - not because their circumstances haven't changed - not providing, because there is no need for them to do so, up-to-date information to Centrelink, the consequence was that many people were in fact entitled to greater benefits than what they had received from Centrelink, based -  - Hang on! Mr Speaker, I do treat this, unlike some of the others, as a quite serious question, and I am endeavouring to give it a courteous response. - The situation arose because many of the records held by Centrelink were out of date, and, as a result of them being out of date, people were not getting as much as they were entitled to. What the government decided to do was to institute the simplest and easiest approach to ensure that people got their full entitlements. So, far from being condemned, I would have thought the government should be praised for that. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and for his interest in this matter. Queensland Motorways runs a number of tollways in and around Brisbane, including, I understand, the Logan Motorway and the Southern Brisbane bypass. On 1 July, Queensland Motorways raised the tolls at Kuraby, Loganlea and Stapleton Road by between 11.4 per cent and 20 per cent, with an average increase of 13 per cent. Queensland Motorways claimed in public notices, `The modifications to the price will reflect the introduction of the Commonwealth government's 10 per cent GST and minor rounding of coinage.'After receiving complaints from many consumers, as well as the member for Moreton and a number of other members, the ACCC investigated the matter. As it turns out, Queensland Motorways were misleading consumers. Perhaps I should add here who owns Queensland Motorways. It is not a privately owned company; in fact, Queensland Motorways is owned by the Queensland Labor government. After investigation, the ACCC found that the Queensland Labor government had previously refused to increase prices and tried to use the introduction of the GST to hide certain other price increases for consumers. The ACCC caught them out. As compensation for misleading consumers, from midnight tonight there will be no tolls for 24 hours. This is a timely toll-free day because I understand that tomorrow is Brisbane's royal national show day. So it is a toll-free day for some families going out to the show.Why has the Labor Party been involved in misleading consumers? Why is that the case? Why has the Queensland state government tried to hide increases behind the GST when other toll roads did not try to do it at the end of the day when it applied to consumers? It seems to be the case that, every which way, the Labor Party tries to hide its true policies. In this case, consumers have caught the Queensland state Labor government out, and they will get the benefits of that from midnight tonight.</DOC>

 - The commitment made before the election was that the price of petrol need not rise as a result of the GST. -  - In monitoring movements in petrol prices, I prefer to rely on the assessments made by the ACCC. The ACCC monitored petrol prices in the week preceding the introduction of the new tax system and compared them with price rises after 1 July. I would have thought that, if you were endeavouring to assess the impact of the GST, it is the movements immediately after the introduction of the GST that would be relevant.The survey of approximately 4,000 service stations across Australia found that on average the major capital city price of unleaded petrol actually fell by 0.4c a litre following the introduction of the GST. Let me repeat that: the survey of approximately 4,000 service stations across Australia found that on average the major capital city price of unleaded petrol actually fell by 0.4c a litre. I heard what Mr McIntosh had to say, and I can respond only by referring to a survey carried out by the ACCC which disclosed that there was in fact a fall of 0.4c a litre in the days following the introduction of the goods and services tax. According to the Shell web site, the refinery price of petrol has increased subsequently by more than 6c a litre since 30 June. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to the Australian Automobile Association press release by Mr McIntosh. The ACCC appears not to have taken into account exchange rate effects. The Australian dollar has depreciated by more than two per cent since the end of June. There have also been lags in the flowthrough of oil price changes to Australian petrol prices and also the retail discounting cycle. I do not accept the claims made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I study remarks made by Mr Lauchlan McIntosh and the AAA. I do not give them any greater credence than that. When it comes to surveying price movements in Australia I prefer to rely on the ACCC, and the latest information from the ACCC is that in the days following the introduction of the GST the price of petrol actually fell.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can assure you that there are no alternative schemes. The Labor Party never had a scheme when they were in government. In fact, so uninterested were they in the plight of workers in this situation that they did not even collect the statistics. They were truly the forgotten people. They were in fact hidden away, never of any interest to the Labor Party in government. The government has acted decisively to extend the social welfare safety net to provide assistance to workers who find themselves out of a job and out of their entitlements. I am pleased to inform the House that, since the commencement of the scheme on 1 January, $747,151 has been paid out to 214 successful claimants. This is 214 more people helped by this government than were ever contemplated for help when Labor were in office.The Labor Party might be interested to know that we have had 2,000 former employees from 189 companies make a claim for assistance. I would hope that they would be interested to know this because under our scheme we are prepared to help these workers. The Labor Party have a deliberate campaign to ensure that no state government in the country on the Labor side is prepared to help these workers. This is one of the most disgraceful, cynical exploitations of the needs of workers for party political interests that we have ever seen in this country. This matter was on at the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party and, instead of having a debate about the needs of workers, they deliberately set out to gag debate because they did not want to be seen to be opposed to the interests of workers. Not only was I listening but also I heard an explanation for your disgraceful conduct from the man who likes to tell all - none other than John Della Bosca. What he said reveals the utter cynicism of you people. He said:We cannot allow the Peter Reith scheme to be let off the hook for what it is. We cannot allow accidentally to endorse that scheme. We cannot allow accidentally to in any way or sense create a view that Labor governments in the state jurisdictions would be cooperating with the scheme.In other words, bad luck to the workers. It would be an embarrassment for the Labor Party to in any way be associated with a measure that actually helps workers. You are so concerned about your political interests that, when it comes to supporting workers, what does John Della Bosca say? He makes it pretty clear. He says that it would be an embarrassment for the Labor Party if anybody supported a scheme to help workers, so they will gag debate and sweep under the carpet the concerns of workers who have missed out because it is inconvenient for the Labor Party. When you look to Queensland, the gag is on there as well. I have a letter here from the office of the Premier dated 11 July to a worker who is with a business called the Cooroy Private Hospital. He is asking, `Is the state government prepared to help us?' What does the Queensland government say? It says that it is considering this request and will make a decision as quickly as possible. Labor have a policy to encourage the state governments to dupe people into thinking they might have a chance when John Della Bosca has made it quite clear that they got the fix in so no worker gets the help they need. We are proud of the fact that we saw a need and were prepared to help workers. It is a sad indictment on the Labor Party. You are run by the union bosses. I met a group of Victorian workers who could not understand why they supported the Labor Party's election in the state of Victoria, because when they were in need the state Labor government, at your request, was not prepared to pay a dollar to help them. It is a disgrace to the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question. I am aware of positive comments recently made about the government's schools policies. These comments relate to a school in the electorate of Isaacs, one Lyndhurst College. Lyndhurst College is a beneficiary of a number of Howard government school policies. - Lyndhurst College is an example of a school which has benefited enormously from the Howard government's commitment to the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go on direct from school to university. The college has been the beneficiary of Commonwealth funded job placement officers under the ASTF; it has been a beneficiary of the Jobs Pathway Program; it has been part of a cluster under the full-service schools initiative; and it has received Commonwealth Vocational Education in Schools funds. As a result of these funds and the leadership of the principal and teachers at the school, the retention rates at that school have improved greatly. Indeed, a recent visitor to the school was so impressed that he wrote an article for the Melbourne Age. I quote from the article:Lyndhurst Secondary College now has a year 12 retention rate of 80 per cent and a tertiary entrance rate of 62 per cent ... It is a great example of what can be achieved when schools, government and communities work together to solve a problem.Now who said that? Who do you think said that? It was the Leader of the Opposition. It was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. He was so enthused with the consequences of government policies for Lyndhurst College that he called a press conference. But, unable to contain himself, he went out and told the press, `Schools like this and the programs in these schools are the building blocks of the knowledge nation.' So he is not only frantically downloading policies from Tony Blair; he is frantically downloading policies from us because he is so devoid of knowledge about what is happening in this country, he is so devoid of awareness of what government policies are doing for tens of thousands of students in schools around Australia. But when he finally gets to a school and finds out what is happening he calls a press conference to endorse the government's policies and to say that these are leading to the building blocks of the knowledge nation.This is the Leader of the Opposition who, as we know, has had no interest in education since he was minister for education. He said to his biographer these very truthful words: `When I was minister for education I thought there was less to do in this portfolio than in any other portfolio I had had.' We are just waiting now to see if he can get himself over the hump, whether he can go along with a policy which he should know works for young people - the literacy assessment and literacy benchmarks - and whether he has the strength to stand up to the education unions. I think we will be waiting a long time. But he is welcome to all our good policies. Forget Tony Blair: our policies are way ahead of anything that you will find in the United Kingdom.</DOC>

 - No. The government has dramatically reduced excise on petrol and diesel by several billion dollars. Not only have we reduced the excise on petrol itself by 6.7c a litre but, if you happen to be a long distance haulier - that is, on interstate haulage - you pay 24c a litre less in diesel; if you happen to be in medium sized trucks between 4.5 tonnes and 20 tonnes, you get diesel fuel grants; if you happen to be in rail, you get a full refund of the diesel fuel excise which you never had before; and if you happen to be in marine, you get full rebate of the diesel excise which you never had before.  - The first point I made was that excises on petrol and on diesel had fallen. The excise has fallen by about 2.4 billion and the tax collected on the industry as a whole has also fallen. It has fallen not only because of those cuts but also because everybody in that industry now gets a full rebate of all input taxes, which they never had before. The overall takeout of the petrol and diesel industry has reduced.I know that the honourable member for Hunter would try to make a political point of this. I would refer the House to an interview he did on 2NM with Chris Lewis on 24 July 2000 when he said: Well, my point is this: petrol prices have been an issue for decades. At every election they become an election issue, but after the election the problem remains no matter who wins.That is what he said on Hunter radio. This is one of the most cynical campaigns I have ever seen. I will just make the point that, in March 1983 when the Labor Party came to office, petrol excise - wait for it - was 6.1c a litre, but when the Labor Party left office in 1996 petrol excise was 33c a litre. It went from 6c to 33c. This is the only government that has not increased petrol excise other than by indexation, and the indexation that is applied is the indexation which was legislated for 17 years ago by a Labor Party. So when the Labor Party comes in, petrol excise is at 6c; it legislates to increase it; it legislates indexation; and it goes out with petrol at 33c. This government does not increase the petrol excise. It reduces the excise by 6.7c; it gives rebates on diesel; and it takes tax off the overall industry. The Labor Party today is going to try to run an MPI on petrol because, as the member for Hunter said, `We can always make it an election issue but we know that thereafter nothing will ever be done about it.' </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question and the interest he shows in the situation in East and West Timor, which I know many members are interested in. The government is understandably deeply concerned over recent militia attacks, including the killing of two peacekeepers on the East and West Timor border. Indonesia has the ultimate responsibility for ending the incursions into East Timor, and our government continues to urge the Indonesian government and TNI in particular to redouble their efforts and take all necessary steps to end militia activity in West Timor. We have made numerous representations to the government of Indonesia along these lines; indeed on 29 July I spoke to Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab about precisely that. Resolution of the border security situation partly depends on resolving the refugee camps issue. We welcome the Indonesian government's proposal to close the refugee camps as a step in the right direction. Importantly, Indonesia has acknowledged that dealing effectively with the camps is fundamental to solving the problem of militia activity. We are giving a high priority to discussions with the Indonesian government, the UN and other members of the international community to explore the difficult practical steps needed to implement Indonesia's proposal. The government of Indonesia must provide effective security to ensure that there is no militia intimidation and that there is unimpeded access to camps for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and a credible registration process. It is crucial that the refugees are able to exercise their choice on resettlement in Indonesia or repatriation to East Timor, free of any intimidation.Australia is of course ready to offer constructive assistance to both Indonesia and to East Timor. We have already provided $7½ million to assist people in camps and facilitate their return to East Timor. We are prepared to do considerably more. </DOC>

 - This continues an opportunistic line of questioning from the other side of the House. Their interest in matters rural is very touching, and I will come to that in a moment. But the first point I want to make is to reinforce what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have said, which is that our overall take on excise is down by about $2.2 billion. Let's emphasise that again: the government are reducing taxes on fuel by about $2.2 billion. Add to that the $500 million that we are putting into ensuring that the introduction of the GST does not introduce further inequalities between country and city prices, and you can see that the government have a story here they can be proud of. Let me make one point here, firstly. It is an important one and it is this: no-one rejoices in the fact that right across the globe at the moment, as a result of high crude oil prices, petrol prices are very high. It is worth noting that we have seen a 47 per cent increase in the price of crude in recent months; but, despite that, in fact the price of petrol in Australia is the fourth lowest in the world. Compare that with the report of some English farmers I met a little while ago, for example: it is about half what it is in that country.The particular point that the member raised that needs addressing is that he clearly sought to imply that country motorists were somehow worse off as a result of our policy approach. The fact of the matter is that the Australia-wide differential has narrowed. It is considerably narrower now than it was 12 months ago, as a result of the government's policies. Indeed, the most superficial glance across a whole range of centres in rural and regional Australia will show that the differential has continued to narrow. It has narrowed more since the introduction of the new taxation arrangements.The fact of the matter is that, unlike those opposite, we are reducing the collection of excise. You never, for example, made the excise or, in this case, the GST on business petrol rebatable. We have; it is rebatable under us. But you want to roll that back; you want to roll back our excise reforms. You are about, as the shadow spokesman for Treasury matters has made quite plain, reintroducing the old indirect taxation mix on fuel. That is what he said. He supports the old mix. He wants to go back to the days of the ALP, under whom we saw a 500 per cent increase in excise. It is opportunism exposed. The fact of the matter is that you are about rolling back our taxation reductions on fuel - and they are reductions, in answer to your question - because you will not be able to meet the commitments that you have so irresponsibly made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I note that in her electorate unemployment has come down from over 11 per cent some years back to just 5.6 per cent now. That is a great improvement, but I want to assure the member for Petrie that the government is certainly not resting on its laurels.The government's principal program for helping long-term unemployed people is intensive assistance under the Job Network. Mr Speaker, if you compare intensive assistance employment outcome rates with outcomes under the former government's Working Nation program, intensive assistance is actually 30 per cent better at helping long-term unemployed than Working Nation programs. Intensive assistance is 50 per cent better at helping very long-term unemployed people than Working Nation programs. The consistent falls in the number of long-term unemployed people under this government show that the government's programs are working.There are 185,000 long-term unemployed Australians now. Of course, that is still too many, but it is down 20 per cent since March 1996 and it is down 50 per cent from July 1993. Who was the minister for employment then, I wonder. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment when long-term unemployment peaked at its all-time high of 350,000 - and what does he know about jobs now that he did not know then when he was the minister?If you look at the Labor Party's conference, there are two proposals for dealing with unemployment. The first is to abolish Work for the Dole, despite its proven success. The second is to establish a Clayton's Job Network which destroys everything about that great scheme, except its name, despite its proven success. There were over one million Australians unemployed when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. I noticed that at the recent Labor Party conference the unionist John Coombes eulogised, or attempted to eulogise, the Leader of the Opposition as, in his own words, `a very adequate leader'. He described the Leader of the Opposition as `a very adequate leader'. But when it comes to unemployment, the Leader of the Opposition is a proven professional failure. </DOC>

 - We will give the benefit of the doubt and say that the question involved a thorough misunderstanding - no doubt written by somebody else, but showing a thorough misunderstanding. In relation to banks, banks are input taxed. That is, banks do not charge GST on their outputs, and they are not entitled to claim input tax credits as a consequence. I do not know if the Labor Party policy is to do a different one under its GST. I do not know if the Labor Party proposes to have a different treatment under its GST. But I do know that the Labor Party was opposed to bringing banks fully into the GST system. Some of the banks say that, as a result of that, in order to defend their profit margins, they intend to recover 0.02 per cent on mortgages.From my own point of view, I think that the banks can protect their profit margins in all sorts of other areas, including the fact that all of the banks have had a reduction in company tax from 36 per cent to 34 per cent, and all of the banks will have a further cut in company tax from 34 per cent to 30 per cent on 1 July. I also think that the banks have had other advantages, including the abolition of non-callable deposits. But if you were a banker and you said, notwithstanding those tax cuts, you wanted to protect your profit line as a result of input taxation, you could be looking at an increase of 0.02 per cent or, as one of the banks did, 0.01 per cent. The cost of that on the average loan is $2 a month. Let's get this in perspective. At 0.02 per cent, it would be $2 a month, and at 0.01 per cent it would be $1 a month. As part of this tax reform on the other side, not only have I referred to the cuts in company tax but also, of course, financial institutions duty is going to be abolished in totality. -  - No, on 1 July 2001, and it would have been earlier if the Labor Party had not succeeded in blocking the change in the Senate. In addition to the abolition of the financial institutions duty - which will outweigh by a considerable amount a dollar a month on the average mortgage, I would have thought - as a result of tax changes, the bank account debits tax will be abolished. Again, there is delay, and we can say that the Labor Party was successful in the Senate in again delaying the abolition of the bank account debits tax. - No, I am sorry. There would not have needed to be a deal with the Democrats if the Labor Party had not voted against every single tax reform. It is all very nice of the Labor Party to say that this is a consequence of the Australian Democrats. Let us make this clear: the Australian Democrat vote would not have been required in the Senate if the Labor Party had not been voting against it. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of financial institutions duty. Do I have to make that clear? The Labor Party opposed the abolition of the bank account debits tax. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duties on shares. The Labor Party opposed the abolition of stamp duties on mortgages. The only reason Democrat votes became necessary in the Senate, need I remind the Australian Labor Party, is that the Labor Party voted against every bill and opposed the income tax cuts. After voting against the goods and services tax, they now support it. I asked the question yesterday: is there any party in this parliament who wants to repeal the GST? It is an amazing way to quieten the opposition. The Labor Party think it is a trick question. Do you propose to abolish the GST? They think, `Trick question. Don't answer that question.' Is it yes or is it no? The Labor Party voted against GST, now they are in favour of it. It was only because they voted against the GST and tax reform that the deal with the Democrats -  - Oh, he did not. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said he didn't vote against tax reform.  - Good heavens. He didn't vote against tax reform. - I have been in this parliament for three years and what has absolutely escaped me is that the Labor Party supported tax reform. All that time they were secretly in favour of the GST. All that time they were secretly in favour of surplus budgets; they were just voting against every savings measure. They would not know whether they were coming or going. If they had had their way, we would not be abolishing the financial institutions duty or the bank account debits tax, which will more than outweigh input taxation. If the honourable member for Scullin really is against input taxation with GST on financial institutions, as part of his roll-back he can announce where he actually stands, we will cost it for him and we will work out how much income tax rise would be required to pay it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his interest in agriculture, particularly agricultural exports from Victoria. Obviously, there have been tremendous benefits and many advances for agriculture as a result of this government's policies over recent times. A billion dollars worth of cuts in taxation on agricultural performance have already produced significant benefits for Australian farmers. Employment growth in agriculture has been quite significant over recent times, and in several states agriculture is the biggest creator of new jobs. Agriculture is certainly benefiting from the policies put in place by this government.In relation to exports, again the performance of agriculture has been outstanding. Latest figures show farm production at around $29 billion, with $23 billion worth of exports. Rural exports over the first four months of the year 2000 have totalled almost $8 billion, and that is 11 per cent up on the same time last year. Wool exports are up by 31 per cent, and quite a few of those would be from the electorate of the honourable member. Meat is up eight per cent, and other rural products are up 13 per cent. We achieved $1.3 billion worth of wine exports last year - another example of extraordinary growth. The live sheep trade, which ended in 1989 under the previous government, has now resumed. The trial shipments have been successful and that trade will now prosper and obviously provide significant benefits for regional Australia. The government's $24 million pork industry restructuring program has led to a remarkable turnaround in that industry with record exports, and I might add that imports have been down very substantially in the last few months.It is a particularly appropriate time for the honourable member to ask whether there are any alternative agricultural policies around, because we have just had the once in a parliament experience of the opposition having their convention in Hobart. So if there were any alternative policies around, you would expect we would have heard something of them in the last few weeks. But I have searched high and low through the web sites and all the other published material that came out of the Labor Party conference and I cannot find any reference at all to an agriculture policy. We are having a knowledge nation, but there is no reference to any knowledge as far as agriculture is concerned. The honourable member for Corio did not even get a slot in the speaking times to tell us anything about agriculture. He had to sit there while the Leader of the Opposition was talking about tax increases and all these other things, but there was not a mention of what is going on in agriculture. I heard the Treasurer comment earlier about how the word `roll-back' was missing from the agenda of the ALP conference.  - The Deputy Leader said that it wasn't missing.  - I want to assure the House that roll-back was not missing from the ALP conference. When it came to agriculture policy, Labor never ever had much but it got rolled back even further, rolled back right to oblivion. Roll-back is alive and well when it comes to the Labor Party's approach to agriculture. There were no policies. There will be no policies. That is why agriculture is so dependent upon having a coalition government for its prosperity into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He has long had an interest in intelligent and compassionate reform of Australia's welfare system. This report is all of a piece with that goal. The Labor Party's life is filled with disappointment. They thought the world was going to come to an end with tax reform on 1 July and they were wrong, and they thought the world was going to come to an end with welfare reform and can I tell them that they are wrong on that again. We are not in the business of cutting benefits for needy Australians; we never have been and we never will be. Needy Australians will always be protected under this government.We are equally determined to ensure that, where it is possible to do so, greater encouragement and help is given to people on welfare to return to the work force. It is a fundamental given of our welfare system that the more you can do to prepare people on welfare for re-entering the work force, the better are the future prospects of those people and their families. On behalf of the government I want to thank Mr Patrick McClure and the other members of the group that put together this report. It is an excellent document. The government endorse the broad thrust of the goals outlined. As the Minister for Community Services indicated, we will be giving a detailed response. We will examine all of the recommendations and I repeat the assurances previously given that the social security safety net will remain. The Labor Party predicted 4½ years ago that it would be taken away. It has not been. In fact we have created opportunities for 800,000 more Australians. Our policies have enabled people to get off welfare in a dignified, life enhancing way - that is, by finding work. The best gift you can give to people on welfare is a job, and there are 809,000 success stories in this country as a result of the policies of this government. Just as you were wrong about tax reform, you are wrong, wrong and wrong again about welfare reform.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that the member for Lilley should be asking questions about child care. Certainly the indicative evidence that we have received since the new child-care benefit has come in is that more families are receiving increased child-care assistance and more centres are almost reaching full capacity due to the increase in child-care benefit. There are a number of child-care centres, including the Gumnut Child-Care Centre in Sale in the member for Gippsland's electorate, where there has been a huge increase in the interest of child care. In Merimbula in Smarties Long Day Care Centre there has also been a large increase. Interestingly, St Paul's Lutheran Child-Care Centre - and you may know that one, member for Lilley, because it happens to be in your electorate - have noticed a big difference in that they are now full. There have been no fee increases, parents are happy and things are a lot better. The tax system has demonstrated that with the increases in family assistance and the substantial increases in child-care benefits, Australian families are much better off with the introduction of the new tax system - not to mention the substantial reductions in personal income taxes that they have been receiving. Indeed that is why it takes a coalition government, a Liberal-National Party government, to embark on welfare reform, recognising that we do not want to see people trapped in welfare dependency where it is becoming intergenerational, which was ingrained when the Australian Labor Party had stewardship of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I can inform her that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment increased by another 3.1 per cent in August to 114 per cent, coming on the back of an 18 per cent increase in the previous two months. Westpac itself described this as a surprising jump. In commenting on it, Mr Bill Evans said this:One can only assume that the strength in the index has been due to consumers reinforcing their initial positive response to the new tax package.I do not think that Mr Bill Evans would mind me saying that he has not been the most effusive supporter of the government and its policies, but that is the comment that he made. One can only assume that the strength of the index has been due to consumers reinforcing their initial positive response. He says:The July consumer survey was conducted only one week into the new tax package. There are risks that the positive response would be reversed, but this survey indicates that, after six weeks to assess the package, consumers appear to have become even more comfortable with new arrangements.Isn't that good news. The reform of the Australian tax system has now been greeted with a huge surge in consumer confidence and, as time goes by, consumers get more confident of their position as it improves.I am asked whether I could comment on any alternatives to that. The first thing I should say is that there has been a quantum leap in this parliament. Since we got up in June, the Australian Labor Party, which used to oppose goods and services tax, have now become a supporter. We welcome their support for goods and services tax, and we thank them very much. I do not think the occasion should pass without us recording that the Australian Labor Party, along with the government of Swaziland, were the last defender of wholesale sales tax in the modern world. But even they have been modernised, notwithstanding the Whitlamite leadership of Beazley and Crean. What would be a threat to the positive response of this new taxation system? - The shadow minister for education interjects. You have forgotten that the tactic is that you are supposed to turn around and talk to each other when I give an answer. That was the tactic you were engaging in just for a moment. We welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition now joins us and listens to the answer. What a wonderful thing that you are now a supporter of goods and services tax. You are now no longer supporting wholesale sales tax.  - The modernisation of the Australian Labor Party - beating the government of Swaziland as the second last political movement into the modern world - means they have now come to support the goods and services tax. We welcome it. The only thing we would like to say is that it took them so long to do it. As the Prime Minister says on welfare reform: Let me make a prediction. The Labor Party will oppose welfare reform to its last dying gasp, and, when it is successful, say, `We were always in favour of it. In fact, we would have gone further.'It is like the surplus. After voting against every single savings measure, after first denying the budget was in deficit, after secondly saying that we would go into recession if the budget was balanced, after thirdly voting against every savings measure, the Labor Party says - guess what? - that they were in favour of bigger surpluses all along.Yesterday we had the most amazing performance from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who alleged in this place that he had supported tax reform. He nods again. He has always been a supporter of tax reform. From 1 July of this year he became a supporter of tax reform. This is a lazy political movement. The Australian Labor Party can lead nowhere, it has no ideas, it is the greatest threat to the modernisation of the Australian economy, and it must really be regretting the positive consumer sentiment which has greeted a much better tax system for Australia.</DOC>

 - I am glad you are taking an interest in the McClure report. It is an area in which you took very little interest in the 13 years you were in government. What I am interested in is what areas, particularly in welfare reform, will you be rolling back - or will you be rolling forward? The only thing that is predictable about the Australian Labor Party is that you have rolled over on policy issues - you are bereft of policies; you do not have any policies.The Prime Minister has said consistently that the welfare reform process is about assisting people, about building greater capacity; it is about not looking at people's disabilities but looking at their capacity; it is about assisting mature age unemployed people and the long-term unemployed; it is about looking at new ways of helping lone parents, at new ways of building greater capacity for sole parents - particularly for the disabled. Obviously you are not interested. Watching the press conference, the Leader of the Opposition was pretty bereft of any novel ideas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. I can report to the House that share ownership in Australia today is wider than ever before and that Australia has the highest level of direct share ownership in the world. In 1997, 20.4 per cent of adult Australians owned shares directly. By 1988 it was 31.9 per cent and, according to the Australian Stock Exchange, today 40.6 per cent of adult Australians own shares directly. That is the highest level in the world, with the UK at 39 per cent, the US at 32 per cent and New Zealand at 31 per cent.Undoubtedly what has attracted people to share ownership in Australia is the number of first-time floats, with the NRMA bringing in 300,000 new shareholders for the first time. The first tranche of Telstra added 560,000 new shareholders to Australia, and the second tranche of Telstra added 320,000 shareholders. Nearly one million Australians were enfranchised as shareholders by the float of Telstra. Today the all-ordinaries index has reached an all-time Australian record intraday high of around 3,298. I notice that the Australian Labor Party has now adopted as a policy the fact that it wants to increase share ownership. As Michael Gordon, Phillip Hudson and Darren Gray reported in the Age on 8 July: The Labor Party will commit itself to promote share ownership for the first time in its history ...We welcome that. That is the Labor Party supporting another one of our policies. Let us make this observation: if you wanted to increase share ownership amongst the Australian public, the greatest single thing you could do would be to float the remaining part of Telstra. The first and second tranches of Telstra brought in a million new shareholders. Labor is now in favour of promoting share ownership. Labor should support the privatisation of Telstra. Did I say `should support'? There is a respectable view that Labor does support the privatisation of the rest of Telstra. I welcome the Financial Review's interview with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `Simply Simon', where he was asked about these matters on Monday. The Financial Review is now expanding its readership with a comedy column called `Simply Simon'. This was very revealing. It says:... he is ... grappling with contradictory elements of Labor policy such as those relating to the sale of Telstra and GST. - All I was doing was quoting from a story called `Simply Simon' in the Australian Financial Review of 14 August. It said:... he is ... grappling with contradictory elements of Labor policy such as those relating to the sale of Telstra and GST. He goes off the record quite often to express a personal view, or to expand on reasons for policy constraints ...All we would like to know is what he told the Financial Review off the record. He comes to Telstra and the GST and he goes off the record to express a personal view. There may be some Labor backbenchers who really believe that if Labor got into government it would oppose the sale of the remaining part of Telstra, but I do not think there are any Labor frontbenchers who believe that. There may be people who say for the sake of the record that the Labor Party will not privatise Telstra, but off the record they say something completely different. Those of us who have been around for a while remember Labor members pledging on their hearts that Australian Airlines would never be privatised and that the Commonwealth Bank would never be privatised, and we know that in relation to Telstra `off the record' is what counts and not what is on the record.All we would ask is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tell us what he has told the Financial Review and, what is more, that he tell the Australian public what he has told the Financial Review. There is one way that Labor can marry its new commitment to full share ownership and that is to get behind the government, to support it on privatisation and give all Australians the opportunity to own a piece of the stock market.'</DOC>

 - We can certainly see the tactics of the Australian Labor Party today. These are the only tactics they know: if they cannot convince people they try to confuse people, and if they cannot confuse people they try to scare people. That is no doubt exactly what all the questions will be about for the rest of question time today. What the Prime Minister and the government have said is that we welcome the McClure report. We are about maintaining a sustainable and adequate safety net for people who are in genuine need, but we also recognise that we have to do more. That is why we commissioned the report. The coalition government commissioned a welfare reform report, not you. We realise we need to do more for opportunities for social and economic participation. The Australian Labor Party want - and this is what their whole policy platform is about - to allow many people trapped in welfare dependency to languish on that support. That is why it takes a National-Liberal Party government to provide a framework for sustainable welfare reform, and that is exactly what the government will be doing when we respond to the McClure report in due course. </DOC>

 - We will tell them what we have done to reduce the taxation burden on fuel - and we will keep on telling them. I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I certainly point to the fact that over five budgets now we have done a great deal for rural and regional Australia. I will also point out that Labor's tax policy platform is remarkably devoid of practical detail and solutions. But I will say this: we do know that their approach to taxation would be a real threat to rural and regional Australia. Whether you want to talk about our reforms that have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in interest costs, lower inflation and so forth to rural and regional Australia; whether you want to talk about the $1.5 billion that has gone into the Natural Heritage Trust, the $1 billion that has gone into the Telstra social bonus, including Networking the Nation, the $800 million that has now gone into Agriculture Advancing Australia with income support, farm business skills development, support for intergenerational farm transfer and farm management deposits; whether you want to talk about our delivery in areas such as quarantine, drought relief or meat inspection; whether you want to talk about services such as Medicare Easyclaim, higher service delivery standards for Telstra, extending the USO to digital data line for Internet, new mobile phone services after you contracted to close the analog system down, rural transaction centres, rural health programs, the Bendigo Bank and other community banking ventures, the Job Network for hundreds of country towns; or whether you want to talk about the $1.8 billion, including major regional initiatives in the last budget, the $90 million rural and regional solutions fund or the education initiatives, the fact is that, in terms of practical outcomes for rural and regional Australia, we have done a great deal. You can add to that, of course, the invaluable contribution now made by tax reform, with a massive slashing - around $2 billion in all - of taxes on transport, and the fact that we support the abolition of indirect taxation on exports. They do not. We are up against a Labor alternative. At last we have seen something from them and I have it here. I suppose I can offer to table it, but there is not much in it. Do you think I should?  - We can table it, all right. We waited for a very long time, amidst a lot of rhetoric, while the member for Dickson was huffing and puffing to bring forth a regional policy statement, put together and researched extensively during those two trips to regional Australia. We waited while the member for Batman was supposed to write a policy from his suburban office in Melbourne. Now we see the platform, we can see that there is no policy. The Leader of the Opposition, it has to be said, gave it all away. He gave his major policy speech down there at the Hobart conference but he made no reference at all to a regional policy initiative, let alone any mention of regional Australia. None. That is perhaps not surprising because there was no policy to launch.  Labor's platform talks about believing in this, acknowledging that and recognising the other. It is long on motherhood but it is missing when it comes to solutions. So we can ask some questions. Does the ALP support continuing the Medicare Easyclaim facilities? Do they support them? Do they support rural transaction centres? Do they support them? Do you support putting more doctors in rural areas and, if so, how? What attitude will you take on long distance education? What will you do on the question of telecommunications services? Silence: there is nothing in your platform at all. But what we do know is that you support higher taxes, as the Treasurer has clearly identified. What we do remember is what it was like when Labor was in charge. We had surging debt, we had surging interest rates and we had surging inflation. Indeed, the only conclusion you can draw is that Labor's solution to the problems of regional Australia is simple: you make it too expensive to live there.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for her question. What the member for Dickson needs to understand is that the percentage of long-term unemployed job seekers in Intensive Assistance, which is our main program for hard-to-help job seekers, is in fact slightly higher than the percentage of long-term job seekers who were in Working Nation programs in 1995, so we are doing more and better for long-term job seekers now than members opposite did when they were in government. Intensive Assistance is our main program for long-term job seekers, but it is certainly not the only one. There is Work for the Dole: there are 50,000 Work for the Dole places a year. There is Jobsearch: there are 90,000 Jobsearch training places a year. There is the Community Support Program: there are 15,000 of those a year. And then there are other things that long-term job seekers do under mutual obligation. I think that the government's record with long-term job seekers should be judged on -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This government should be judged on its record. The number of long-term unemployed is currently 178,000. Obviously that is too high. But the numbers of long-term unemployed are down 18 per cent on March 1996 and they are down 50 per cent on May 1993, when the minister for employment was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. If you are asking us about mature age job seekers, mature age job seekers constitute 20 per cent of the job seeker cohort, 30 per cent of intensive assistance commencements and 25 per cent of intensive assistance outcomes. As I said, 30 per cent of intensive assistance commencements are mature age. This compares with just 15 per cent of New Work Opportunities commencements being mature age job seekers, 12 per cent of Jobstart commencements being mature age job seekers, 16 per cent of Jobtrain commencements being mature age and 19 per cent of Skillshare commencements being mature age. So not only are we helping long-term job seekers better than members opposite ever did; we are helping mature age job seekers better than members opposite ever did. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. Agreement making and whether or not you can have an agreement at work as an individual is a pretty important question because it refers to how flexible a system we will have in the future. It has been generally agreed that a more flexible system means higher productivity. If we have higher productivity we can enjoy higher wages. In the federal system, as people know, we have AWAs. I am pleased to report to the House that the number of AWAs filed over the last three months is 59 per cent higher than for the same months in 1999. Despite the efforts of the Labor Party to kill them off or reduce them by uncertainty, they are extremely popular. They are growing in number - about 5,036 in the month of July. There is a widening usage of AWAs because they are common sense. They are good for employers, and good for employees because they earn more. The whole idea of individual agreements may be anathema to the union movement but they provide opportunities for higher wages for workers. That is why the member for Curtin's question is pretty interesting. There is now quite a debate going on within the Labor Party in Western Australia, her home state, about the use of individual agreements. As reported in the Perth edition of the Australian this morning, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Gallop, is advocating individual agreements in Western Australia. I qualify that by saying he will probably do a Beattie on them and basically knock them over anyway, which is what has happened in Queensland. But all the same, credit where credit is duehe at least has been prepared to say: What we are looking for is a system that recognises the flexibilities you need. He makes that statement in support of the idea of having individual agreements. The reason he does that is pretty clear. In Western Australia in the mining industry we have seen the use of a lot of agreements, and they have been very good news for everybody in the industry. This is what the Chamber of Minerals and Energy has had to say about AWAs and individual agreements: Workplace agreements under Western Australian labour relations legislation have been embraced by the industry. Labour relations within the WA industry have improved significantly in recent years, industrial disputes have declined, work practices are more flexible and more attuned to the particular needs of individual enterprises, pay and productivity are much higher. The changes that have resulted from the implementation of workplace agreements are to the benefit of employers, employees and the broader community. Even Geoff Gallop, the Labor Party leader in Western Australia, has now publicly acknowledged the good sense of that statement. That just shows you what economic vandalism it is for the federal Leader of the Opposition to roll over to the unions and to undertake to implement a bizarre policy in a modern economy, and that is to reject the option for workers to have individual agreements. It is about time the member for Brand listened to good sense on this issue of the need for flexibilities acknowledged by Dr Gallop. Don't hold your breath everybody, but just for once in your life why don't you stand up for the rights of workers to have a choice, to be able to choose to have higher productivity and higher take-home pay? </DOC>

 - I can assure the House that the most compassionate thing anyone can do for a job seeker is get that person a job. The next most compassionate thing you can do is put that person into a program that will get them a job - and that is precisely what this government is doing. I can guarantee that the changes that the government is contemplating are designed to boost the social cohesion of this nation. The changes that we are looking at are designed to produce happier and more fulfilled individuals living in more dynamic communities. What this government is on about is renewing the threads of kinship and common purpose that constitute the social fabric of a great democracy. That is what we are doing. - Thank you, Prime Minister. What the member for Dickson is doing is peddling a lie that this government is somehow victimising job seekers. We are not. The member for Dickson is peddling a lie that job seekers face an $800 fine -  - Peddling an untruth that this government is fining job seekers -  - The member for Dickson is suggesting that this government is imposing $800 fines on people who do not turn up for interviews because, for instance, they might have a sick child. This is completely untrue. We do not breach anyone who has a reasonable excuse. What the member for Dickson and her allies are suggesting is a smear against the 22,000 good people who work in Centrelink who are doing their best to help the job seekers of this country, who deserve support and not the kind of smear that is coming from the member for Dickson.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Medicare is a system of health financing. It does leave gaps in health care such that, if they are not addressed specifically, the public certainly misses out. There are eight areas where Medicare needs specific strengthening as a method of health care financing. They are programs to coordinate care amongst individuals, programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, programs to tackle the special needs of mental health, programs for health promotion and early intervention, measures to control the rising cost of technology, initiatives on rural health and, backing all and underpinning this, a commitment to biomedical research. The government has an extraordinarily strong record of achievement in every single one of these eight areas. In the program of coordinated care, we commenced in 1998 coordinated care trials that have been described by Professor Chris Silagy as the largest experiment in public health in the world. Twelve major trials have run around Australia - including four in Aboriginal communities - that are changing the way we deliver health care in Australia in giving people better care for long-term illness. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, our funding has gone up 51 per cent in direct funding - and 70 per cent, if you count indirect funding - and is projected to go up to $220 million by the year 2003-2004. We have frame care agreements in place with every state and territory, an army-ATSIC infra-struc-ture program, and special programs on sexually transmitted disease, immunisa-tion and mental health, amongst others. Looking at the special needs of mental health, we have the National Depression Initiative, the National Suicide Prevention Initiative and the second National Mental Health Strategy, which was funded in the 1997 budget.In health promotion, we have been particularly successful. In immunisation, we have taken Australia's immunisation rate from 68th in the world to one that is now quite acceptable internationally with a figure of nearly 90 per cent of completed childhood immunisations in kids 12 to 15 months of age. In controlling the rising costs of technology, we have very successfully introduced therapeutic group premiums and have a Medical Services Advisory Committee to bring new things onto the Medicare benefits schedule. In consumer information, Health in Sight is up and running as a major mega-hub. In rural health, the number of doctors has increased in rural Australia. We have a Wagga clinical school and university departments of rural health in every state and, earlier today, I launched with the member for Gilmore a new expansion of the clinical school in Canberra, with 25 places funded out of the federal budget for rural doctors. That means Canberra will inevitably go towards its own medical school. This will enable Canberra to have outreach into the south coast of New South Wales and the electorates of Eden-Monaro and Gilmore. Those two members should be very proud, because they have been pushing for this very hard for a number of years. In biomedical research, we have doubled the amount of commitment to Commonwealth funding.The reason I mention these areas is that even the Labor Party recognises that these are areas that need to be strengthened. In a press release on 22 July 1999, the health spokesman Ms Macklin said that the ALP was about to enter an intensive phase of health policy development in the lead-up to the ALP's national convention. Ms Macklin said she had some specific areas where she wanted to have policies to strengthen Medicare in time for the national convention. I wonder whether honourable members want to guess how she went on her own measure: policies to develop publicly funded coordinated care programs - nothing about those whatsoever; policies to overcome major inequities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health - nothing whatsoever; programs to tackle the special needs of mental health - nothing whatsoever; a focus on health promotion and early intervention - nothing whatsoever; to control the rising costs of medicine by ensuring that technology is used appropriately - nothing whatsoever; to have greater access to information for consumers - nothing whatsoever. There are six areas where she marked herself a measurement, with a fail on every one and not even a bare attempt to address the most basic of policy issues.The fact is that, when it comes to Medicare, Labor has basked in smug complacency. Labor's Medicare left Australian children dying of measles; Labor's Medicare sold out rural Australia; Labor's Medicare had 36 Aboriginal communities without any access to health care services whatsoever and with no plans for access to health care whatsoever. Labor in government showed that it was incapable of having the intellectual clout to make policies in this area and, by its own measure in opposition, it has not even begun. </DOC>

 - Let me say that the McClure report is really posited on five key areas of reform. The first of those is that service delivery should be more tailored to individual needs. The second is that there should be a simpler and more flexible benefits structure. The third is that there should be better incentives and more assistance for participation. The fourth is that there should be better recognition of the principle of mutual obligation throughout the income support system for working age people. Finally, there is a need for better social partnerships to strengthen communities and provide more opportunities for participation.The government will examine this report very carefully. I am encouraged that, unlike in some of the earlier questions, the Leader of the Opposition actually used some words that were a little welcoming of McClure. Let me say that is good, because it may mean that on this issue the Labor Party will not do what it did in relation to taxation reform. -  - Well, it is your political future that is involved in this. What you have to understand is that, in relation to tax reform, you forecast social Armageddon - and it did not happen. You said that the world was going to come to an end on 1 July. And in relation to welfare reform, which is the basis of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I would counsel the Australian Labor Party not to go down the path of negativity.You see, within the Australian community, people believe in a couple of things about welfare. They believe that we should have a decent social security safety net. That is now a bipartisan `given' in Australian politics. Even people like Michael Raper of ACOSS, who in the past have been critical of the coalition when we were in opposition, now recognise that it is no longer an issue of dispute and that there is bipartisan support in this country for delivering a proper social security safety net. Nobody is going to take away needed sustenance from deserving Australians. This government is not going to do it, and I do not believe that any decent aspiring political leader in this country is going to do it.So the debate now moves onto a different plane, and that is how best to deliver an effective forward-looking modern welfare system, just as the debate in relation to tax should have been how you deliver a forward-looking modern taxation system. We took up the challenge with taxation and we faced obstruction, sabotage and negativity from the Australian Labor Party at every point along the path. Against the fierce and tenacious opposition of the Australian Labor Party, we have now achieved taxation reform. We are now turning our attention to welfare reform.Let me make it very clear to the Labor Party that you can run a fear campaign. Having repulsed your fear campaign on tax, you need not think a fear campaign on welfare is going to frighten us one bit. I can assure those who sit opposite that, if you really want to be a serious participant in this debate, instead of adopting a negative, carping, snide, obstructive attitude, as you did in relation to tax reform, you will adopt a constructive attitude in relation to welfare reform.I believe that McClure's report - and I want to thank Patrick McClure and the members of the committee for the report - provides the platform, the foundation for a very positive and constructive debate about the future of Australia's welfare system. I welcome thus far a number of the remarks that have been made on behalf of ACOSS by Mr Raper. He has generally expressed some positive views about the report. Obviously, he and the welfare community will have views they will put to the government very strongly. But we enter this debate in good will. We enter this debate determined to protect the vulnerable in the Australian community. We enter this debate determined to give to the unemployed of this country the greatest gift any government could give them, and that is the opportunity of a job. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: throw away the negativity that failed with tax and join us in a constructive debate to give this country a better welfare system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for raising this issue and providing me with an opportunity to say something in the House today. On 1 July this year, the government introduced a Fuel Sales Grants Scheme that will be available to all retailers of petrol and diesel in non-metropolitan and remote areas. That is one cent a litre for sales of petrol and diesel to consumers in non-metropolitan areas and two cents per litre for sales in remote areas. So that grant helps to address, but of course not remove, the price differential between cities and the country.At this point, I remind the House that the ACCC is supervising the implementation of this scheme. The fuel scheme holds the fuel retailer accountable for passing on the full grant to consumers. The grant was prescribed under the price exploitation legislation, and any failure to pass the full benefit of the grant to final consumers can result in fines of up to $10 million. At the same time, the ACCC is monitoring petrol prices at 4,000 sites around Australia, including 1,400 sites in country Australia covering about 70 per cent of the rural population. I take this opportunity to remind the House that there was an announcement in this House yesterday, as the member for Page asked, about policy from the Labor Party. - It gave us a little taste of what roll-back really means. - I take this opportunity to remind the House of what the member for Hunter said on -  - I would like to remind the House -  - This answer must be cutting deep; you don't want to hear it. - I will just remind the House what the member for Hunter said on radio station 2NM on 24 July. He said:My pledge to my party - `my party', that is, the Labor Party - is this: that petrol prices have been an issue for decades. At every election they become an election issue, but after the election the problem remains no matter who wins.He went on to say:I say that if we want to be serious about petrol issues in the bush in particular, we need to take a policy direction that I argue will fix it, or at the very least certainly improve the situation.Yesterday in the House during the MPI - in fact, the Leader of the Opposition was at the table at the time - I challenged the member for Hunter to explain what the Labor Party would do on fuel prices. He said:Firstly, by taking the exact opposite approach to that taken by those who sit opposite. The approach by those who sit opposite is to take $500 million of taxpayers' money and hand it to the major oil companies. The $500 million fuel grants scheme largely goes straight to the major oil companies because they largely run, whether directly or by commission agency, the service stations in this country. There we had the member for Hunter giving us a taste of what roll-back really means. It means ripping $500 million out of subsidies for people in the bush. The Leader of the Opposition has set new ground because he normally sacks people for telling the truth, but on this occasion the member for Hunter is still sitting on the front bench. I will tell you what roll-back means in this situation, Mr Speaker -  - I inform the member for Paterson that under the Labor Party's new policy petrol in Bulahdelah is going to go up 1c a litre, and it is going to be directly due to the Labor Party. Petrol in Nguiu, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory is going to go up 2c a litre; and petrol in Middlemount in Capricornia is going to go up 2c a litre. It is going to go up 1c a litre under the Labor Party's roll-back in Bass. It is going to go up 1c a litre in Macedon in Burke. It is going to go up 1c a litre in Muswellbrook in the member for Hunter's seat. That is what roll-back means. It means more expensive fuel in the bush. It means the Labor Party cutting $500 million - </DOC>

 - We are in danger of an outburst of cooperation on this issue. I welcome the Leader of the Opposition welcoming something I have said. I also welcome the fact, and no doubt the Leader of the Opposition will welcome the fact, that Mr Raper has said that this is a very positive framework set forward in this report. It gives real direction for the government to actually build that bridge so that long-term unemployed people, people with disabilities and parents of work force age can get across that river into the world of employment. - The Leader of the Opposition is trying to be cooperative, and you are being off cue, Cheryl. - The Leader of the Opposition asked me for an explicit guarantee. Can I say, with the greatest of goodwill, we got the report this morning, we endorse its general thrust, and we are going to give a detailed response when we have had a look at it.Opposition member - When? - That is the sort of idiotic interjection that destroys any kind of possibility of a constructive bipartisan approach on a very important matter of public policy. Social welfare reform deserves more than that kind of on-the-run interjection. Social welfare reform deserves a bit of mature response from both sides of politics. We intend to give it, and we are going to give it. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to do the same. I am encouraged by the fact that he is taking a constructive approach. He appears to have listened to John Della Bosca. I welcome that fact because, at the end of the day, the vulnerable in the Australian community will benefit from a bit of maturity from the government and the opposition on this very sensitive issue. That is the attitude we are going to take. We are going to examine the report. We think McClure has done a first-class job. We endorse the general thrust, and if the thing can be processed in an intelligent fashion on the basis of the principles laid down in the report, I think that would be a very good thing for the country, the underprivileged and the vulnerable. That is the goodwill, the heart and the decency that this government is going to bring to the report. </DOC>

In the electorate of McEwen there are two significant Defence establishments. One is the Graytown ammunition facility and the other is the Puckapunyal base. Last night the member for Bendigo, in typical Labor Party fashion, got out there and started a smear campaign in which he claimed the government was proposing to shut down the Graytown operation. That is not true. The government's position is well known.

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. He is well aware that I have come to the preliminary view that the proposed Western Australian alternative right to negotiate native title provisions comply with the Commonwealth Native Title Act. In fact I intend to consult with Aboriginal representative bodies on the subject in Broome next week. If the determinations are finally made, they will then be tabled in parliament and open to disallowance. - Members will be aware that the Senate currently has before it a series of determinations relating to Queensland's proposed alternative native title regime. These relate to mining exploration permits, claims and leases. However, the Democrats have moved a motion of disallowance, which is due to be debated by 30 August. It is the case, I regret to say, that the federal Labor Party have still not indicated whether they will support their Queensland colleagues and allow the legislation to pass through parliament. Premier Beattie has been pleading for months for federal Labor to deliver certainty to the people of Queensland. Caucus had the opportunity yesterday to reach a position on this issue, but we have heard nothing. Maybe it will go to the national executive.  I was asked about alternative policies. I expect that Labor will continue to leave this question unanswered. They will leave it open to conjecture whether they will reopen a divisive debate on native title by rejecting Queensland's provisions in the same way that they rejected the Northern Territory's. So where do we look for their native title policy? You might suggest the ALP platform debated in Hobart. I am afraid the answers are not there; there are only questions. The ALP platform says that the 1998 amendments are `unjust, unworkable and open to legal challenge'. But what does the platform say they are going to do about it? The platform vaguely commits Labor to refinement of the legislation in the future, but it does not spell out how this is going to be done. It leaves open still the question of whether Labor are going to repeal the amendments. Of course there is a minority report of the parliamentary joint committee on native title recently delivered which may provide some answers. The majority of that committee found that the 1998 amendments were consistent with Australia's international obligations and are not discriminatory and represented a fair balance between all stakeholders. But the minority report, endorsed by Labor members, condemns the 1998 amendments as racially discriminatory. The minority appear to be proposing a whole raft of provisions to be added to the Native Title Act. The minority report also introduces a completely new concept of traditional title, which sits over and above native title, which is incapable of extinguishment. Is this Labor policy? Time is ticking away. Queensland native title claimants and resource developers need to know what Labor is going to do. But it looks like Labor is going to run to the death knell. With only two weeks to go, when is Labor going to get its act together? </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is certainly well aware of the problems confronting the sugar industry in Queensland. Those concerns have been raised frequently by the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Leichhardt and the other sugar seat representatives - none of whom, I might add, are on the opposite side of the House. We have not heard one word, actually, from people opposite in relation to the concerns of the sugar industry. In fact, the Labor Party federal conference has just been held in Hobart. Since this is such a significant issue for agriculture, one would have expected that the Labor Party might well have announced what they would do in relation to aid to the sugar industry. But they sat there silently while the free traders rolled the fair traders and no offer of support was forthcoming. - I can also confirm in response to the interjection - or repeat of the question - that the industry has put to the federal government and to the Queensland state Labor government a detailed package seeking significant amounts of funds to support the industry in the planting of cane for next season. The amounts of money were of the order of magnitude suggested by the honourable member for Dawson.The federal government has been endeavouring to have the Queensland government respond to that package over a long period of time, but the state government has of course been unwilling to discuss these sorts of issues. Finally, last week, without any consultation with the federal government, the Queensland government announced that, in response to this request for loan funds in the order of $580 million, they would transfer money from some of their existing farm programs to a loan scheme for Queensland sugar producers to a total value of $10 million. So Labor's response to a significant issue of this nature has been to transfer funds from one program to another to a total value of $10 million. The actual cost to the Queensland government of that action will be about $1 million. - The federal government is concerned about the issues that have been raised by honourable members. We will address them appropriately and make an announcement in time for the industry to respond to the need to plant this season's crop.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for the question. I am sure the honourable member for Deakin was prompted to ask this question when reading a press release from the shadow Attorney and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs where this quote can be seen. It relates to the issue of a tribunal to deal with what are called `reparations issues' in relation to separated children, and says:While it is possible that there would be some initial administrative challenges arising from the findings of such a body, experience shows that, once the parameters of the system are established, such further administrative challenges would be rare.That is what we were told by Gerry Hand when the Refugee Review Tribunal was set up - and the Migration Review Tribunal. At the time when the Refugee Review Tribunal was set up, in the year 1993-94, 52 matters were the subject of judicial review, notwithstanding a decision by the tribunal.This year - 1999-2000 - 684 cases have been taken before the courts at first instance for judicial review, and that does not include the further matters that have gone to the full Federal Court. It does not include the matters that have gone to the High Court. It does not include the running costs of the courts themselves. And the costs of litigation to my department in the last financial year have been $13 million. When we look then at the costs of running the tribunal - the tribunal that was meant to save us the cost of litigation - we find that in the year 1993-94 it cost $11.8 million. In this year's budget papers it is estimated to be $16.7 million. So it is certainly flawed to suggest that tribunals on their own would substantially reduce costs. If the Labor Party is serious about the issue of costs, the issue of costs can be addressed. It can be addressed by a privative clause which boosts the validity of the tribunal. That is how it can be addressed. And we have got legislation in another place to do just that.  - Where is the Labor Party when it comes to putting that reform in place? They are opposed to it. -  - Justice, he says. I ask the Labor Party: are you serious about containing the cost of litigation in relation to separated children? Are you serious about containing that cost by setting up a tribunal? How would you contain it? Would you use a privative clause? Are you saying - if you would use a privative clause to be able to contain that expenditure - that you would have one view in relation to indigenous peoples' claims and another for people who have come to Australia unlawfully in allowing them to access our courts? Is that the sort of approach that you would take?</DOC>

 - No. I would like to add that the government is certainly not concerned with some internal Telstra musings about the Besley inquiry. I have looked at this red-hot, top-secret, protected eyes only inquiry. It is from the head of the regulatory section. It is thinking aloud; it is reading the tea-leaves on the Besley inquiry. You might as well open up a chicken and study the entrails for as much knowledge as this might provide. What is more interesting is the transcript of the doorstop that the honourable member gave today. He was caught out, bowled out by a journalist who asked:What is in the memo specifically that leads you to draw the conclusion that the government has somehow tainted the inquiry? It is an easy question. You would expect a simple reference to the memo to find the words that allowed the member to make these outrageous claims that he has repeated just now. His answer:Well, firstly, it's a secret memo.That is really answering the question of what words in the memo led him to draw the conclusion that the inquiry was tainted, Mr Smith continued:Secondly, it's been leaked ...So, ipso facto, the inquiry has been tainted. It is just ridiculous. The journalist is not happy with that. There are some measly, mealy-mouthed words to add to that. The journalist asks:But what's in the memo that leads you to draw that conclusion? What are the words in the memo?The journalist repeats the question. The answer: what is clear from reports today and reports circulating in Telstra is that the Besley inquiry is fundamentally flawed and tainted. In other words, he just asserts that; he repeats the assertion. I have the same question: where are the words in the memo that would draw you to make the claims that you have repeated in your question? What is more interesting is: where are the Leader of the Opposition's words to deny that he raised privatisation with Mr Blount when he recruited him as the chief executive officer of Telstra?  - No. Blount has not agreed. - Mr Speaker, Mr Blount said on radio 5AM on 20 October last year:I was told by some individuals within the government that they thought it should be privatised, but Kim Beazley's name has never been mentioned by me.Now that is not the same as saying that Beazley was not one of those people. What I am interested in is not whether or not Mr Beazley as minister for communication was in favour of privatisation but whether or not he raised with Mr Blount the government's views of the day - Labor Party views of the privatisation of Telstra. You have the chance at any stage in parliamentary life to stand up and tell us that you did not raise with Mr Blount the government's point of view. - The hypocrisy on this issue is breathtaking. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the `Simply Simon' legendary interview of earlier this week goes off the record when he talks about Telstra and GST to express his personal views. - Mr Speaker, I was asked about issues relating to the privatisation of Telstra. I have already said that the government places no importance on this supposedly top-secret memo, which is the internal ramblings of one person. What is of even greater concern in this doorstop is that the shadow minister says, in addition to trying to make out a case that even the journalist caught him out on:We have known that since the partial privatisation of Telstra service levels to country Australia, service levels to the bush, have fallen. That is a blatant, calculated untruth, as measured by the Australian Communications Authority. A press release by the shadow minister last December congratulated Telstra on its improved levels of service to country people under the government's introduced customer service guarantee. This is just Labor Party hypocrisy at its very worst.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know that members of the House will recall last week's outstanding ABS labour force figures, which showed that Australia's overall unemployment rate had fallen to a 10-year low of 6.3 per cent. Within that overall figure, it showed that the unemployment rate in New South Wales of 5.4 per cent was at its lowest level since October of 1981. Today the ABS published a further breakdown of unemployment rates by statistical region. These figures show that the areas of Australia with the lowest unemployment rates include parts of Sydney at around 2½ per cent, the Darling Downs at 3.6 per cent, southern Melbourne at 3.6 per cent and the Northern Territory at 4.8 per cent. Of course the government recognises that there are still regions around Australia where the level of unemployment is unacceptably high such as the Richmond-Tweed at 10.3 per cent, northern Adelaide at 9.2 per cent, the Mersey-Lyell in Tasmania at nine per cent.  For a moment I will focus on an area which is represented in this parliament in part by my ministerial colleague the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who is the federal member for Lindsay, and as well represented in this parliament by a number of members of the Australian Labor Party, that is, the western suburbs of Sydney - an area of Australia that in the past has seemingly had intractably high rates of unemployment. For example, in late 1982, the unemployment rate in the Fairfield, Liverpool and the outer south-western region of Sydney was no less than 18.6 per cent. In early 1993, the unemployment rate in the central western Sydney region peaked at 20.8 per cent, while the outer Western Sydney and Blacktown region experienced unemployment well over 12 per cent. They were regarded as archetypal areas of intractably high levels of unemployment. I am delighted to inform the House that this situation over the last 4½ years has changed quite dramatically. According to the ABS figures released this morning, unemployment rates in those regions for July 2000 are as follows: in Fairfield, Liverpool and the outer south-west, the figure is 6.2 per cent - in other words, an area which under Labor was 18.6 per cent. In the heartland of what used to be the area that Labor claimed politically as its own the unemployment rate was three times what it is now. I think it is an incredibly proud boast of this government that we have been able to reduce unemployment to the national average in areas of Western Sydney historically regarded as having intractably high levels of unemployment. In central Western Sydney, the figure is 3.3 per cent. In outer Western Sydney and Blacktown, the figure is 4.8 per cent, against a national average of 6.3 per cent. This is perhaps symbolised by a small story in today's Daily Telegraph under the heading `Business couldn't be better'. It records:Business has been so good that Yassin Alhaify decided to take the plunge last month and start his own company. The Liverpool painter said last night he had no problem finding work since moving to Sydney's west six years ago.And since starting his own business Mr Alhaify has already put on two staff. 'I think it's easy to find a job in Sydney,' he said. Mr Alhaify said he was taking his new business 'step-by-step' but already had plans to get his builder's licence and expand. That is the message of hope, opportunity and enthusiasm in the western suburbs of Sydney under the coalition government. It is a great story and it is great news for the people of Western Sydney.</DOC>

 - I think the simple response to that is to say that the government are quite capable of putting in place - and have in place - a USO. We are quite capable of making it work. What is more, we have put in place a customer service guarantee. We put it in place; you never did. The appalling hypocrisy of the ALP on this -   - whose performance in government in relation to telecommunications in rural and regional Australia gives the clear lie to their feigned and new found interest in this matter, ought to be recalled. - The member for Paterson touts himself as a representative of rural and regional Australia in this place. His mob are the people who phased out analog phones, which we had to find a replacement for. He gets up here and spouts about fuel: their new found interest in matters rural and regional. We did a bit of simple maths the other day which established that, if they had remained in office, fuel excise under them would now be well over 50c a litre on the annualised basis that they put in place while they were in power. All I can say to this is that their record in office was appalling. There was no commitment to an effective USO. There was simply no CSG under them. Governments are quite capable of insisting on decent standards in rural and regional Australia. That is the commitment that we make - pure and simple.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I think I can say that the acceptance of the new tax system is growing and that its introduction in Australia has been much better than was widely anticipated. The Australian newspaper today reports:`GST support soaring'Public sentiment has shifted sharply towards the GST in its first six weeks ...I think all members of the House will welcome that, including those members of the Labor Party who now support the new taxation system. The number of people who think the reforms will be good for Australia outnumber the number who think they will not be good for Australia by a record of two to one: 50 per cent of Australians think that the tax reform is good for Australia and only 23 per cent think that it is bad. That comes on the back of a sharp lift in consumer sentiment - from the Westpac Melbourne index - and that indicates growing consumer satisfaction with the new taxation system. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, as he is wont to do, a constant barrage of noise, but the only noise we never hear from him is noise about roll-back. You will recall that he first of all said that the new tax system would be a `nightmare'. That is what he said. Down in Launceston, on 1 July, he said, `They face an absolute nightmare.' That is what he said on 1 July. On 21 February he said that there was a `dark cloud' hanging over Australia - a cloud that would become a `deluge'. Then, when the cloud did not become a deluge and when the nightmare did not materialise, it became a `slow burn' - we were going to have a slow burn then. First of all we were going to have a flood and then we were going to have a slow burn, according to the Leader of the Opposition. As time goes by in fact public acceptance increases.We have been waiting to hear all about roll-back all week. We are still waiting to hear about roll-back. Obviously there is some confusion in the Labor Party ranks about the roll-back policy because I have come across a letter which is being mailed out in South Australia by Senator Rosemary Crowley:Dear resident,On 1st July, the Howard Government's GST started. Last year I chaired an inquiry into the GST and I know how unfair the GST is ...Kim Beazley has promised if elected a Labor government will roll back the GST to make it fairer for all Australians. But we need you to tell us what needs to be changed.We will go down Rundle Mall and we will find somebody who will tell us what roll-back means. We will go out onto the street and we will find somebody who will tell us how to put together a tax policy. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may not know this, but you are actually the person who announced the roll-back policy, not the people on the streets of Adelaide. And then Labor Senator Rosemary Crowley engages in the largest part of push polling I have ever seen in my life - absolutely disgusting push polling! She goes out with about 10 questions which are not designed to elicit roll-back at all, but which are designed to try to pull up what the Labor Party cannot do; namely, it cannot produce any consumer sentiment which is running against the GST - in fact, the opposite. So the Labor Party is now into push polling. I table Senator Crowley's letter trying to find out from the people of Adelaide a policy for the Labor Party. It reminds me of when the Leader of the Opposition went on the Jon Faine program. He was asked on the Jon Faine program how he was going to increase spending, roll back the GST and do all these things. He made the famous statement:Jon, I'll tell you what to do. You write your ideas down on a piece of paper and send them to me in Canberra.`And send them to me in Canberra'! We are a week into the new taxation system. I am still waiting for a question on the GST from the shadow Treasurer after the first week of implementation. The public is still waiting for detail on roll-back, and the best that the Labor Party can come up with is grabbing people off the streets of Adelaide. People off the streets of Adelaide would have a better idea of roll-back than you, and they are likely to be much more economically literate too.</DOC>

 - Can I say that I would imagine that everybody in the parliament - including in particular the honourable member for Farrer, who is the honorary mayor of the Paralympic village, and the honourable member for Cowan, who is one of the managers of the Paralympic team, and every other member of the House - will want the Paralympic Games to be a great success. They will take place between 18 and 29 October, and there will be more than 4,000 athletes from at least 120 countries competing. Australia's Paralympic team from Atlanta was one of the most successful sporting teams ever. The Australian team for the Sydney 2000 Paralympics was announced by the Treasurer in Sydney on 27 July. There will be more than 300 athletes in the Australian team, which will be our largest ever Paralympic team. Of course we wish them and all other competitors well in the games when they begin. There has been considerable support financially, to the tune of $35 million, to the Sydney Paralympic organising committee. More than $6.2 million has been provided over the last four years for preparation of the Australian athletes. In addition, the government is providing $550,000 to the Australian Paralympic committee to cover the cost of the entry fees for the Australian team. And we have provided more than $500,000 to extend the Paralympic torch relay to all state and territory capital cities.We have made available a subsidy to help schoolchildren living more than 200 kilometres from Sydney to travel to the Paralympics with their schools. The subsidy will assist more than 30,000 schoolchildren to attend the games, at a total cost for the subsidy of more than $700,000. The participation of thousands of schoolchildren will be a special characteristic of the games.In a very bipartisan way - and I know that what the government have done in this area has had the full support of the opposition - we have been anxious to do what we could to ensure that not only were the games the best Paralympic Games yet but also that there was a very representative, competitive and, I believe, outstanding Australian team to compete. I know that many members of the House will attend many of the events of the Paralympic Games. I know that the Paralympic Games will be an outstanding success. We in this House wish all of the members of the Australian team the very best of good fortune in this very important sporting contest in their lives.</DOC>

 - The claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that we cut $850 million out of child-care spending by Labor is wrong - it is simply wrong. The truth is that total expenditure on child care over the last four years was more than $4 billion. That is 30 per cent more - I repeat, 30 per cent more - than was expended during the last four years when Labor was in government. I do not know how many times figures like this have to be repeated. The Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both ways. He cannot pretend to the world on one day that he is interested in a constructive approach to welfare reform and then be back up here today, when he notices that maybe the reception given to the report was a little better than he had hoped, with a little sleazy argument about reductions in expenditure. Let me go on. We have committed $5.3 billion over the next four years, and this includes $600 million of additional funding for child care over three years for the introduction of the new child-care benefit. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to the dental program. This was a program with a limited life to address a specific need. I say `a limited life' because they were the words that were used by the Keating government. It was in fact introduced in the early 1990s by the Keating government to address a specific need in an area that was traditionally the role of the states. It was made very clear by the Keating government, when the program was introduced, that it was not necessarily going to go on forever - that once the need had been met then obviously the Commonwealth would withdraw.There is a much bigger dimension to this. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question, because it enables me to point out to the House and to the Australian people that the biggest single intervention by any government to underpin welfare spending in this country in the last 50 years has been the introduction of the GST. Those people who voted against the goods and services tax - and that includes every member of the Australian Labor Party - were voting against a decent social welfare safety net for the states, because the provision of many of these social services is the responsibility of the states. One of the great benefits of tax reform is that, as the years go by, every state in Australia - starting with Queensland - in no longer period of time than two years, will have more money to spend on government schools, more money to spend on government hospitals, more money to spend on roads and more money to spend on police services. Every state in Australia will be better endowed to provide those basic services. All of that is courtesy of the leadership of the coalition. All of those things were opposed by the Labor Party, and therefore the last party in this parliament that can claim to have the welfare of the vulnerable closest to its heart is the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in this matter. I am very pleased to be able to tell honourable members that the legislation to fully phase out tobacco advertising in Australia is well on the way to being passed and is before the other place. When this goes through, Australia will be the first country outside Europe to have comprehensively sought to phase out tobacco advertising. In fact if the European parliament's decision to ban tobacco advertising is overturned in the courts, which is widely expected, we will be among the first in the world to take such action. - This has built on four years of strong activity, with a national tobacco campaign that began in June 1997; a change to per-stick taxation of tobacco - something that the medical profession and antitobacco lobby have wanted for 20 years; a substantial increase in tobacco excise; and a national tobacco strategy that was adopted by all state and territory governments last year at the health ministers conference. This strategy is beginning to show real results, particularly in the honourable member for Boothby's state - I have to say South Australia is leading the country in this area.The national tobacco campaign, in particular, has received great accolades. Just last week in Chicago at the World Conference on Smoking and Health it was held up as an outstanding example of antitobacco advertising. It has been picked up by Poland, Singapore and New Zealand and by the states of British Columbia, Massachusetts and California. It is regarded as world best practice for any antismoking effort. Of course one of the results one has to look at is whether it is having an effect on the Australian public. If one uses figures from the National Drug Household Survey, between 1993 and 1996 the rate of tobacco smoking in Australia was static. It dropped only from 24.8 per cent to 24.6 per cent. Over the period 1996 to 1998, we have seen a drop from 24.6 per cent to 22 per cent - something that gives us enormous encouragement. I should also say that one of the greatest forms of flattery is mimicry. These successes have been accompanied by quite outrageous and inaccurate statements by the Labor Party - the shadow minister for health suggesting that Labor initiated the campaign that is getting so much success around the world and that they in fact put in considerably more than this government. I am happy to look at both of those in order - first, Labor's campaign that they say led to this campaign. When I became minister in 1996, I was begged by virtually every single antitobacco body in the country to bury the campaign that had been started by the Labor Party. The results are easy to see, and I read from the evaluation of that campaign.Negative findings to emerge were: less acceptance amongst regular and heavy smokers that smoking is a boring activity; a tendency for regular smokers in particular to become annoyed and irritated at repeated screenings; the approach only slightly challenged existing values and beliefs; the main barriers to the communication were the length and boringness of the situations, particularly of repeating screenings and lack of relevance and underlying concept; and there has been very little change in attitude amongst the target group between benchmark and tracking surveys.That was the campaign that Labor are claiming so much success for and that every antitobacco group I spoke to in the country asked me to ditch in 1996.The shadow minister for health also talks about funding and claims that the Labor Party spent more than the government has. I asked my department to pull out these figures. In fact, between 1993 and 1996, the Labor Party spent only $6.3 million on tobacco control activities. What the shadow minister for health is doing is taking numbers out of the budget as to what Labor promised to do and not looking at what they actually did. With the Labor Party, you have to make a distinction between what they promise to do and what they end up doing. In the three years of the national tobacco campaign, from mid-1997 to now, the government has spent $14.2 million on tobacco control activities. If you wish to compare the last three years of this government with the last three years of Labor, the increase in money spent on tobacco cessation activities is up 226 per cent. It is even more stark if you want to look at the media buy, because a very high proportion of that $6.3 million of Labor's money went into production activities. As best we can estimate, the media buy over those three years was only of the order of $2 million; the media buy over the last three years from the federal government has been $10 million. So it is five to one, if you wish to compare comparable periods. I am delighted the shadow minister for health has promised that Labor will come up with a tobacco policy in the lead-up to the next election. She might actually try to use accurate facts, though, and I hope she makes a better fist of it than of all the things she promised to do in July last year at the nurses conference.</DOC>

 - The minister indicated yesterday, and I would repeat it today, that we are going to have a look at all of the recommendations in the report, and we are going to give a whole-of-government response. I heard what the minister had to say this morning, and she quite properly drew attention - and I listened very carefully to what she had to say - to the circumstances of the Australian welfare system compared with the welfare system that obtains in, say, the United States. In fact, I would have thought that the Labor Party would want to preserve those features of the Australian welfare system that are different from those in the United States. I have always thought -  Opposition members - Rubbish! - Rubbish? That is interesting. I had always thought that the Australian welfare system was more open and generous hearted than the American welfare system. One of the things I have said on numerous occasions - over the years and in many of the positions I have held - is that I have never been an advocate of the American approach to welfare. I think the American approach to welfare, in some crucial aspects, is less caring than the Australian approach. I think Australia, by and large, over the years, no matter who has been in office - and the Leader of the Opposition is asking that people put their prejudices aside - on both sides of politics, has been able to strike a better balance in social welfare than have the United States or most of the nations of Europe. That is one of the reasons why we have avoided some of what I regard as the excesses of the American system that have made a contribution to an unacceptably high jail population. Yet, in contrast to the European system, we have not gone down the path of so much intervention as to produce an unacceptably high public sector as now obtains in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany.I think that, by and large in this country, we have got it right. We have got a good balance, though that is not to say it is perfect. I think that both sides of Australian politics have made a contribution to getting that balance. I would have thought that McClure was an opportunity to move on in an Australian way to build an even better welfare system. I welcome the constructive contributions to the debate that come from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley. I know that on occasions they fall back into negativity, but I encourage them to put aside that temptation and I encourage them to join the government and join ACOSS and join Patrick McClure and join all other men and women of goodwill in the Australian community in order to build, in the Australian way, a stronger and better welfare system.</DOC>

 - I would certainly like to thank the member for Pearce, who I know has a very keen interest in welfare reform, as do the members of the coalition and many members of the opposition. I am very glad to see that the McClure report has been well endorsed by the community, by business, by the Democrats and even by members of the opposition. It is interesting to note that ACOSS president, Michael Raper, said the report's recommendations `could lead people to better incomes, and to new employment opportunities'. He also described what the report provides as a `promising framework'. The Council on the Ageing welcomed the report's recommendation, saying that it `could help older unemployed' people. The Women's Electoral Lobby said, `This report offers some welcome ideas and suggestions for welfare reform.' Even the Leader of the Australian Democrats has described it as `a balanced package'. I note that the Leader of the Opposition agrees that there are some good ideas in this report, and we welcome that. Perhaps I am not quite as generous as the Prime Minister, but I think the member for Lilley at times gets confused about welfare reform. Maybe that is because the member for Lilley and some other members of the opposition are not as committed as we would like to see them. There is their confusion over their commitment to tax reform. One minute they are opposed to it and then they are going to back it. It is interesting that on 28 September last year, the member for Lilley said the welfare process had been `completely discredited'. - On 29 September last year, he described the independent welfare reference group who produced this report as a `razor gang'. But yesterday he endorsed the recommendations, and we are very pleased. On the one hand, the member for Lilley is supporting welfare reform but, on the other hand, regrettably he is still resorting to scaremongering and fear with some of the most vulnerable in the community: pensioners, older Australians, families, sole parents - and many sole parents do a terrific job of bringing up their children, of course - and people with disabilities. Despite our reassurances that we will not be reducing any benefits, you continue with this propaganda. I suppose the bottom line is that in many ways you have been caught rewriting history for your own failed policies in the 13 years of stewardship of the Australian Labor Party. Let us look at some of these figures. Let us look at the unemployment queues. When the coalition came into government, we inherited 11.2 per cent unemployment from the halcyon days when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training. That figure is now down to 6.3 per cent. We have created 800,000 new jobs, and of course 174,000 people who were on the Newstart or youth allowance are no longer there because they are in employment. Your Working Nation absolutely failed. We found that 30 per cent of the people on Work for the Dole, which was never meant to give people false expectations of a job, actually get employment. Even the Leader of the Opposition knows the bottom line is you have no alternatives, only vague statements and imaginary policies. We would welcome your commitment. The coalition are serious about welfare reform. We hope you are serious about welfare reform and do not attempt to walk both sides of the street.</DOC>

 - I have no idea what John Laws or indeed any other commentator has in their mind when they make statements. I am most interested in what the Australian people have in their minds because, in the end, I am accountable not to the media but to the Australian people. I will always be very happy to take my ultimate riding instructions from the Australian people. In relation to the issue of petrol, the facts are very clear. The price of petrol has fluctuated an enormous amount. The principal driving force behind the fluctuation in the price of petrol over the last 12 months has not been tax changes; it has been changes in the world price of crude oil.It is about time that some perspective was put back in this debate in relation to the remarks being made by the opposition, the remarks being made by some people in the media and the remarks being made by the automobile and motoring organisations, which have the luxury of playing to understandable public unhappiness with the rising price of fuel. Basically, what the opposition and the motoring organisations of Australia are saying is, `We don't like the fact that the price of petrol is going up a bit' - we understand that; we do not like it either - `and really the government ought to do something about it.' The only way the government -  - If you have a situation where the price of petrol is rising largely due to the influence of the world price of crude oil, you can do one of two things. You can abandon the policy of import parity pricing, which would have disastrous consequences for the long-term availability of fuel in this country and is not a policy that I understand is advocated by the Australian Labor Party, or you can embrace a discretionary reduction in the amount of excise charged by the government. We are not going to change world parity pricing because that would be a very unwise and imprudent policy. In relation to a discretionary reduction in the level of excise, I do not hear the Labor Party advocating by how much it ought to be cut. I do not hear the Labor Party advocating where the money ought to come from. I hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who asked the question, promising the Australian people that he is going to have a bigger surplus than we now have, and yet he is asking this question. There comes a time with these opportunistic questions when people have to face the consequences of what they are advocating. If you want to reduce the price of petrol, either you must abandon world parity pricing and have the honesty to say where the money is coming from or you must advocate a discretionary reduction in the price of excise. You can shout, rant and rave as much as you want in the opposition but, until you have the intellectual honesty -  - No, I have not completed my answer. - It is about time that the opposition were made to face the reality of what they are advocating. They are trying to take political advantage of the fact that the price of petrol in this country is higher than the consumer would want. There are effectively two avenues available to government to do something about that. One of them is a radical change in policy that would make no sense, and that is to abandon import parity pricing. The other is to have a discretionary cut in the level of excise. If you advocate a discretionary cut in the level of excise, you have to have the courage to say by how much and where the money is coming from. You ought not to have the intellectual stupidity at the same time to advocate that you are going to have an even higher surplus than the coalition now have. The time for cheap opportunism on this issue of petrol pricing is over. If the opposition want a change, if they want cheaper petrol for the Australian community, it is about time they had the courage to tell the Australian people how they think that goal ought to be achieved.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. The Cook portrait unveiled by the Prime Minister yesterday is an acquisition of immense importance to the National Portrait Gallery and the nation. The work is of enormous value both as an art work and as a vital part of our cultural heritage. I wish to acknowledge the magnificent contributions of $1¼ million each by Mr Robert Oatley and Mr John Schaeffer and their families. They have shown extraordinary generosity, and it represents the largest cash gift ever given to an Australian national cultural institution for the purchase of a single art work. Yesterday's unveiling highlights the importance of partnerships between the government and the private sector in the patronage and support of the arts in this country. The honourable member for New England also asks me whether I am aware of any dissenting views on the acquisition. Normally, in acquiring a work of this value, $5.3 million, you would expect there to be some controversy and dissent, because there is always hearty debate in the arts community and the community at large. But no; it has been universally acclaimed and welcomed as an invaluable work for the National Portrait Gallery. However, I must qualify that and say that there has been a sole, lone, dissenting voice - that of the honourable member for Denison. He did not issue a press statement yesterday congratulating the philanthropists or the government for their acquisition or commending the National Portrait Gallery for their perseverance over many years in finally bringing home the Cook portrait. He put out a press release headed `Captain Cook Portrait - GST in the Frame'. He makes this claim:... the cost to the Australian taxpayer for the purchase of the portrait was $5.83 million, not $5.3 million as first disclosed - the GST accounts for the extra $530,000.He goes on to say:Art galleries all over Australia will now have to find additional funds to purchase art works.Is there something wrong with that claim by the shadow minister for the opposition? There is. Put simply, what he does not understand is that it is a business input cost. What happens when it is a business input cost? You get it back. It is a tax credit. That is extraordinary. It is the same for all public galleries and across all government departments: registered galleries and collecting institutions are treated no differently from any other business. Now that you support GST, you have to understand it - at least the basics. Now that you support GST, you have got to stop misrepresenting it. That is the most blatantly ignorant or calculated deception anybody could do. It is an extraordinary statement by the shadow minister. The shadow minister also has been talking about GST. He told the Melbourne Age on 5 August this year that Labor is going to repeal the GST on books. - It is certainly going to be up towards $100 million at least. But the problem is: what books? Magazines, bound works, newspapers, brochures, newsletters? What? Tell us! What are `books'? As soon as you tell us what the roll-back on books is, we can cost it. All you are doing with your roll back on books is adding to complexity and uncertainty. The result will be increased taxes. So it is Labor again: increased taxes, broken promises.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes, I am aware of it. The answer to the second part of the question is that, although I had not specifically heard of that comment made by the chief scientist, I am not surprised. The other comment I would make is that, taken in isolation, something like that is commendable. I do not take the view that every single thing that emanates from the opposition is to be criticised; nor, in my more charitable moments, would I expect the opposition to take the view that everything that emanates from the government is to be criticised. The question of the timing, the place and so forth of the announcement of opposition policy is not something that the opposition normally consults the government on; and the timing and so forth of the announcement of government policy is not something that normally the government consults the opposition on. As always, let me assure the Leader of the Opposition: I always watch and listen very carefully to what you do and say. I have long learnt in politics that you never take your eye off your opponent. You always listen to what he has to say, you evaluate it, you assess it and you take it away. But, at the end of the day, you make your own judgment of what is good for the Australian people.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I know that the honourable member himself was in China recently, some two weeks ago, and used his visit there as an opportunity - as coalition members do when they go to China - to raise human rights issues with his Chinese interlocutors, and I appreciate the honourable member's effort.Yesterday and the evening before, a human rights dialogue, the fourth in a series, was conducted between Australian and Chinese delegations. This year the delegation was somewhat expanded - in fact, on both sides: China being represented by nine ministries and agencies; and Australia's delegation being expanded to include some members of parliament - in particular, the member for Boothby; and Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The member for Griffith was invited but, unfortunately, due to a prior engagement, was unable to attend. Professor Alice Tay, as the Chair of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, also attended.Coming from this dialogue, which discussed a wide range of concerns in the area of human rights, is the Technical Cooperation Program, a program which Australia finances to address legal reforms in respect of human rights in China. This year more initiatives are being taken in that area.The honourable member asked whether there were any alternatives. When the opposition were the government, they did not conduct a human rights dialogue of this kind with China but chose the path of an annual human rights resolution in the United Nations which they co-sponsored - the idea being that this resolution would condemn China, once passed through the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and this would somehow lead to an improvement in human rights in China. The simple fact is that that particular policy, the Labor Party's policy, has now been tried nine times and that resolution has failed on all nine occasions. It is also important to note that there will be no human rights dialogue for as long as countries like Australia co-sponsor this resolution.In 1997 this government abandoned the resolution, deciding that for us the human rights dialogue was likely to be more productive. This was roundly attacked by the Labor Party. The member for Kingsford-Smith described this as `Chamberlain style appeasement'. In a press release, the member for Kingsford-Smith - when we abandoned this resolution - said that the Howard government had a `narrow and venal conception of international affairs'. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith may be interested to know that the word `venal' means financially corrupt.At the Australian Labor Party conference this year, there were sorts of resolutions and there was a desultory discussion about foreign affairs. But I searched for reference at the Labor Party conference to the continuation of the human rights dialogue if Labor were elected - and I found it. Labor is now in favour of our human rights dialogue. Something that was `narrow and venal' and `an expedient capitulation' they are now in favour of. Search harder for the human rights resolution that they were so devoted to, and there you are: you find that the human rights resolution has been abandoned. The press releases go out. Everything that the Howard government does is an outrage, appalling, astonishing, `We are totally against it' - and a few days later they support it. You did it with the GST. You are even doing it in foreign affairs - roll-back. Roll-back is not just in GST; even in foreign affairs Mr Beazley and his team are implementing roll-back.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I note that unemployment in his region has fallen from a peak of 14.7 per cent in February 1992 when the gentleman opposite was minister for employment to just 6.7 per cent now. My department has recently completed a major study into the net impact of Work for the Dole. It compared income support outcomes for 2,100 Work for the Dole participants with outcomes for 2,100 similar job seekers not on the program. There are three key results. First, participants in Work for the Dole had a 76 per cent better chance than other job seekers of being off benefit three months later. Second, the study revealed that the net impact of Work for the Dole was 50 per cent higher than that of Working Nation programs. Third, this good result was achieved at one-third the average cost per outcome of Working Nation programs. So, despite the proven success of Work for the Dole, the Labor Party still want to abolish it. Despite the proven success of Work for the Dole, Labor still want to abolish it. They want to change the name; they want to change the nature; they want to abolish Work for the Dole. There is nothing about the program that they will ever support. The only thing they like about it is that it only lasts for six months. Someone said yesterday that people on welfare needed a government with a good heart - and that is exactly what they have got. They have a government with a good heart, not an opposition with no ticker.</DOC>

 - Of course the question, which was a polemical speech, contained numbers of false assertions and false assumptionsas one would expect from a trade union leader in this place.  - As I said, it was a polemical speech with numbers of false assertions and the fact that they are asserted does not, of course, make them true. I would say that since becoming Treasurer of the Commonwealth I have acted against numbers of Labor's tax avoidance schemesin particular R&amp;D syndication, which was supported by the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionand he opposed every step to wipe them out. We moved against the infrastructure bond scheme, also set up by the Australian Labor Party, which was considered by the -  - I am sorry; we moved against the infrastructure bond scheme, and your assertions to the contrary do not make what you say a fact. The infrastructure bond scheme was closed down by this government after advice from the tax office that it represented one of the greatest threats to the tax base introduced by the Australian Labor Party. We moved against thin capitalisation. We moved against rorts in superannuation with the superannuation surcharge - again opposed by the Australian Labor Party. - Is the Australian Labor Party proposing to repeal it? - It was opposed all along by the Australian Labor Party. Again, it opposed it all the way, seeking to make cheap political mileage, and then after it was put in place it refused to do anything about it. - I am, Mr Speaker. I am simply making the point that this government has been more active than any other government, including the Labor Party during its 13 years of mismanagement in the tax avoidance industry - all of which was left to this government to put in place because the Australian Labor Party, after 13 years, not only had not closed down those avoidance activities but had opened them. They had started them. They had started the R&amp;D syndicates. They had started the infrastructure borrowings. They had done nothing about superannuation. It was up to this government to come into office and deal with it without any assistance, with the Labor Party opposing us. We have a record of great achievement against Labor Party opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - On Monday we had the great result from the government's activity on Lifetime Health Cover and the 30 per cent rebate. While much is focused on private hospitals, people often fail to reflect on the importance of this in a number of rural areas around Australia. You would know this yourself, Mr Speaker, as your electorate has the second highest number of small private hospitals of any electorate in Australia. But in fact it is the member for Indi who has more private hospitals than anyone else, with the Bush Nursing Hospital System with hospitals in Walwa, Chiltern, Euroa, Yackandandah, Wodonga and Wangaratta. These small bush nursing hospitals have had a very difficult time over recent years, predominantly because of the drop out of private health insurance. In many communities, there is no alternative to them and their very existence has been threatened. The great news on Monday was that the increase in private health insurance that has occurred right across the country, including in rural areas, will make hospitals such as these that exist in the member for Indi's electorate much more viable. The 30 per cent rebate combined with Lifetime Health Cover gives these hospitals a degree of security they have not had for a very long time. Of course, members of the opposition would understand the importance of small rural hospitals as well. The member for Bass has one at Launceston. The member for Bendigo has Mount Alvernia Hospital. The member for Capricornia has hospitals in Rockhampton and Yeppoon. The member for McMillan has hospitals in Morwell and Neerim. Every one of these hospitals is under threat because of the Labor Party's plans to roll back the 30 per cent rebate. Every one of these hospitals' futures is at direct risk from the member for Jagajaga and the Leader of the Opposition because of their basic intrinsic dislike of the private sector and health. In many of these communities, there is no viable alternative to these longstanding private hospitals. I was staggered yesterday to be shown an article in the Wangaratta Chronicle where in fact the Labor candidate in Indi was criticising the government and calling our efforts in private health insurance blackmail. Ms Barb Murdoch said: The government is blackmailing people into taking private health cover at a time when they are confused about the GST. She also said:To do the two at once is wrong. Perhaps if you are in the Labor Party you cannot make two decisions at the one time. Her condemnation of the government's efforts in private health insurance is a direct threat to the small bush nursing hospitals in the electorate of Indi. My advice to Barb Murdoch and other Labor candidates is: be very careful when taking up press releases from the member for Jagajaga. The small private hospitals in your rural electorates are directly at risk.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is a number of things. The first thing is I do remember making that statement in 1986. The second point I would make is that the unacceptably high price of petrol now is not due to a broken promise by this government. The increase in the price of petrol is overwhelmingly due to movements in the world price of crude oil and also exchange rate variations which have moved against the Australian dollar. According to the Shell company's web site, the refinery price of petrol, that is, before excise and the goods and services tax - I repeat before excise and the goods and services tax - has risen by 8.3c a litre between 30 June and 27 August, mainly reflecting the impact of higher world oil prices and a lower exchange rate. That same data shows that the average retail price of petrol over the same period has increased by 6.7c a litre; in other words, at a lower level than the increase in the refinery price.In other words, the retail price, after you have taken into account the excise and the GST, has gone up by 6.7, yet the refinery price, which is ex the excise and the GST, has gone up by 8.3c a litre. That figure alone explodes the nonsense that has been peddled by the opposition and by the automobile companies over the past couple of weeks. But - and I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for this - that is really only the half of it, because over the weekend we had what I can only call one of those genius interviews from the member for Batman. The member for Batman was on a Channel 10 program and he was his normally expansive and friendly self. He said, `Look, we're about an inquiry establishing the facts.' And he said: I think it's a question of what is the nature of the windfall -  - `That's right,' he says - and how that windfall should be used ...The windfall, what do we do with it?Before you start thinking about what you do with a windfall, you have to have a windfall - and there is no windfall.Opposition members - Oh! - `Oh!' they say. Most of the arguments of the past few days, particularly from some of the newspapers, some of the automobile companies and the opposition, have been based on the proposition that, because the price of petrol might through the year be higher than it was at the time the budget was put together, you are going to have a much higher take through the automatic indexation of excise. I see the member for Lowe nodding in agreement with that argument. - Let me say that that argument is about the worst, the most inaccurate and the most false argument that has been advanced during the whole of this debate, because the impact of increases in the rate of inflation and prices has a negative effect on the budget, not a positive effect. The argument that, in the automatic indexation every six months, an indexation factor that is higher than was calculated at the time of the budget is going to give more money to the government is wrong. The evidence that that argument is wrong is to be found in Budget Paper No. 1 of the budget papers this year. The Treasury sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, if there was an increase of one per cent in prices, the expenses of the Commonwealth because of automatic indexation would rise by $240 million in the current financial year, yet the revenue would rise by only $100 million. So, by a factor of 2½ to 1, according to this sensitivity analysis by the Treasury - which has not been challenged by the opposition or by anybody else - the budget is in fact worse off because of the indexation arrangement. It is worse off as a result of the indexation arrangement rather than being better off. So the argument that you get a windfall through the excise collection if the price of petrol is higher than was calculated at the time of the budget is wrong, wrong, wrong and that has been the underpinning of the arguments that have been put.I thank the Leader of the Opposition for a very helpful first question. From the data that I quoted on price variations, it is clear that the reason the price of petrol has gone up is that the world price has gone up. That is the reason it has gone up. The second proposition inherent in the question of the Leader of the Opposition - that in some way the budget is dripping with additional dollars through the indexation arrangement - is also wrong. The other two sources of revenue for the budget that relate to variations in crude oil prices are the resources rent tax and the goods and services tax. Any assumption that you make now, on 28 August - a bare two months into the current financial year - is an unreliable assumption. Anybody who starts talking about a budget windfall with 10 months of the financial year to go - with certainly no idea of what oil prices are going to be for the rest of the year and with no idea of the impact of those higher oil prices, if they are sustained, on economic activity and therefore on company and income tax collections - is talking irresponsibly in those circumstances, and the government will have no part of that kind of discussion. The same comment and observation can be made in relation to any possible variations in the collection of the goods and services tax.I say very plainly to the Australian people that I do not like higher fuel prices and that I understand how sensitive the Australian people are to them. But these higher prices have been due overwhelmingly to world factors. Can I say to those who sit opposite, and to people anywhere else in the Australian community who are calling for a discretionary reduction in excise, that they are really saying that either you run down the surplus and thereby put upward pressure on interest rates or you cut payments for schools, for roads, for health and for all the other vital things that the government provides. The government will not be responding to those irresponsible calls. They are not based on fact. They seek, rather, to exploit understandable public concern about the price of petrol. I say again to the Australian public that I share its concern, but the culprits lie amongst the oil producing countries of the world; they do not lie on the front bench of the government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for the question. I regret to confirm to the House that there has been a series of incidents at the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre over the weekend and early this morning. On Saturday evening between 60 and 100 detainees were involved, and this morning between 70 and 80 detainees were involved. I am informed that the same core group of people were involved in both incidents. On Saturday evening, a group of detainees stoned buildings and were throwing rocks and implements at the staff. Those involved had taken steps to conceal their identities. Because of fear for the safety of staff on the site, one canister of tear gas was used to quell the crowd until such time as the rain forced people to return to their rooms. This morning at 5.45 South Australian time this same group deliberately set fire to a number of buildings. They have caused very extensive damage to a recreation building, two dining rooms, an ablution block and the educational facility, which has only recently been installed, as well as an accommodation block. I understand buildings in the administration area have also sustained damage from rock throwing. In addition, the internal security fence has been pushed over and a perimeter fence has been breached in a couple of places. The detainees have used the fence posts to construct weapons. As a result, tear gas and the on-site fire tender were used to push those people back from the fence to enable some repairs to be made on a temporary basis, and at this point in time there have been no escapes from the facility.I am informed that the people involved have been attempting to incite others to join in their action and they have resisted that. There are some 800 people at the centre and only 60 to 80 are involved in these incidents, most of them being young men. These are very serious questions. The behaviour is totally unacceptable. The risk to the lives and safety of the staff, as well as the community at Woomera, is obviously a concern to us. We have increased significantly the security staff on site. They have been reinforced by the Australian Protective Services, as well as the Australian Federal Police. The South Australian Police Service has sent extra officers and will be taking responsibility for the security of the Woomera township. Officers from the Australian Federal Police are also undertaking investigations, and I would expect that criminal charges will be laid in relation to this matter. I might say that this is not the first occasion. There have been people convicted of offences relating to the break-outs that occurred at Curtin and Woomera earlier in the year. I do not know that the charges have been finalised in relation to Woomera but certainly there were convictions in relation to individuals at Curtin.These steps have been taken by individuals involved I think because of a fundamental misapprehension and I think some misleading by some naive people in the Australian community who believe that inappropriate behaviour will influence the outcome of decisions that have to be taken lawfully. There are those who are advocating that there should be no borders - and some of them do not come from here, I might say; they have been associated with other organisations organising other events to take place in Australia. People who are of the view that there should be no borders, that people should turn up and be released into the community, will in no way change the detention policies which are designed deliberately to ensure that the Australian community is not put at risk in terms of their health, safety and security. Further, I would have to say to those who naively believe that behaviour of this sort might influence decisions that have to be taken by officers of my department, the Refugee Review Tribunal and, dare I say, even the courts, that nobody will achieve a different outcome by demonstrating or purporting to put us under pressure to give a different result. Some people seem to believe that, because there were demonstrations some months ago and there were releases in accordance with the law, they were in some way connected. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can assure you that there is no way that I, the government nor I think the Australian people will be coerced by behaviour of this sort. The government will be looking at any further action that it can take to ensure that those people who have been involved in rioting, civil disorder and destruction of property are dealt with in accordance with the law and, if the law is inadequate, that the law is addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for his question. I do remember the broad thrust of that interview. As always, I will do a little bit of checking to make sure that he has not relocated a comma or a full stop or a word here and there - which he does occasionally. I know it is accidental, or am I being too charitable? - I am being far too charitable saying it is accidental. I certainly remember that interview very clearly. It was an interview in which I was able to explain that the driver of higher petrol prices in Australia was, of course, the price of crude oil more than tripling from $US12 a barrel to about $US32 barrel. I think in that interview, or maybe it was another one, I was able to point out that the President of the United States was so concerned about the issue that he was proposing to raise it with the oil producing countries. I understand that during his current visit to Nigeria, which I think is the sixth largest oil producing country in the world, President Clinton is expressing the concern of the United States about the increase in petrol prices flowing from world oil prices. I think the point has to be made again and again that the regrettably high level of petrol prices in Australia is a direct consequence, overwhelmingly, of the huge increase in the price of crude oil, from something like $US12 a barrel to something like $US32 a barrel. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the figures. I do not carry those figures in my head, but what I do carry is a knowledge that the budget was based on assumptions about the increase in the CPI flowing from the once-only price effect of the introduction of the goods and services tax, the so-called GST spike. All of that was taken into account, and no matter what the individual figure may be, which the deputy leader asked me about -  - I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to anybody who is interested in this matter that, irrespective of what the assumption was, if there is any variation, not only is there extra revenue collected but also there are extra expenses incurred. The extra expenses outweigh the extra revenue by a factor of 2½ to one. I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not like this because it rather destroys the whole basis of the fraudulent fear campaign which the Labor Party and, regretfully, some of the motoring associations have been running that, because the price may have gone up a little more than was expected in May, the budget is awash with billions of additional dollars. That is wrong, Mr Speaker. The budget is not awash with billions of additional dollars. In fact, if it turns out in February of next year that the indexation factor has to be higher than calculated in May of last year, the budget will be behind because the additional outlays will be greater than the additional excise by a factor of almost 2½ to one. The only possible area where you could be ahead would be in relation to resource rent tax and the GST. You certainly do not know that with any degree -   - They don't like this, Mr Speaker, because it is the truth. They never like a factual argument. They always like to scare the electorate. They always like to run a fear campaign to scare the Australian people. I say again to my fellow Australians that I do not like high fuel prices, but it is the fault of overseas factors.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. It is hardly surprising that all of the governments of oil consuming countries are deeply concerned about the rapid rise in international oil prices. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, international oil prices in US dollar terms have gone from $12 to $32 per barrel in the last 18 months. This contrasts with OPEC's own target maximum of $US28 per barrel. Translated into Australian dollars over that period, these figures show that oil prices have increased from $18.74 per barrel to $54.67 per barrel. In March of this year, the Australian government joined with other governments in lobbying OPEC to encourage it to lift production. As a result of that lobbying effort, OPEC did indeed lift production by some three per cent. Since that time, there has been continual substantial growth in international demand for oil, especially brought about by relatively high rates of economic growth in the European Union, continuing strong growth in the United States and recovery in the East Asian economies. Bearing that in mind, obviously the supply of oil is falling short of demand and that is increasing prices. The government has now instructed Australia's ambassadors to OPEC countries to convey at the highest levels to their host governments Australia's concerns about the high level of international oil prices and to urge them to increase oil production to bring prices to a more sustainable level. Australia has been joined by a number of other countries in this effort. As the Prime Minister mentioned, the President of the United States, President Clinton, is in Nigeria at the moment. During his visit to Nigeria, he has urged the Nigerian government to increase oil production in that country. The Australian government and others in APEC will also be looking to the APEC leaders' meeting later this year as a forum where the APEC economies can put together a coordinated position encouraging an increase in supply of oil in order to keep the price at appropriate levels. This is particularly important for a country such as Australia in the Asia-Pacific region because many of the economies of East Asia are oil consumers. They have no oil production of their own - although some do - and many of those economies which are oil consumers have emerged only recently from the very deep Asian economic crisis. Too rapid a rise in international oil prices is going to jeopardise economic recovery in East Asia and that is not going to be in Australia's interests.  It is important that Australia does all it can in the international community to encourage stability in oil pricing. The increases that we have had in recent times have been far too rapid and do have the potential to damage the economies of a number of our neighbours, quite apart from the impact these increased oil prices are clearly having in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The quote that he refers to on 28 April I obviously do not have, and I have come not to rely on the word of the member for Hotham on anything. But if it was the quote that I saw in the Australian by George Megalogenis on Saturday, I was actually referring at that point to the fact that we expected prices to come off in the June quarter, as I recall. If I also recall correctly, August is not in the June quarter; August is in the September quarter - a point which was missed by George on Saturday and, since it got past George, we would not be surprised if it got past the honourable member for Hotham. In relation to excise, the indexation of excise is based on the budget estimate of the consumer price index. The Prime Minister said that as the consumer price index increases the government loses - overall, it loses money; it does not make it. That is because some 70-75 per cent of Commonwealth payments are indexed to the CPI and, as the CPI goes up, those payments, predominantly pensions, increase. If you were not to index your excise, the corollary of that would be not to index your social security payments. In all of this debate I have yet to hear one of the motoring organisations or the Labor Party say that they are against indexing payments. No, they would only take the opportunist road: index payments but not revenues. If you do not index your excises, you will not be indexing your payments. I would be taking a lot more notice of the motoring organisations if they stood up and said, `We are against indexing excise because we are against indexing pensions.' That would be a fair position.In relation to excises, of course, the one thing I have not heard from the Australian Labor Party is that they are going to abolish the indexation of excise. I listened very carefully when the question was asked three times of the member for Hotham on AM during the last week, but he did not say on one occasion that it is Labor Party policy to abolish the indexing of excise. When silence overtakes them, as it now has - there is a deathly silence from the opposition - it means that it is Labor Party policy to index excise. And why wouldn't it be? Because excise is indexed today under Labor Party legislation that was passed in 1983. We did not change any legislation to introduce indexation; it was introduced by the Labor Party in 1983. Commonwealth excise when Labor came to office was 6.1c per litre but when they left it was 34.1c. And these are the people who are now worried about excise.  - We find that Labor Party policy is to continue the indexation of excise, and their argument against it is, of course, completely opportunistic. Let me come then to goods and services tax. Goods and services tax was applied in relation to petrol after the excise was reduced by 6.7c a litre - which has never been done before; there has never been a reduction in petrol excise - and after wholesale sales tax was abolished. Wholesale sales tax impacted on the oil and petroleum industry at all stages of production, distribution and retail. The rises in relation to petrol are not the consequence of the goods and services tax. I would have thought that there would be one very clear empirical test of that: the price in the week before the introduction of goods and services tax and the price in the week afterwards where the only change was the goods and services tax. Prices were either stable or in some areas actually declined. If the rise in the price of petrol over the last week - up to $1 a litre in some places - were the fault of the GST, then I would have thought the Labor Party would promise to abolish GST and prices at the bowser would immediately fall 10 or 15c. That would be an obvious point. The Labor Party would now be promising to abolish GST and, if their argument were right, the price at the bowser would drop 10 or 15c. But again a deafening silence overtakes the Labor Party on this point. If the Labor Party were right and it abolished GST, the petrol price would come down in the United States, in Europe, in France, in Germany and in all the other countries of the world where it is rising. This argument that the Australian GST has caused an increase in the petrol price in America, in France, in Germany and in Britain where petrol prices are going up is because the world oil price has increased, as the Prime Minister said, some threefold over the last 18 months. Mr Speaker, you come across political opportunists in life, but I have never seen such a concentration of them altogether on the front bench of the Australian Labor Party. As the Prime Minister said, the world oil price is increasing because of two factors - the reduction in supply and increases in demand as the world economy strengthens. Australia is not immune from increases in the world price. That is what is driving petrol prices. As far as the government is concerned, as the CPI drives excise higher, as it does under the Labor Party legislation, the amount expended exceeds the increase in revenue. These are international developments over which Australia has only so much influence as it can bring to bear in international fora. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is doing a fantastic job. I will be taking it up myself. That is real policy rather than the political opportunism of the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. The House will recall the golden words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who was in favour of bigger surpluses than the government last week. On the one hand he is totally opposed to all of the revenues but on the other hand he is totally in favour of bigger surplus budgets. He is also in favour of rolling back the GST, which means less revenue. He is also in favour of more money spent on health and education and the regions, presumably less revenue out of petrol and he is going to produce bigger surpluses. He seems to be rather at odds with the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, one will recall, did have a chance to produce a surplus budget. He was the Minister for Finance during the period of the last Labor government   -  - He leaps to his feet with loud frivolity. The record of the Leader of the Opposition is as follows - in 1994-95 a deficit of $13,181 million. I suppose we call that a negative surplus, produced on a growth rate of 4½ per cent. This is the other point the Labor Party have been trying to get out. They are saying: `We couldn't produce surpluses because the economy wasn't growing.' It grew at 4½ per cent and the budget deficit was $13.1 billion. The next year, in 1995-96, the deficit outcome was $10 billion. Again the economy grew at 4½ per cent and the deficit was $10 billion. Excellent growth. An excellent budget outcome, I suppose. You will recall that the now finance minister, who was extolling his own virtues - $23 billion of deficits in two years - went around the country during that period claiming the budget was in surplus. It was one of the most disgraceful acts of misrepresentation in Australian modern economic history. He said during the 1996 campaign that the budget was in surplus when he was running a $10,000 million deficit. To my knowledge the Leader of the Opposition has never yet apologised for misleading the Australian people. In fact, he is still at it. He went up to the Queensland Country Women's Association in Townsville on 23 August to perpetuate this misrepresentation. After attacking the government for all of the expenditure restraint which went into producing a surplus budget, he attacked us over the expenditure restraints on universities, public schools, the elderly, dental, public hospitals, the labour market, the unemployed, and welfare programs. He attacked every expenditure reduction that this government put in place. He said, `The cuts were supposed to be there because they said they had a budget problem. They never did have one.'So it was no budget problem to have a $10 billion deficit. The only way in which the Labor Party ever commits itself to surpluses is the kind of surplus which is negative by $10,000 million. That is the only surplus you have ever committed yourself to. You are into the business of revisionist history. You are redefining your own fiscal failure. You have never apologised for misleading the public. Your only surpluses could be produced by redefining the terms and never by real policy.  - The promises by the member for Hotham that he will produce surpluses should be understood in the same way as the declarations of the Leader of the Opposition in favour of surpluses - a surplus of minus $10,000 million. He never had the decency to do the right thing and could never manage an economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question but, as usual, he completely misleads. - No, the ACCC is actually right; you are wrong. The ACCC press release headed `Petrol price movements on 1 July' reads as follows:Major capital city petrol prices have, on average, fallen from yesterday's prices. Sydney's unleaded petrol prices increased by 0.2 cents per litre; Melbourne declined by 0.4 cents per litre; Brisbane declined by 0.3 cents per litre ... Perth declined by 0.9 cents per litre. The smaller capital cities experienced increases of 0.8 cents per litre in Hobart; 0.5 cents per litre in Darwin ...Petrol price movements on 1 July - major capital city petrol prices have, on average, fallen. - I was asked about what I said on the Today show and what I said in my previous answer, which was that the ACCC has found that, on average, petrol prices had either been the same or had reduced. That is precisely what the ACCC said on 1 July - that, on average, petrol prices had fallen. If it were the case that a GST increased petrol prices, how would they, on average, fall across capital cities? - So now the big point is: when you say `average' it means different from `overall'. That is his knockout point: when you say `overall' it is completely different from `on average'. `Overall' means `on average'. It goes through all of those capital cities. It says that on average they fell. The GST came in. If the GST were a cause of a 10c or 15c increase, how was it from 30 June to 1 July that prices were on average the same or fell? How could it be in any capital city that that would be the case? How could it be the case that the change of taxation did not lead to a change of price? What actually happened was that, over the course of the months of July and August, as the world price increased it put petrol prices up in the United States, in Europe and in Japan, none of whom had a new GST introduced according to Australian legislation. I would have thought the real question for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be: how did the Australian GST lift petrol prices in the United States? How did the Australian GST lift prices in Europe? How did it lift prices in Japan? It did not. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can report to the House that the tax reform in Australia - which may or may not be opposed by the Australian Labor Party; we don't yet know - has won widespread international support. The Moody's Investor Service said in its annual report that Australia's ceiling for foreign currency debt and domestic debt ratings reflects an increasingly flexible economy and sound macro-economic policies. Moody's said, `Australia's credit strength arises from a service sector oriented economy that is modern and increasingly diverse. Supporting the economy's growth potential and capacity to adjust to external shocks is a comprehensive program of structural reforms which in recent years has focused on trade liberalisation, industry deregulation and tax and labour market reforms.'So international ratings agencies note that the tax and labour market reforms which have been introduced by this government are underpinning a strengthening economy which is underpinning our rating. Mr Yves Lemay from Moody's said in his statement on Friday 25 August 2000, `The new tax regime should boost economic growth. The overall growth potential should benefit from this new tax structure and, from a broad macro perspective, the transition into this new tax structure is running relatively smoothly.' There you have international recognition of the importance of tax reform under this government. We know that it was opposed every single step of the way by the Australian Labor Party, which thought Australia should have a wholesale sales tax instead of a goods and services tax - a tax which is now shared by only one other country in the world, Swaziland; championed only by the government of Swaziland and the Australian Labor Party leadership.I do not know whether or not the Australian Labor Party are now in favour of tax reform. They keep claiming, when they give speeches, that they are in favour of tax reform - having opposed every single step which was required to get there, in the same way they opposed every single step of balancing the budget and then said they were actually in favour of surpluses. I cannot tell, Mr Speaker. We are awaiting the roll-back policy - where the Labor Party rolls back the goods and services tax - and we await with even greater interest how they intend to pay for that, presumably with increased income taxes and presumably with increased petrol excises. This now is becoming a modern economy. It is being backed up by good strong tax reform that is benefiting people throughout Australia but particularly those in the areas which have been held back by the inefficient wholesale sales tax. It will make Australia a stronger economy and it will lead to more jobs.</DOC>

 - It is always handy to refer to the actual press releases, because you can be sure of one thing: they will be absolutely misquoted by the Leader of the Opposition. That press release goes through various places, and it finds that in some places petrol prices moved upwards and in some places they moved down. It commences with this sentence:Petrol prices in the major capital cities fell, on average, today following a similar fall on Saturday 1 July. It falls on 1 July, it falls again on 3 July, the goods and services tax was applying throughout Australia, including capital cities -  - The press release found that, overall, petrol prices fell. In some areas, as I said, they went up and in some areas they went down, but the GST applied in capital cities. If the GST were the cause of rises, why were petrol prices falling in capital cities? Did the GST not apply in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide - the point I made on the Today show? I do want to refer to one other thing from that press release, because I think it is worth noting. - I am asked by the shadow minister for finance: `If it wasn't the GST, what was it?' The largest increases found by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission were, according to the press release, in Hobart. It states:On average petrol prices in Hobart increased by 2.5 cents per litre since the week prior to 1 July to around 95.9 cents per litre ... There is a wide variation in petrol prices within Hobart and across Tasmanian towns. Tasmanian petrol prices have been affected by the above influences and by the Tasmanian Government's removal of a fuel subsidy of 1.95 cents per litre - The largest increases noted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in that press release, which I am asked about, were in the state of Tasmania, where the Tasmanian government, under cover of A New Tax System, removed a subsidy of 1.95c per litre. The government of Tasmania is a Labor government. The Treasurer of Tasmania is Dr David Crean. On 1 July, without making an announcement, the Labor government of Tasmania abolished a 1.95c a litre subsidy, sending up prices in Tasmania by 2.5c. It was when the Commonwealth found out about that - and Mr Bacon was in London with the Prime Minister -  - Fortunately, I actually had the press release that I was asked a question about. There was a subsidy throughout the whole of Tasmania, including the whole of regional Tasmania. It was 1.95c per litre -  - Let's go to Queensland. As I recall, Labor Premier Beattie, in his last budget, tried to wipe out an 8c a litre subsidy on Queensland petrol. It was because the Commonwealth found out about it, and the Commonwealth said to the Labor government that if they did not reinstate that subsidy we would be cutting the GST revenues, that Mr Beattie reinstated it. The same thing happened in Tasmania. Without any announcement whatsoever, the Labor government and its Treasurer, Dr David Crean, withdrew a subsidy on 1 July. It took some days before the Commonwealth found out about it. When the Commonwealth told the Tasmanian Labor government  that we would be deducting their GST payments, whilst Premier Bacon was in London and Dr David Crean was on leave, poor old Acting Premier Lennon was sent out to say, with great embarrassment, that the Tasmanian Labor Party would be reinstating it. So here we have the evidence. Queensland Labor withdraws 8c a litre. Tasmanian Labor withdraws 1.95c a litre. Labor asks about regional pricing, the largest increase was in Tasmania, and who was responsible? The Australian Labor Party - caught! Not only is it the same party but there is an even closer relationship with the person who asked these questions. I will tell you where the great threat to petrol price rises comes from: it comes from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. The question gives me the opportunity to bring to the notice of the House a document which was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week entitled A portrait of Australian exporters. It is a very important document because it highlights the importance of small business in Australia's export effort. We have seen in recent years a bigger effort by small business, and I want to say to the small business community: `Good on you for having a go. It is fantastic for Australia. You are creating more jobs and it is very good for the national economy.' In 1997-98 there were 21,800 exporting businesses in Australia. Of these, 77 per cent were small businesses. They accounted for 13 per cent of Australia's gross revenue generated by exports. It is not only your medium sized small business but also the very small businesses - the microbusinesses employing fewer than four people. They have also been expanding. In fact, in 1997-98 the number of those businesses grew by 11 per cent per annum, reflecting a very strong trend. Of the 21,800 exporters, 4,000 of them were in services-only exports. But, here again, small business is a very strong player: of those, 88 per cent were, in fact, small businesses. I was asked what was driving this growth. There is no doubt what is driving this growth: it is a series of sensible reforms made by the Howard government which gives a bit of encouragement to small business. We halved the capital gains tax. We got interest rates down. We have a better workplace relations system. We are putting a lot of incentives in place for the small business community, and it is great that they are responding. Of course, on top of that, the goods and services tax is great for exporters and is, therefore, great for our small businesses and gives them more encouragement. I was also asked whether there were any alternative plans to foster this growth in small business. The sad truth of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party has absolutely no policy to support small business. In their platform entitled `Engaging with the global economy', in which they say they are after creating better jobs through trade, there is, in fact, no mention whatsoever of small business. Here is this great dynamic sector out there doing a great job for Australia - growing, building, creating jobs, investing and improving their fair share - and do they get a word from the Labor Party? Not one word of interest, support or encouragement. But that would hardly be a surprise. It was only a few days ago - in fact, in July - that the Leader of the Opposition spelt out his attitude to small business when he said:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.What a statement of the obvious! They used their numbers in the Senate to stop unfair dismissal laws and they used their numbers in the Senate to prevent sensible tax reform for the benefit of the small business community. Now, of course, we have the old roll-back policy sitting there to create more technical red tape for the small business community. That is pretty depressing for the small business community. It reveals the fact that the Labor Party are not prepared to support them.  I was very interested in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition on Townsville radio last week. He was asked what his attitude was when somebody exposes the fact that you do not have a decent policy on some particular issue. The Leader of the Opposition was asked about the satirical radio program Cactus Island. In a light moment he said that he was deeply depressed by it. Then he went on to say:The most devastating things in politics are satire and cartoons. You can pick a fellow's commentary - I suppose he was talking about John Della Bosca - on some activity you've done during the day and it will depress you as the logic is sort of turned remorselessly on you and you feel `Oh, gee, how will I ever recover from this?' But the reality is that within an hour of getting to work you realise nobody has read the column -  - In conclusion, there is a lot to be said on behalf of the small business community. It is a serious topic that the Labor Party has no policy. Not only do you have no policy, you use your numbers in the Senate - as you will this week - against the interests of small business, which costs this country jobs. When you see the cartoons revealing the inadequacy of your policies, then finally, maybe, the truth is out. So my present to the Leader of the Opposition is a few cartoons of him and his roll-back, speaking the truth, which is something he ought to take into account. - I will put them on the wall.</DOC>

 - In a choice between the member for Hotham and the member for Bonython about who has got it right, I take the member for Bonython any time. As he says, the world price has gone up, there is no doubt about that. With regard to the effect on the PRRT, that depends on a number of factors, the first of which, of course, is what the companies themselves do in relation to other exploration that has not any relation to other expenditures.The idea of the PRRT, when it was introduced - I think it was actually introduced by the Labor Party, by Mr Griffiths from memory; it was certainly introduced by the Labor Party - was, as I recall it, that the petroleum extractors would be taxed on their profits, except to the degree that they used it for new production or other exploration. In fact, that is a good policy aim. If they use it for new production or other exploration, you can actually get to a situation where your receipts go down in the short term, because you are going for longer-term recoveries. I have seen some of this commentary in the press that assumes that the price is fully reflected straight into profit and straight into tax; that is not the idea and it was not the idea when it was introduced, and it does not work that way. The Labor Party introduced it with that in mind, and we have kept it with that in mind. I would certainly advise those people who are considering it to consider it with a proper understanding of how it operates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I note that unemployment in south-east Brisbane has fallen from a peak of 15.7 per cent in January 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment, to just seven per cent now. It is still too high, but it is certainly a welcome improvement under the Howard government. Last week, the government announced more than 300 new Work for the Dole projects, involving more than 4,000 job seekers. This brings the total for the year to nearly 2,000 new projects, involving nearly 30,000 job seekers. These projects involve a wide variety of beneficial work experience such as helping in community child-care centres, designing web sites for community organisations and building boats for sailors with disabilities.I have been asked about threats to this great program. It is true, as the member for Werriwa pointed out today, that Labor has an honourable tradition of supporting mutual obligation. Unfortunately, that tradition has been completely betrayed by the Labor Party's current leadership. The Leader of the Opposition originally described work for the dole as `a disgracefully shoddy piece of public policy'. The member for Batman described it as `evil'. Lately, the member for Dickson has been trying to insist -  -  - Yes, the absent member for Dickson has been trying to insist that Labor supports Work for the Dole, even though it wants to change the name and the nature of the program - bring in a Claytons work for the dole: the program you have when you have abolished Work for the Dole. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition confirmed Labor's complete rejection of Work for the Dole when he said in Townsville:Work for the Dole is about making a small section of the unemployed the target of public opinion. It is a facade. It is about attacking the unemployed and not attacking the problem.What can you say about a party that says, on the one hand, that Work for the Dole is evil and, on the other hand, that it invented Work for the Dole?On this subject, the Labor Party have hit more false notes than Tiny Tim. They do not know where they stand. Labor oppose Work for the Dole. They will always oppose Work for the Dole because Labor are too weak to stand up to the `all rights and no responsibilities' brigade which has done so much to hurt and betray the decent people and the battlers of this country. </DOC>

 - I am greatly indebted to the member for the Northern Territory for his intervention, because it gives me the opportunity again to make a point that was made, I thought quite eloquently, by the member for Bonython when he asked a question a few moments ago, and that was that the price of petrol has gone up because the world price of crude oil has gone up. The reality is this. Nothing has happened over the last hour and a quarter. This was the big assault on petrol. We have had a week of headlines and a week of campaigning from the motoring organisations, and this was the big assault from the Australian Labor Party. The member for the Northern Territory introduces  -  - That is true. It is true, as the member for the Northern Territory said, that I went to the beautiful town of Nyngan. I did receive a very warm reception in Nyngan and I did talk about the empathy between the government and the people of Nyngan and about the concern of the Liberal and National parties for the people of Nyngan, our desire to produce better economic conditions and how we had delivered but we still had a long way to go. I say to the people of Nyngan that I do not like the fact that you are now paying more for your fuel than you were a few months ago. I hate that.  - None of us likes that. But one of the interesting things that I can tell the member for the Northern Territory is that the gap in Northern Territory fuel prices between city and regional fuel prices following the introduction of the goods and services tax actually fell. In June of this year, the gap in Alice Springs was 9.7c a litre, in July it was 8.7c a litre and in July of 1999 it had been 9.9c a litre. In June of this year, the gap in Katherine was 4.8c; it had fallen to 4.2c by July. In Tennant Creek, it was 8.3c in June and it had fallen to 7.1c in July. This hardly suggests that the introduction of the goods and services tax has worsened the economic position. - What matters in this whole debate is what people around Australia are paying for petrol and why they are paying that price. Overwhelmingly, it is because the world price of petrol has gone up. We have now had an extended question time, by any measure, and in an hour and 20 minutes the Australian Labor Party has not produced one iota of evidence to gainsay the proposition that I put right at the beginning of question time. Let me take the member for the Northern Territory back to what I said at the beginning of question time. I said that the price of petrol at the bowser, which I understand is painfully and unacceptably high to Australian motorists, is due overwhelmingly to the increase in the price of crude oil. If the world price of crude oil goes from US$12 a barrel to US$32 a barrel, it is plain ridiculous to pretend that that does not have a massive impact on the price of petrol at the Australian bowsers. I again remind the member for the Northern Territory of the information that is contained on the Shell web site, which points out that the refinery price of petrol, that is, the price before  - I repeat, the price before - you impose excise or GST has gone up by 8.3c a litre between 30 June and yesterday. The refinery price goes up by 8.3c a litre, and that is directly the result -   - I am again grateful for the further intervention of the member for the Northern Territory, because he draws attention to my very next point. Let me remind him that the refinery price went up by 8.3c. The refinery price is the price before you impose an excise or a GST, and, if the retail price against the refinery price rises by 8.3c a litre, if the retail price has only risen by 6.7c a litre, it hardly makes any sense to argue that the GST and the excise have aggravated the situation. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. The government has made significant efforts to achieve workable native title regimes around Australia. The Commonwealth has been working closely with the Carr government and the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council on native title issues relating to low impact mining and petroleum exploration generally in New South Wales. The Carr government has requested determinations in relation to its low impact exploration regime, which would give native title claimants benefits in excess of those under the Native Title Act. We have been discussing a way of ensuring that, if I make the relevant determination, the additional benefits for the native title claimants under the New South Wales legislation will be secure. We understand that the Carr government and the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council will shortly notify us that they agree with this approach. I have to say, however, that this option is not one available in respect of the Queensland regime. There has also been movement on other fronts in relation to native title. Determinations I made in relation to opal mining at Lightning Ridge have been through the Senate without a murmur from Labor. Last week, I met representatives of the Western Australian Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander representative bodies to hear their views on the proposed Western Australian alternative regime. At the request of the Northern Territory government, I am reconsidering the Northern Territory's proposed alternative regime and will engage in further consultation with indigenous bodies in respect of that. The member for Dawson asked about alternative policies. That brings us to Queensland. The Democrats' motion to disallow my determinations in relation to the Queensland alternative provisions is due to be debated by Wednesday. Premier Beattie has been pleading for months for federal Labor to deliver certainty to the people of Queensland. On the ABC's AM program this morning, the Queensland Indigenous Working Group chairman, Terry O'Shane, said:We would expect, given the assurance by the Leader of the Opposition two weeks ago that they would uphold the full blown right to negotiate, that the federal opposition will vote against the Queensland government's proposition that is before them in the Senate this week.However, this morning the ABC also reported the Leader of the Opposition as saying:We are holding discussions to see if we can arrive at a position which permits that to go ahead and the benefits from a state regime that the Queensland government believes will flow can flow. But at the same time the situation of the native title owners is protected.The government is engaged in transparent and accountable dealings with states, territories and indigenous groups. At the death knock, Labor is trying to concoct a secret deal, leaving native title claimants, Queensland miners, the Australian public and even Premier Beattie in the dark.</DOC>

 - To put it mildly, I think it is a touch disingenuous for a member of a political party that wants to get rid of the $500 million program designed to reduce the gap between city and country petrol prices to have the gall -  - Your mate from Hunter is up here recommending the abolition of this $500 million program. Now we have the member for Canning asking me a question. The truth of the matter is that, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out to me and as shown by those figures I read out in reply to the question from the now departed member for the Northern Territory, the gap between country and city prices is smaller now than it used to be. The reason it is smaller is the $500 million rebate - and the member for Hunter has been up here advocating the abolition of it. He smiles in pleasure at the reminder. It is the best run he has had for six months, because they have been up here advocating the abolition. So I would say to the member for Canning: if you care about Kalgoorlie, go and talk to the member for Hunter. You go and get the member for Hunter to change the commitment he made to the good people of his own electorate - and they are good people - to abolish a $500 million subsidy. That was the program that was designed to ensure that the gap between the city and country prices was smaller historically than it has been for a very long time. Can I say to the member for Canning what I said to the member for the Northern Territory? It is now 3.30 p.m.; we have now been going for 90 minutes, and nothing has altered the central proposition of the government. We do not like these high fuel prices. I say to my fellow Australians: we regret them very much, but they are due to increases in the world price of fuel. They are not due to the GST.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. The government's policy of parallel importation removes import restrictions on popular consumer items - CDs, books, software, video games and the like. These reforms will allow Australian importers to obtain these products as soon as they are released anywhere in the world at the most competitive price. So consumers benefit through cheaper prices and a wider array of choice. Vested interests trying to retain the sole rights of their monopoly will cry foul and oppose these reforms. Naturally, that is to be expected because they have had a very, very good run with their import monopoly. The government's policy is endorsed by the Independent Review Committee on Intellectual Property and Competition, the Ergas committee, which released its report on this issue in April. It said:... restrictions do allow higher prices to be charged for the protected material than would otherwise prevail.The ACCC issued a statement at the same time also supporting the government's position in defence of consumers. So who in their right mind would be opposed to the government's parallel importation policy? Well, I have unearthed that rarest of documents - an Australian Labor Party policy.Government members - Oh! - Well, it is a policy statement. -  - They normally do not exist, but this one was released late last week by the shadow minister for industry and technology, the member for Fraser, and the member for Denison, the shadow minister for the arts. It is only two pages, so it skims over the issues very briefly; nonetheless it states that they will continue the import monopoly that exists at present to the disadvantage of consumers. So you can imagine what the Australian Consumers Association, the ACA, said in regard to this policy. Mr Charles Britton, representing the ACA, said the policy was:... a very poor way of assisting local industry and delivered a pale imitation of parallel importation.But the real explanation of what lies behind this statement was given by the member for Fraser in a Sky TV interview on Thursday. He said, in relation to the government's policy, the policy is to:... try to just drive down the prices. It's entirely driven by consumer interest which I don't think will work ...That is his explanation of the government's parallel importation policy. I will repeat it. It is one of the great lines of political history. The government's policy is to:... try to just drive down the prices.That is our first crime: to try to drive down the prices. Our second crime, to quote him, is:It's entirely driven by consumer interest ...Good Lord! So the vested interests are running the Labor Party. Who came out in support of the Labor Party's restrictive, monopolist policy? The AMWU - the good old AMWU - came out, and the Visual Software Distributors Association. So I ask the Leader of the Opposition: is this your policy? Was it endorsed by the shadow cabinet? Is the rest of the frontbench aware of this policy? Because those members told the Financial Review  last Friday:If Labor wins the next election, it will seek to repeal the Government's parallel importation legislation, introduced in 1998, which allows retailers to import CDs without waiting for permission from the Australian licence holder.So there you have it: it is roll-back again in a different area from taxation, but again the taxpayer or consumer is the loser.</DOC>

 - The provisions made by the government in relation to old Australians, as part and parcel of the introduction of the goods and services tax, have been, I believe, very appropriate and they have been widely supported within the Australian community. In contradistinction to the language used by the member for Lilley, let me remind him of the introduction up-front of a four per cent increase in the real value of the pension -  - The member for Lilley asked me a question about the financial position of older Australians, particularly those on the pension, and I would have thought the thing that was most germane to their financial security was income security. What we have done is to guarantee that they will always be two per cent in real terms better off than they would otherwise have been, after making full allowance for any increases in the consumer price increase. We have guaranteed something you never did, and that is 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have guaranteed an increase in the pension by two per cent in real terms. - We introduced that. Also, in relation to older Australians - whether they are retired, whether they are dependent on the pension or partly dependent on the pension - I might indicate that one of the consequences of the reforms that came in on 1 July was that tens of thousands more Australians became entitled either to a full pension or to a part pension because of the alteration of the income limit arrangements that obtained just prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax. There are quite a number of other provisions that have been brought in by the government. The generosity of the health insurance rebate - which the Labor Party is pledged to wind back at least, if not abolish altogether - is widely applauded by older Australians. The member for Lilley asked me about the deeming arrangements. The deeming arrangements have been clearly understood, and action taken in relation to those deeming arrangements is in accordance with what has been previously enunciated and understood. When you take into account the totality of the benefits that have been brought in for older Australians, they are significantly in advance of what obtained on 30 June.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. As honourable members would know, between August and October 1998 we ran a measles control campaign amongst primary schoolchildren which was highly successful. We managed to get to 1.7 million schoolchildren, and the result of this has been that the rate of measles has dropped dramatically - so much so that in September last year there was not a single case of measles in New South Wales, for the first time since 1788.However, there is one group that is subsequently proving to be difficult, and that is 18- to 30-year-olds. People in this group are too old to have been exposed to the `second dose of measles, mumps and rubella' campaign and too young to have been exposed to measles in the wild. To give you an idea of how the rate of measles has dropped in Australia, in 1993 and 1994 we had between 4½ thousand and 5,000 cases of measles a year, and we dropped to only 236 cases of measles last year. However, that is still too many. Over a third of those cases occurred in Victoria and, interestingly, 90 per cent of them occurred in 18- to 30-year-olds. There was one outbreak that we were able to trace to a single person, a 21-year-old woman who had come back from a holiday in Bali. She worked in a major movie complex in Melbourne, and she had passed it on to 18 different people we could verify with direct contact. Because of this, I am pleased to be able to inform honourable members that the federal government has decided it will fund vaccines for all Australians between 18 and 30 years of age. We will have state and territory governments deliver it through normal mechanisms, and we will also use general practitioners. We believe that we can do this over the next 12 months, and chances are that this has the very real possibility of eliminating measles completely. An incidental benefit is that, as there are also low levels of immunity to rubella in this age group, we should have a very good chance of dramatically lowering the rate and threat of rubella as well. If we do this and if we eliminate measles entirely from Australia, as we have done with polio, then it would be a remarkable achievement. It shows the benefit of trying to prevent illness rather than just treating it once it happens.</DOC>

 - I am aware that that financial institution has made some other arrangements. Certainly, it is the government's view that banks should be passing on the savings that have been made through the introduction of the new tax system. It is important that people, particularly those on pensions or low incomes, shop around to get the best deeming rate that they can. There are 70 financial institutions that are offering competitive rates. If pensioners in particular wish to access information, they can contact Centrelink or the FACS web site. We suggest that pensioners shop around to get the best financial arrangements from banks; there are over 70 financial institutions that are offering these rates.</DOC>

 - I am aware of such comments, and I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. We have heard a great deal from the opposition over the last week about the government's legislation to restore equity and fairness to school funding. When the Labor Party was in office, there was a decreasing level of fairness and a growing level of injustice in the funding for schools. For many years, the parish schools throughout this country were funded at a level well below their assessed level of need. An inequitable funding system was left in place which refused to fund new schools according to their level of need. This government has restored, through this legislation, fairness in funding so that the neediest parents will get increased support. One of the greatest distortions -  -  - One of the greatest distortions that was made by the Labor Party last week was the suggestion that in some way the government's legislation is unfair because it includes more funding for non-government than government schools. It is the case that for many years there has been an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states that the states will provide some 85 per cent of the funding for government schools and the Commonwealth provides the bulk of the funding for non-government schools. So there is absolutely no point whatever in comparing funding for government and non-government schools in this legislation. And that was exactly the case when the Labor Party was in office. The Labor Party's last school legislation encouraged more funding for non-government schools than for government schools -   - because that has been the basis of Commonwealth funding for schools for almost two decades. Despite that, the Commonwealth government is increasing funding in this legislation for government schools more rapidly than any state government in Australia. Under this legislation, government schools will receive -  - I am responding, of course, to public comment about school funding. The Commonwealth will be spending some $402 million more on government schools this year - not under the new legislation but this year -  - This year the Commonwealth will be spending some $402 million more on government schools than in 1996 when the Labor Party legislated the amount of funding for government schools. This is an increase of 26 per cent by the Howard government on government schools over the last four years. At the same time the number of pupils in government schools has increased by 2.3 per cent. So there has been a massive increase in funding for government schools by this government and, although we do not have primary responsibility for funding government schools, this illustrates the essential fairness and equity of the schools funding legislation of this government. In addition, for the non-government schools, let me simply make the point that every non-government school organisation - Catholic and non-Catholic, independent, Christian schools - supports the basis on which the Commonwealth government is proposing to legislate to fund schools. As Peter Crimmins, the executive officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, has said, choice in schooling is now a reality for working-class families. You would think from the debate last week that the opposition are violently opposed to this legislation. They do not like it, they do not like its principles, they are violently opposed to it, and therefore one might assume they are going to oppose it. But no, the Leader of the Opposition made it clear on 4 August: We have accepted the changed basis of the needs arrangement associated with the private schools.He went on to say - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Coonabarabran happens to be in my electorate, and it is a place where, interestingly enough, petrol prices are often quite high in contrast with the surrounding towns. But let me put this into some overall perspective, because there is no doubt that the opposition are very good at the selective quoting of some isolated statistics. People in the electorate are undoubtedly bearing the difficulties of higher fuel prices. But, of all the commentators on fuel, the one thing you can say with certainty is that the ALP would be the last people to have any credibility on this at all. I do not always agree with the motoring organisations' perspective on everything, but I am indebted to the AAA's Informed sources document, which points out that, if you compare on a raw average the June 2000 price gap across Australia with the July raw average, there was a reduction in the country-city price of 1.3c per litre. In simple terms for those opposite, the country-city price differential has narrowed quite substantially, particularly between June and July this year. - About three days ago I bought fuel out there. Interestingly enough, I noticed in Gunnedah, which is my home town, that for the first time since I can remember the price was within striking distance of the price in Sydney on that day. In fact, the differential was the lowest I can recall. But, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has selectively quoted Coonabarabran today, let me simply refer to the average price in June of this year - the price differential between Coonabarabran and the raw average in urban Australia. He does not want to hear this. - Let me come back to Coonabarabran. I know the town well; I actually pay rates in the shire there. In June of this year, on a raw average basis, the difference between average prices in that town and urban prices paid across Australia was 9.4c - quite high. But do you know what it was in July? It was 5.8c - a considerable reduction. The fact of the matter is that, when these people opposite talk about tax on fuel, they want you to ignore the fact that they were the absolute masters of ripping tax out of fuel - a 500 per cent increase. - I think it will suffice to conclude on this note -  -  - Well, I could keep going. I could talk about the fact that you opposed us every inch of the way on the $2.2 billion reduction in excise on fuel in this country. The member for Batman was out there on the weekend making all sorts of claims about his contribution to the debate - and he sidelined himself on fuel. - Again! Goodness! - Suffice it to say that, when we came to power in March 1996, for every dollar spent on fuel in this country by motorists, the excise burden under Labor was 58.6 per cent; today, under us, it is 47.2 per cent. I think the case is open and closed: when it comes to rip-off merchants on fuel, you people raised it to an art form.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair, who is a very strong advocate of the interests of small business within his electorate. Unlike the representatives of the Australian Labor Party, he belongs to a party that is a party for small business - the Liberal Party of Australia, who, along with the National Party of Australia, have done very good things for small business. From a survey that has been released today, it would seem that the confidence of the small business sector in the Australian community is very strong indeed, which is good news for small business and bad news for Labor. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index released today reveals that small business confidence rose sharply over the last three months. This is the period that followed the introduction of the GST. If you go back to when the last survey came out, those opposite were up there saying, `Look at this, Prime Minister. Look at this, Treasurer. Doesn't this demonstrate how the small business community of Australia is trembling with fear about the introduction of the goods and services tax?' But what today's survey reveals is that more than 60 per cent of small businesses are confident about their prospects for the next 12 months. According to the author's comments, the surge in confidence reflected an easier than anticipated reaction to the introduction of the new tax system. In other words, small business having been frightened by the campaign of the Australian Labor Party - deliberately frightened - it will always be remembered that the Labor Party wanted small business to be hurt by the GST. They wanted small business to be damaged. They wanted the Australian economy to be damaged and they are disappointed, indeed politically saddened, by the reality that the Australian small business community has embraced this change, and is embracing it increasingly as time goes by.The survey found that 62 per cent of small businesses are in favour of the GST - the highest figure recorded by the survey to date. According to the survey, the main reason that businesses support the GST is that they regard it as a fair system. This is not the testimony of the government. This is not the testimony of the Liberal Party or of the federal Treasury or of the Australian Taxation Office. This is the testimony of the hundreds of thousands of men and women in Australia who run small businesses. They are saying, `It is a great reform; it is a great new system. We support it because we think it is fair and we think it is good for Australia.' That is why we introduced the system. As the days ago by, more evidence accumulates of the mature judgment being made by the people of Australia about the depth and the quality of this historic reform to Australia's taxation system. As every day and as every week go by, more and more will reflect in a negative way on the attempt by the Australian Labor Party to sabotage and destroy a visionary attempt by this government to give this country a decent taxation system. It will always be remembered that Labor hoped that small business would be hurt. Labor hoped that small business would reject it. Labor hoped that the Australian people would be damaged by the introduction of the new system. The evidence is now accumulating that that was never going to happen. Now that small business people have had an opportunity to savour the new system, they are voting in favour of a change that is good for them and good for the Australian people. </DOC>

 - Through you, Mr Speaker: I would have thought that, after the disappointing experience you had in relation to your attempts to talk the Australian economy down regarding the introduction of the new taxation system, you may have learned something. You may have learned that occasionally the Australian people appreciate both of their major political parties talking optimistically about this country's future. But in the lead-up to the introduction of the new taxation system you deliberately set about trying to instil fear and concern in the minds of the Australian community. The totality of that survey indicates very clearly that, compared with the previous survey, there has been a huge turnaround in the attitude of the small business community. The one defining event that has occurred between the last survey and this survey is the introduction of the new tax system. That turnaround can only be attributed to the fact that the new tax system has been received far more optimistically than the Labor Party hoped would be the case. It has been received very optimistically, and in those circumstances I can only say again to those who sit opposite: your negative, destructive, carping tactics have again failed, as they will in relation to the other reforms that will be introduced by the government during the remainder of this term.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. While we are on the question of small business, confidence and profits, I point out that company profits which were released today for the June quarter 2000 show that, over the course of the year, company profits before income tax, interest and depreciation rose by 30.7 per cent, which I think all members of this House would welcome - a strong rise in company profits. Interestingly enough, the last question of the survey was about profits. On a national accounts basis, corporate profits accounted for 24 per cent of GDP in the March quarter, one of the highest profit shares, and these company profits have been produced in a low inflationary environment and at a time when employment has been increasing. A 30.7 per cent increase in company profits over the quarter indicates that corporate Australia is strong and healthy. I am sure that both sides of parliament will welcome a healthy corporate sector in Australia. It was widely tipped by the Australian Labor Party that tax reform in Australia would be a nightmare. You will recall that the Labor Party's argument was that Australia could not follow the advanced economies of the world and Australia needed a wholesale sales tax. In a completely opportunistic and economically vandalistic way, they argued for years that, alone of the industrialised countries of the world, Australia would not be able to cope with a value added tax. The small business survey, to which the Prime Minister has already referred, indicated that in May 2000 small business was saying, nearly two to one, that the government had been doing a bad job in implementing the new tax system. However, after its introduction in August 2000, that was completely reversed, with small business saying, by 46 to 28, that the government was doing a good job - a two to one majority the other way. That is an enormous turnaround in the view of small business, from May 2000, when the Labor Party fear campaign and disinformation was at its height, to August 2000, when small business had the opportunity to interact with the new taxation system.For the first time ever in this survey, a much more interesting question was asked. Tax reform has become a reality and, as we know, the Labor Party campaign to defeat tax reform was not successful. But the Labor Party has not given up on GST. It has not come into the modern world. It has not really come forward with any economic responsibility, because the Labor Party's campaign is now to roll back the GST. Isn't it funny: we have not heard much about roll-back over the last two weeks. Roll-back was the policy that was going to surf the Leader of the Opposition into office. Roll-back, he said, would make GST simpler. Roll-back, he said, would be supported by the small business community. The small business survey asked this question of small business: `I think there should be some roll-back of GST.' Twenty-five per cent agreed with the question, and 65 per cent opposed it. Sixty-five to 25. I have seen some bad surveys on tax in my time, but I have never seen a three to one against GST. Sixty-five per cent opposed the Leader of the Opposition, who claims that in the name of small business he is going to roll back the GST. I think you owe it to the small business community of Australia to tell them where you are going to roll it back, when you are going to roll it back, how you are going to pay for it and what your new increased income tax rates are going to be. I think the small business community of Australia deserve some answers. We have heard this negative, carping, whingeing, opportunistic performance, which has been put on by a group of people who should know better for, I think, two or three years now. After the GST came in I was absolutely flabbergasted to hear, after all of that campaign, the Labor Party say - guess what? - that they were so opposed to the GST they were going to keep it. Absolutely staggering! But, not to do a 180 degree U-turn, the Labor Party said, `We'll be rolling it back.' Here we are eight weeks after the introduction of the GST and they are still to name one item, one amount, when or how it will be paid for.  The Leader of the Opposition said he was on an unchartered road to an unknown destination. This would be one of the laziest oppositions in federal history. It is hard to go back through the annals of federal history but, if you were to compare this opposition to the Hayden led opposition or to the Whitlam led opposition - both of which had policies - I think this would unquestionably be the laziest opposition in federal history. The opposition are now being led by two people who are second generation politicians and they are yet to come up with one policy. The small business community of Australia have figured out the Labor Party. Never a truer word was said than when the Leader of the Opposition said, `The Labor Party does not pretend to represent small business.' They do not pretend it and the small business community have figured that out. The one thing you cannot tell them about is roll-back and one thing you will never convince them about is this unchartered road to an unknown destination.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Batman for his question. The first point I note is that the member for Batman is plainly in every way in favour not of cheaper fuel but of more expensive fuel. We know that. The Labor Party want to abolish the $500 million that we put in to reduce the country-city differential. We know that. -  - Oh, that is simply a lie? Well, let us see a pronouncement from the Labor Party that they support our tax reductions on fuel. Let us see for the first time - because we have not seen it to date - that they have actually repudiated their view that our reductions on fuel excise are nothing more than a boost to pollution. - The Leader of the Opposition has forgotten that that is the member for Dickson's position, and it has never been repudiated. - It is quite simple: the member for Dickson's proposition that the reductions in fuel excise that we have put in place are a multibillion dollar boost to pollution. The other general issue that has to be clearly established is that, if there is anyone in this place, if there is anyone in Australia - and there are not many of them - who is hoping that prices for fuel stay high, it is the ALP. If there is anyone who is hoping that the high price of crude remains a difficulty it is the ALP.  - I refer to the comment I made earlier. In terms of the percentage of excise paid, for every dollar spent on fuel in this country on an average basis, in New South Wales in March 1996 it was 58.6 per cent and in August this year under us it is 47.2 per cent. Whether it was the extra $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion that the Labor Party want them to pay in excise on transport fuel, whether it is the $500 million or whether it is the GST rebate on business petrol, the simple reality is that, if people wanted to pay more for petrol in rural and regional Australia, they would do something that I do not believe they intend doing in a million years, and that is vote Labor. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I note that Woomera is in his electorate, and I share his concern for the constituents who live there about the events that have taken place and for any threat that they have felt and the concern that they obviously have about the events that have unfolded there over the last couple of days. The situation today is that, despite the threat to the physical presence of the detention staff and the extensive damage caused by 60 to 80 people who rioted yesterday, ACM and APS officers have managed to bring the situation under control. This afternoon it is quiet. Yesterday the measures used to subdue the rioters which included a water cannon - I might say that that is really the local airport fire service facility - and tear gas were entirely appropriate and necessary, given that some 30 officers received injuries, and some sufficiently serious to warrant treatment at the local hospital. When people take out fence posts and use them to manufacture spears and fashion makeshift catapults to propel rocks, they must be held accountable for their action. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable.Last night, 10 people were removed from the centre and taken to the Woomera lock-up. They will be transferred to appropriate facilities in Port Augusta and Adelaide. Today, detention centre staff have done a walk-through of the centre and have removed a further 17 people whom they believe were ringleaders, and they are in the process of identifying and locating others who were involved. Some 60 people from within the centre have sought to be voluntarily relocated because of concerns that they felt for their safety in view of the intimidation under which they had been placed by others. Some six buildings were destroyed, including the dining, recreation and educational facilities, as well as the ablution blocks. Of course, extensive damage occurred to the surrounding fences.The Australian Federal Police and the South Australian police are examining the burnt-out buildings to establish the cause of the fires. The department is assessing what new capital works may be required and whether or not people need to be relocated to other detention centres. Clearly, it is extremely difficult to provide meals to the 730 detainees when the facilities have been destroyed, and those matters are being addressed. I have asked the Federal Police and the South Australian police, in conjunction with my department, to investigate what charges can be laid. We are looking at videos taken of the incidents and we will use those to help in identification. Obviously, if the law is not adequate, I will come back to the House to ensure that appropriate penalties do exist for actions of this sort.Let me make it quite clear that these events will in no way persuade the government to grant detainees refugee status if they are not refugees. People who are found not to be refugees and who have no claim to be here must be removed as soon as practicable. Some people have attempted to justify what has happened here, and they have done so quite misleadingly by suggesting that people could be released when refugee status has been determined.  - One organisation that should know far better than most, because it is funded to have expertise in these matters, is the Refugee Council of Australia. Let me say that very deliberately; because they know, as this House has been informed, that some 1,700 people were determined to be refugees but that issues relating to security, character and health have not been satisfactorily addressed. I am not prepared, nor do I think anybody would ask me, to have released into the Australian community people where those issues have not been satisfactorily addressed. Those who suggest that there has been any effort on our part to keep people in detention and that that in some way justifies what has happened -   - Let me just be very clear: if any organisation - no matter how worthy they are - knowingly misrepresent the situation, that is to be addressed and I will continue to address it. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Let me just conclude by paying tribute to all the personnel who have been involved and acknowledging the strong cooperation between Commonwealth and state agencies and the highly professional way in which they have taken their duties under very considerable duress. No people engaged to carry out a responsibility of maintaining a facility should be subjected to danger to their life and limb and their person through actions of this sort. Let me make it abundantly clear that there is no way that we will be compromising the way in which these issues are addressed and no way that we will succumb to any duress by any organisation or by anybody misrepresenting or otherwise the situation in relation to these matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. This is a matter that has been in the news in recent weeks. If I may take a moment not only to answer the question asked by the member for Calare but also to explain the perspectives that the government brings to this matter, the government has purchased those tickets and it does have a box, and that is for the purpose of providing appropriate hospitality to guests of the Commonwealth. I think that is entirely appropriate given the importance of these games. I do not apologise in any way for what the government has done, and I do not think the member for Calare seeks me to do it. He asked me what the motives of companies are in offering hospitality. I would imagine that most companies that offer hospitality to anybody, be it a member of parliament or somebody else, would want the person receiving the hospitality to at least think not less favourably of the company but perhaps more favourably. That is self-evident, and I think all of us here are sufficiently seasoned and adult to understand that that is the case. For my part, I cannot see any real difference between somebody being offered a ticket and a place for advantageous viewing of a sporting event in a box at the Olympic Games and perhaps the AFL Grand Final. I might ask rhetorically how many members of this House on both sides might possibly be in corporate boxes at the AFL Grand Final. I do not know. Can I say that I offer no criticism of that. I do not see any difference in principle between somebody accepting hospitality from a corporate body at an AFL grand final, a cricket test, a rugby union international or a rugby league grand final and the Olympic Games. It depends a bit on your sporting tastes. Many of us would regard attending the Olympic Games as being the pinnacle. Others might regard attendance at one of those other fixtures as being far more important.  - I am interested that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects, `Not a 10-grand package.' I notice of course that the Leader of the Opposition has laid down I think some quite sensible guidelines as far as his own frontbench are concerned. I do not see a great deal of difference between the approach that is being taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the approach that is being taken by the government. As far as the government is concerned, there are a couple of rules that are clear. The first is that any hospitality that is accepted must be declared so that people are aware of it. Secondly, the government has decided that in accepting any hospitality no member of the government should accept overnight accommodation from a corporate sponsor and, given that there are certain travel entitlements, that therefore the extent of the hospitality that will be extended by the corporates will be the value of the tickets and the value of any hospitality that may accompany them. In that sense, they will be in exactly the same position as somebody who accents hospitality at a football match or at a cricket fixture.We have discussed this matter. It is not easy. On the one hand, it is possible to use the sort of extravagant interjection of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is easy to fling around allegations about $10,000 packages. We will have in this country in the next few weeks probably the largest gathering of senior company executives that has ever been in this country across a whole range of responsibilities of the government. For this government and its senior members to pass up the opportunity of meeting those people and advancing the interests of this country would be absolutely ridiculous. I think the rules that have been set by this government are sensible. They strike a balance between avoiding the impression of accepting too much from individual companies and, equally, not passing up the opportunity of talking to people who have a significant capacity to invest in the economic future of this country.I have to say I find absurd the proposition that any member of this parliament of any political persuasion will be influenced in his or her decision by the acceptance of some hospitality at a sporting event. It has been going on for time immemorial. The Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister accepted hospitality. The member for Kingsford-Smith when he was a minister accepted hospitality. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister accepted hospitality. Let us have an end to this humbug from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and appreciate his interest in East Timor. Tomorrow is indeed the first anniversary of the ballot being held under United Nations supervision for independence in East Timor, and it is with great pleasure that I will be representing the Australian government at ceremonies in East Timor tomorrow. There is no doubt that this government and this country are committed to assisting East Timor in the transition to independence, and I will be repeating that message very strongly tomorrow when I meet the East Timorese leadership. Members may be interested to know that, over the last year, Australian assistance has helped to reopen 750 schools. We have provided seeds and tools for over 30,000 farming families, we have provided clean water to more than 100,000 people, we have helped to deliver 17,000 housing and roofing kits, and we are working with community groups on employment generation and community based projects. The House may also be interested to know that the Department of Finance and Administration, which has done such a magnificent job in managing our own financial outlays over the last 4½ years, will be helping East Timor to establish and to manage a national budget. We will also continue to help with security. There are over 1,500 members of the Australian Defence Force deployed in East Timor with the peacekeeping operation, and most of those are in the most dangerous part of East Timor, that is, the western region. There are also 80 Australian police within the United Nations civilian police.  It is important, both while I am in East Timor and for ministers visiting Jakarta now and in the next weeks, and I think the Treasurer will be in Jakarta fairly soon - next week, I am told - for us to continue to remind people in East Timor, as well as in Indonesia, that we are deeply concerned about militia activity, in particular across the border; that Indonesia is responsible for security on its side of the border and it is responsible for the disarming of the militias; and that we look to the Indonesian government to fulfil those obligations and also to continue the work it is doing in cooperation with the UN and countries like ours to move towards the disbandment of the refugee camps and get the refugees repatriated to East Timor or to remain in Indonesia with regard to their wishes.Let me finally say that the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, under the leadership of Sergio de Mello, has done an extremely good and proficient job in a difficult circumstance. Of course there have been criticisms from time to time that are picked up in the media and displayed in newspapers and the like, but this is a difficult task and it is being done with great dedication, great enthusiasm and great professionalism by the United Nations. We, for our part, are proud to have been able to help them and very much appreciate the excellent job they have done.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I am aware of the report of the chief scientist and I am also aware of the ABS figures that were released this morning. They have shown a decline in expenditure on R&amp;D, and that is a matter that requires study by the government to understand the reasons for it. It is an issue to which, in response to the recommendations of the innovation summit, the government will be directing its attention. It would, however, I think, be a little simplistic to imagine that you can turn that around simply by, as is being alleged by those who sit opposite, restoration of the programs that existed under the former government. Some of those programs were good; some of them were bad. Some of those programs encouraged rorts, particularly syndication, and the abolition of those rorts by the government was totally justified. It would be equally simplistic to suggest that a restoration of the tax concession from 125 to 150 per cent would automatically change things overnight.There are a number of reasons. There has been a significant decline in the investment in R&amp;D by the mining sector. That is in part a function of the change in commodity prices. I note that, even in the United Kingdom, which seems to provide many of the ideas for the present opposition, there has been a sustained fall in gross expenditure on research and development over recent years. The Leader of the Opposition expresses the aspiration that Australia should have a secure, sound and optimistic economic future. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, over the last 4½ years, we have seen this country grow at a stronger rate and in a more evenly based, sustained fashion than it has for 30 years. If the Leader of the Opposition seeks to compare this country with Austria, Iceland or indeed any of the other countries that he seeks to compare us with, I am very happy for that comparison to take place. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to get into the business of economic comparisons, I would remind him of the outstanding productivity growths that have occurred under this government, I would remind him of the fact that we have 810,000 more Australians in work than when he gave up the treasury bench in March of 1996, and I would remind him of the much lower inflation, of the lower interest rates, of the high levels of business investment and of the fact that this country successfully stared down the biggest economic decline that the Asia-Pacific region has had in 30 years. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to get into the business of economic comparison, I am more than happy to indulge him over the next 14 months. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I share, as I am sure other members from Victoria also share, his concerns about the damage being wrought by the AMWU and other unions in Victoria. The likely impact is very significant - tens of millions of dollars in lost production, We are not sure yet from the early reports how many people have actually supported the AMWU's campaign. They say 20,000. The employer groups say 10,000. Whichever it is, it is a lot of workers taking industrial action and it obviously involves millions of dollars of lost wages, millions of dollars of lost exports and, just as seriously, the loss of reputation for the state of Victoria's manufacturing sector, particularly at a time when, for example, Holden are looking for a new plant. I think it was someone from Holden who said, `Well, this is a plant that's there to be lost.' In other words, it is an opportunity but an opportunity to be lost if Victoria continues to undermine its reputation as a reliable supplier.This is a campaign run by the unions basically to knock off enterprise bargaining. Enterprise bargaining is a system introduced by the Labor Party, tentatively, in the early 1990s which had our support. As a government in 1996 and since, we have gone further in the encouragement of enterprise bargaining. It works. There are more people with jobs today, people who have got jobs have got higher wages, productivity is up and the level of industrial disputes under this better system has reached all-time record lows. This is a better system, in everybody's interests, which even the Labor Party when they were in office said was a good idea and we should promote. Now, sadly, we have a group of militant trade unionists in Victoria who are setting out to destroy a system which has provided benefits for workers. They are simply manipulating the system to allow for industry agreements. Not even the Labor Party in office were in favour of industry wide strikes. Yet now, because the AMWU is one of the biggest donors to the Labor Party, the Labor Party's policy has changed. Complemented by a policy to also abolish the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, the Labor Party's policy in action can be seen in the state of Victoria today. If ever they were on this side of the House, what you would see Australia wide is exactly what you are seeing in Victoria today - more strikes, lower productivity, lower wages and fewer jobs for the hard working workers who, in my view, deserve a lot better.The Labor Party are saying there should be a process of mediation. When we put up a proposal for mediation, the Labor Party voted against it. They say that this dispute would not occur if the Industrial Relations Commission had more power. Yet, when that very bill to give more power to the Industrial Relations Commission is in the Senate this week, the Labor Party will vote against it. Lastly, the people who are dudded by these left-wing militant union leaders are the very workers they claim to represent. This week there will be an opportunity for the Labor Party to vote for the workers to give them a right to have a say in a secret ballot as to whether or not they support industrial action. What will the Labor Party do? They will vote against the rights of workers. What is happening in Victoria today is the Labor Party's policy in action and it demonstrates for all to see why this lot on the opposition benches, run by the trade union movement, should never be given the opportunity to change Australia's workplace relations system. </DOC>

 - This attempt by the Labor Party to open up some kind of `envy' campaign in relation to independent schools ought to be very strongly condemned. I stand by the statements that I made last week and remind the member for Dobell that the new schools policy of the government has been endorsed not only by bodies such as the Australian Parents Council and the National Association of Independent Schools but also by the National Catholic Education Commission, which represents all of the systemic schools within the Catholic system. The reason that the policy has been endorsed by all of those bodies is that, over the time we have been in government, we have acted to bring in the new SES system for calculating the entitlement of independent schools. The new SES system takes greater account of the socioeconomic capacity of parents and is not as hidebound by historic factors that have worked against many independent schools, particularly those in rural and regional areas which at one stage of their history may have been better endowed, and their parents may have been better endowed, than the ravages of changes in economic circumstances have now produced. It is also supported by those bodies because one of the very important undertakings that I made on behalf of the coalition to the National Catholic Education Commission before the 1998 election was in relation to raising all Catholic schools in the systemic system to category 11. That was very widely welcomed by the Catholic education system.The member for Dobell will know that among the poorer resourced independent schools within the Australian education system are, in fact, many of the Catholic systemic schools. The member for Dobell does not seek to have this debate across the totality of what the government has done in relation to independent schools but seeks to rely upon one narrow aspect of what the government has done. I am unconditionally proud of what the government has done to advance freedom of choice and, in the words of the head of the independent Christian schools association, `freedom of choice to send your child to an independent school is now a reality for working-class people in Australia'. That has been made possible by the policies of this government. The member for Dobell - no doubt getting his riding instructions from the Australian Education Union - has attempted to introduce the sort of divisive argument which I thought we had put behind us. The reality is that, as is their right, there are many well-off parents in Australia who choose to send their children to government schools. One of the more irrelevant and I thought foolish interventions in this debate was made by the headmaster of an independent school in Victoria who suggested that those people should be charged fees. Just as well-off people have a right to send their children to government schools, it is equally the case that not so well-off people should be able to aspire to send their children to independent schools. The thing that has made that possible, far more than anything else, has been the abolition of the new schools policy retained by the Australian Labor Party. What the abolition of the new schools policy has produced is a capacity on the part of, say, the Sydney Anglican community to begin building an Anglican system in the western suburbs of Sydney where they will offer parents the opportunity of sending their children to independent schools for fees of $2,000, $3,000 and $4,000 a year. It was only possible to bring in that new policy because we got the legislation through the Senate with the help of Senator Harradine. It was voted against by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party voted to stop the expansion of the Anglican system and systems like it within the western suburbs of Sydney. Their blind ideology on this would seek to preserve an education system essentially built around the government structure, which has made a great contribution to the education of Australian children, and what you might loosely call the established or traditional independent structure and the Catholic systemic system, without allowing for the expansion of a new stream in the independent school area which increasingly is available to parents on more modest incomes.We stand unarguably for freedom of choice. We reject the old shibboleths in this debate. We want working-class families to have the opportunity to send their children to independent schools and we also recognise the sacrifices that many Australian parents make to send their children to independent schools. I am proud of our education policies in this area and I totally reject the old-fashioned class humbug of the Australian Education Union. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last Wednesday the Leader of the Opposition was up in Townsville in the electorate of Herbert. While this might seem to be a futile exercise given the extraordinarily good representation the people of Herbert get, these comments really cannot go unchallenged. To give some idea of the doublethink of the Leader of the Opposition, immediately after describing Lifetime Health Cover as a sham, he attempted to go on by saying:Don't get me wrong, I actually happen to believe in private health insurance.This is fascinating for a person who sat in a government that ended the government contribution to the reinsurance pool, removed the Commonwealth bed day subsidy -  - and reduced Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, thereby increasing the cost of private health insurance by 37 per cent over and above what it would be otherwise. It is very interesting that he can pretend to support the private health insurance industry when as Minister for Finance he oversaw an industry with a $120 million loss in one year, when a quarter of the funds were under prudential requirements. But what he is describing as a scam is in fact a piece of legislation that the Labor Party supported. I think there is only one reason that you can explain this sort of doublethink, and that is we believe that the Leader of the Opposition would secretly like to support private health insurance, like John Della Bosca, like Graham Richardson, like Bob Carr and like Peter Beattie, but the fact is that he is not strong enough to stand up to the left wing in the Labor Party and he gets pushed around, not able to stand up for what he believes. If you want to look at public hospitals, Mr Speaker, it is very simple. We believe that up to 400,000 extra procedures will be done as the result of nearly two million people coming into private health insurance. These procedures will either be done in private hospitals, which means that that frees up a bed in a public hospital, or be done as a private patient in a public hospital, which will provide a new source of revenue to the public hospitals themselves. The Labor Party interject about Medicare, and of course they basked in smug complacency over Medicare. Their Medicare did not immunise Australian children, did not meet the needs of rural Australia, did not meet the needs of people with a mental illness and did not meet the needs of indigenous Australians. All this inconsistency is very easy to understand and explain. They want to roll back the 30 per cent rebate. They do not want private health insurance. They have not invented the system and they do not support it, and it will lead to some very simple things: increased premiums, particularly for older Australians, and more pressure on our public hospitals, and Australians will lose choice.</DOC>

 - I do remember saying that and it is the case that the facility that I opened at that particular school, which has produced some students on both sides of Australian politics -  - I won't get into personalities -  - The member for Melbourne interjects about no argument. The member for Dobell asks if I take account of the fundraising capacities of different schools. The answer is yes, and that is why schools in category 1 get on average about 17 per cent per capita funding and schools in the Catholic systems get about 70 per cent. This shows the absolute ignorance of the Labor Party's education spokesman about the fundamentals of education funding in this country. The whole fundamental in education funding in this country is that the main per capita recurrent support from the Commonwealth operates on the basis that the poorest schools get the most funding and the not so poor schools get less funding. That is why the school in category 1 or 2 gets about 17 per cent, the sorts of schools that the member for Dobell was yelling his head off about get about 17 per cent, schools like Melbourne Grammar, and the Catholic systemic schools get 70 per cent. That is how it has been for a long time, and I think that is very fair. That is the system that I thought the Australian Labor Party supported. But what you cannot grasp is that there is another category of schools. The other category of schools is those low fee independent schools, and you voted to stop them expanding. When the bill came before the parliament to abolish the new schools policy that you maintained, you all voted to maintain the old system. The old system would have prevented the establishment of Anglican systemic schools in the western suburbs of Sydney charging fees of $2,000, $3,000 or $4,000 a year. These are the schools that John Aquilina is now wanting to run the ruler over in New South Wales because he has been sooled onto them by the teacher unions in that particular state. That is what you are trying to stop, and no attempt to drag Melbourne Grammar into it is going to alter that reality. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in aviation matters. The launch of Virgin Blue is a very clear demonstration of how the government has transformed the environment in the Australian airline industry. For the first time, new entrants like Impulse and Virgin Blue have a real chance to operate successfully. Labor talked a good game about opening up our skies and increasing competition, but it was all hot air. It did not happen; it went nowhere. We are now entering a new era of affordable airline travel, and it took this government to deliver it.Over the weekend, the member for Batman claimed - I do not know on what basis - that the Labor Party had opened up Australia's skies. The fact is that Labor did a good job of talking about increasing competition in the airline industry but it all went nowhere. In contrast, this government leased the major airports, with the result that their operators now have a financial incentive -  -  - They do. They have a financial incentive to provide adequate terminal facilities. This government also changed the foreign ownership rules and made it easier and simpler for Virgin Blue to start operations in this country - indeed, their first flight will be on Thursday of this week. It would have been a bureaucratic impossibility under Labor. It was this government that created an economic and business environment where investment for new entrants became attractive. That increased competition will create jobs, and it will reduce prices for the travelling public. It is worth noting that the cost of economy airfares in recent years, in real terms, has been rising, not falling. In the case of up-market airfares, it has been rising even more rapidly. We will see reduced prices for the travelling public and we will see a boost to our tourism industry - now our biggest export earner.Virgin Blue now employs about 300 people. Impulse has put on an extra 350 staff, including 110 staff at its Newcastle reservations centre, and it is continuing to recruit new staff. We are seeing a very interesting development indeed. It could even be said that, during the term of one narrow window of opportunity, it was possible for people to purchase an airfare from city to city that was cheaper than the cost of a taxi to go to the airport. We have achieved all of this without cutting any corners on safety. Impulse and Virgin Blue have been through a very rigorous approval process that involved 14 CASA staff working full-time for seven months. Both operators are safe; both have earned their right to fly.Whilst some have claimed that increased competition on the eastern routes might somehow affect regional Australia, I have to say that the east coast sees some of the busiest sectors in this country - indeed, in the world. I think Sydney to Melbourne is the third or fourth busiest sector in the world today, and it can well sustain competition from four airlines. The airlines have heard from me regularly about the importance of maintaining and improving their services in regional Australia, and the fact remains that our policies have transformed Australia's airline industry to the great benefit of everyone. At the same time, we are reforming the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in a measured and responsible way. We have introduced the best and most advanced traffic control system in the world, and these reforms are of benefit to the broader economy, to the tourism industry, to regional Australia and to the travelling public. </DOC>

 - The government school funding policies have introduced a new level of fairness, equity and social justice into schools funding. The vast proportion of the funding that will flow to schools under the government's policies over the next year and over the next quadrennium will go to the neediest schools. Under the new SES funding policy, the neediest schools could be said to be the schools below the SES score of 100. That score is slightly above the score of the Catholic parish schools, which is around 96. Those schools will receive some 76 per cent of the total funding over the next year and over the next four years.The next critical point is this: the schools serving the wealthiest families in Australia will receive essentially no funding increase. Those schools will be funded at an equivalent to 13.7 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost, and that is essentially the funding level that those schools get under the present system - there is no increase. From there through to the neediest schools there is a progression in funding according to need. - The figures that were used in this question are the figures that have been peddled in the Senate by Senator Carr. - They are not the figures given by my department. - They are the figures peddled in the Senate by Senator Carr. Senator Carr has been circulating figures suggesting that some schools that people would regard as wealthy schools will be getting funding increases of a million dollars or more.  - Let me make it quite clear that these figures of Senator Carr's are grossly inaccurate - wildly inaccurate - on all the preliminary assessments that we have done of the real figures coming in from the schools, and indeed in a number of cases they are out by more than a million dollars. The category 1 schools have been shown by the application of the SES measure - and this is very important; listen to this - to range in SES score from 93 to 130. That is from very needy schools, which have been trapped in categories by your grossly inadequate and unfair funding policies, up to the schools serving the wealthiest families. So your characterisation of those schools as the wealthiest schools in Australia is totally fallacious and has been shown to be fallacious by a fair funding model which has been supported by Australia's leading experts in equity indexes, by the Catholic school system and by public trials and public evaluations. The sooner you stop trying to divide this community and misleading people and telling falsehoods about the funding situation the more respect the Labor Party will have, because at the moment it has absolutely none. These figures that you quote attempting to demonstrate injustice are totally fallacious. - You will see, when the SES scores are released for these schools, that yours are totally fallacious and that the schools are being funded quite clearly according to the relative need of the parents. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question, and I note his keen interest in native title issues. Members will recall that last August the Senate disallowed the Northern Territory's proposed alternative native title regimes relating to petroleum, mining and land acquisition. I am informed that the backlog of mining applications in the Northern Territory now exceeds 1,000. The Northern Territory has amended its legislation a number of times since it was first introduced to ensure its workability. In fact, it amended it after I made the determinations in relation to the basic legislation in April last year but before it was disallowed by the Senate. I received a request last week from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to make three determinations that the new Northern Territory regimes comply with the Native Title Act, and I am presently considering that legislation.The question of whether there are alternative policies on native title continues to be an issue. Tomorrow, I understand, the Senate will debate 13 disallowance motions on the 13 determinations I made in relation to the Queensland alternative native title regimes. From media reports today it remains unclear whether the Labor Party have a policy to support their Queensland colleagues and allow the legislation to stand or to disallow it. In fact, it appears that, while Labor are facing the potential embarrassment of disallowing Queensland Labor's laws, there seems to be something of a split within the ranks. The Financial Review reported today that the federal shadow cabinet is deeply divided over the issue and it seems that the Leader of the Opposition has been personally in contact with Premier Beattie on a possible compromise. In fact, I am told he delayed shadow cabinet yesterday for the purpose of dealing with the issue. At the same time the Courier-Mail reported today that the shadow Aboriginal affairs spokesperson is threatening to resign from shadow cabinet over the proposal. -  - The member for Banks told the Financial Review that federal Labor should disallow the Queensland regime. The question continues to be what will federal Labor do, and it continues to be a question without an answer. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have backed himself into a corner. On the one hand he has told the Queensland indigenous groups that the opposition will reject the laws and guarantee the right to negotiate on mining tenements; on the other hand he is doing slick deals with the Queensland Premier against the opposition of the member for Banks. The people of Queensland still have to put up with this indecision, and that indecision comes at considerable cost. The Queensland Mining Council has estimated that over $300 million worth of mineral exploration has been lost in Queensland over the impasse. Premier Beattie has warned of a meltdown in Queensland over this issue and he has been pleading with his federal counterparts over the matter for months. The federal Labor Party must stop bickering and get on and make a decision.Opposition members - Oh! -  - It is long past the time for the Leader of the Opposition to show leadership on this issue.</DOC>

I would not make any personal accusation against the opposition that might imply that they are supporting this legislation for any particular reason.

 - In accordance with the time honoured custom of the government, we will check whether what has been put to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is in fact an accurate excerpt from that speech that I made. Let me simply say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the measure of a country's capacity to handle debt is, of course, ultimately the strength and durability of its economy. Australia's net debt servicing ratio - that is, the net debt interest payments as a proportion of total exports - fell to 9.8 per cent in the March quarter. This fall occurred despite increasing world interest rates and indicates a strong capacity to service our foreign debt. Under the coalition the debt servicing ratio has averaged 10.3 per cent compared with an average of 14 per cent under Labor. The debt servicing ratio today is a far cry from the peak of 20 per cent recorded in the September quarter of 1990. It was 20 per cent and it is now 10.3 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me about debt. When it comes to debt, the Labor Party are the debt experts. In five budgets the Leader of the Opposition ran up something like $90 billion of government debt.  - Let me simply make the observation that you narrow cast a question when you fear the broadcast. The broadcast out of this is that the Leader of the Opposition was the debt expert of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition ran up billions and billions of dollars of debt, and it has taken 4½ years of effort by the coalition to wind it back. I would have thought that the last issue that the Labor Party would have the gall to ask a question on would be the question of debt. Not only did they run up about $90 billion of debt but to compound that fiscal crime they have spent 4½ years trying to stop us cleaning up the mess they left us. I would simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: your performance as a finance minister was equally as bad as your performance as an employment minister. You left us with $90 billion of debt and you took unemployment to a post Depression high of 11.2 per cent. That is not a bad double.</DOC>

 - I have seen a number of responses to the announcement that was made yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. That announcement was an entirely measured, reasonable and appropriate response to the need for a reform of the operation of the committee system of the United Nations. It does not represent, as some have suggested, a turning away by Australia from the principles of the United Nations, but it does represent a determination by this government to ensure that matters affecting Australia are resolved by Australians within Australia. Our objection is not to the principles underlying the convenants into which this country has entered but to the operation of the committee system. There has been a suggestion in some of the reporting that the decisions taken by the government represent a response which has put Australia at odds with the rest of the world. For example, on the AM program this morning it was suggested that Australia was the only developed country not to have signed up to the optional protocol to the convention on discrimination against women. That claim was wrong. To date, only 43 states have signed the optional protocol, only five have ratified, and a further five need to ratify to bring it into force. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom have signed the optional protocol. In fact, the United States has not even ratified the parent treaty after eight years of a Democrat administration - the United States has still not ratified the parent treaty of the optional protocol - and we are now criticised for indicating that Australia will not adhere to it.  The decisions that were announced yesterday give effect to the concerns that we have that the committee system is not operating satisfactorily. We are concerned, for example, that in its most recent report on Australia the CERD committee - the one dealing with the elimination of racial discrimination - singled Australia out with 13 of the 15 recommendations labelled as concerns. This was higher than the number of concerns listed for China - 10; Pakistan - nine; and substantially higher than that listed for Cuba - one. The point of that comparison is I think blindingly obvious to all Australians, and that is that when it comes to basic freedoms and democratic institutions Australia is significantly ahead of those other three countries, to put it mildly. We are not dealing here with any argument as to whether this country opposes arbitrary arrest and detention or whether this country opposes the persecution of people according to their religious or political beliefs. Patently we do not. What we are dealing with is an unbalanced committee procedure. I am also rejecting the claim made that the decisions that have been taken by the government put us at odds with the attitude and the conduct of other countries with which it is reasonable to make comparisons. As a result of the implementation of the announcements made yesterday by my three colleagues, Australia will still be subject to as much scrutiny as the United Kingdom and to far more scrutiny than the United States. It is interesting, when you look at the matrix of Western states adhering to the six principal human rights treaties, that Australia is an adherent to all of them. As you go down the list, you find that the United States of course has not ratified a number of them. You find that Ireland has signed but not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and Ireland has signed but not ratified the convention against torture. The point I simply make is that the government's response is based on its belief that once a matter has been resolved through the Australian political process the notion that those whose point of view has been rejected through the democratic Australian political process in effect have a second go through a United Nations committee is simply not something that we support. We believe that Australians should resolve matters affecting Australia within this country. Australian institutions are as robustly democratic as any in the world, and more open and transparent than most. This country does not embrace any of the things that are odious to the universal operation of human rights, and I regard the announcement made by the foreign minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs yesterday as completely fulfilling the commitment I made when this government was elected, that is, that we would propound the values and the interests of this country. I believe that that announcement yesterday is all of a piece with that, and it is an announcement that gives effect to a very measured, reasonable and considered examination of an unsatisfactory operation of the United Nations committee system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Like everyone in this place, I regret the very high fuel price that people are paying today at bowsers. The Prime Minister has expressed that regret. None of us enjoy it. I make again the obvious and truthful point that the opposition never allude to: the answer to cheaper bowser prices is a better supply of crude oil internationally. Plainly, the objective of the opposition here - despite their unbelievable record and utter hypocrisy in relation to fuel excise - is to try and depict country motorists as being disadvantaged, despite the fact that they overwhelmingly benefit from the very real reductions in excise on transport and from the rebating of GST on petrol used in business.Let me make this very important point. I have actually had a bit of a look around today at some of the very high spikes that you get. I find that they are not confined to any one area in Australia. In fact, at Coonabarabran today, which was raised in this place, the price of petrol has reached 111c whereas just down the road at the neighbouring town it is around $1 while in Mossman today you could pay up to $1.08. So there is some real volatility out there. Frankly, I am concerned enough about some of this volatility to have written today to Professor Fels about what is happening in Coonabarabran, after having listened to some of the concerns of that community and the relative spike in that place. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in relation to country-city fuel prices is underlined quite simply by the fact that the $500 million that we have put in to close the gap - which, as I indicated yesterday, has overwhelmingly across Australia helped to close the country-city gap between June and July of this year - the opposition intend to abolish. Open and shut. You are no friends of country motorists.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I can inform the House that the current account deficit for the June quarter was $7.9 billion, or in terms of the March quarter at GDP around 4.9 per cent. For the year the government had forecast a current account deficit of $33½ billion; the outcome was $33.7 billion - an extraordinarily accurate forecast when you are thinking of those sorts of numbers. As it turned out, the outcome was below the current account deficit as forecast in percentage terms because the economy grew stronger than was forecast at budget time.  The June quarter, which was an improvement over the previous year, reflected a continued growth in Australia's exports from continuing recovery in the world economy, particularly in Asia. The volume of exports grew 1.5 per cent in the June quarter and in year average terms exports have grown nine per cent in 1999-2000 due to a stronger world economy and no doubt due to the efforts of previous Australian trade ministers who have promoted Australia's products overseas in such a formidable way in the last three years. Elaborately transformed manufactured exports rose 0.7 per cent in the quarter, non-rural commodities rose three per cent in the quarter and service exports rose 2.5 per cent in the quarter, whereas the volume of exports grew only slightly at 0.2 per cent. Net exports are expected to contribute to GDP in the June quarter, which has not been the case previously. I can inform the honourable member that the government is forecasting a continued improvement in the current account deficit in 2000-01 as exports continue to rebound very strongly off the Asian financial crisis and the strengthening world economy. Although we cannot afford to be complacent about the current account, the fact that it has improved and our exports are growing as strongly as they are is improving Australia's trade position with it actually contributing to growth. The flip side of that, of course, are the net foreign debt figures. The Prime Minister has already referred to those. I can report to the House that the good news from net foreign debt is that, whereas government debt contributed 17 per cent of net foreign debt when this government was elected, it is down today to 10 per cent. That is because this government has not borrowed in net terms a single dollar since it was elected. One can imagine that, if this government had followed the example of its predecessors and run up $80 billion of debt in five budgets, it would have added another $80 billion, all other things being equal, to net foreign debt. If we had had a record of $80 billion worth of deficits borrowed by the government - the record of our predecessor - then, all other things being equal, it would have amounted to another $80 billion. The Labor Party, of course, knows this to be the case. I pulled out a question from June of 1995 asked by the current Prime Minister of the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley. When Australia's current account deficit was six per cent in June of 1995, the now Prime Minister asked the then Minister for Finance what the government strategy was to deal with the current account deficit. As it was reported, the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, said this in the House of Representatives on 21 June 1995:You have asked for our approach. Absolutely, we will give you our approach. Our approach is to produce budget surpluses ... In June of 1995, his budget surplus was minus $13,000 million and the next year, by producing a budget surplus, he produced a deficit of $10,000 million. They knew the talk. The talk was that the budget should have been in surplus. What they could not do was act. He had a record of two budgets with a cumulative deficit of $23 billion of borrowing. The good news is that we put aside the Labor Party's wanton waste and we put aside the $80 billion debt racked up. This government has not borrowed, in net terms, since it was elected, and we have now paid back $50 billion of the $80 billion Labor debt. We intend to continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the remarks referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but the general point he raises concerns the question of petrol excise. That has been the subject of quite a number of questions in the House. I have stated the government's position. That position remains absolutely, completely and totally as I have stated it in this place over the past few days. There is no change in the government's policy. We will not be embracing the opportunism of the opposition. We will not be running down the surplus. We will not be cutting into necessary spending in education, roads and all the other things, which would be necessary to fund either a cut or a freeze in excise. That is not a solution to the problem. The solution lies in bringing the spiralling world oil price under control and, hopefully, bringing it down. The government is bending its efforts responsibly in that direction, and in no other direction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I might let the member for Grey and other members of the House know that the advice that I gave previously that there had been several officers injured and requiring stitches understated the severity of some of the injuries suffered by both ACM and APS personnel. What I will report will give concern, I am sure, to all members.One ACM officer of Aboriginal descent was dragged inside the external fence by detainees as he sought to prevent detainees from breaching the fence. While he was on the ground, he was repeatedly hit by detainees, using posts that they had pulled from the ground that had been used for the courtesy fence. He suffered a number of blows to the back of his neck and suffered injuries as a result. Another was hit by a large rock thrown by detainees such that he suffered a head injury that required several stitches. In relation to APS staff, another person who had what appeared to be superficial injuries was later found to be suffering internal bleeding, which is the subject of ongoing investigation, and another has a broken ankle and has been transferred to Adelaide for further medical attention.The seriousness of these matters ought not in any way be understated. I regret very much that there are some people who do not understand the lawful basis on which these issues are dealt with. The fact is that detention of unauthorised arrivals is required by act of parliament. These provisions were passed by the parliament and supported by both sides of this House. Detention of unauthorised arrivals is necessary for the following purposes: to establish a person's identity, and that is necessary because many have disposed of documents that would enable that to happen before they come to Australia; to carry out security, character and health checks; to have them available during the assessment of their claims; and to facilitate their removal if they have no lawful basis to be in Australia. There are some people - amongst them perhaps not practising journalists but certainly their editorialists - who have picked up the line regrettably used by my friend the shadow minister that in some way we hold people in detention longer than is necessary. Let me make it very clear: it is not in the government's interests to hold people in detention, at very considerable expense to taxpayers, when the decision making can be carried out with efficacy and quickly.Opposition member - You're intense. - I am intense, yes, because it is a very serious issue. When some people are narrowcasting -  -  - Don't blame us. -  - Let me continue with the point I was making. It is not in the government's interests to keep people in detention longer than is necessary. Around June, I made a number of statements about the prospect that a significant number of people would be released from detention. It was because the primary issue of whether or not they were refugees had been addressed and they had been found, prima facie, to engage our protection obligations. The remaining issues that needed to be addressed related to character, security and health. That ought to be understood. If you are going to address the security issue before a person is released, that is the issue, along with character and health, that is keeping people in detention, not the question of establishing whether or not their claims for refugee status are bona fide. To suggest that there is any reason for delay or to suggest that people ought to be released is saying that people who are a risk to security should be released. It is saying that people who may have been criminals in the country from which they have come or the country which they transited en route to Australia should be released, or people who have a contagious disease that could impact upon the Australian community should be released.Let me make it very clear. These are substantial issues. We are not keeping people in detention longer than is necessary. Finally, let me quote from a magistrate who had to deal with some issues recently in relation to the very question of people escaping from detention and their expectations about being released. He commented:Defendants need to realise that they came to Australia illegally. They had to accept that if large groups of people come to Australia as they had done, the process will take a long time. Australia must make sure they are processed in accordance with Australian law. I am sure the authorities are doing whatever they can to speed that process. They all need to understand that in Australia they are subject to Australian law.</DOC>

 - Imagine the Labor Party talking about telecommunications in regional areas. Does `analog mobile phone network' ring a bell? All of the skill and judgment which the member for Dobell brought to that issue as minister he is now bringing to education. We had to completely fix up what would have been an entirely absent mobile phone network throughout regional Australia. You have no credibility whatsoever on this issue.  I am not going to accept the figures rattled off by the shadow minister. All that needs to be said is that the government's share of the Telstra dividend will be taken into consolidated revenue and we will consider our priorities in the run-up to the next budget. It is worth noting that the government has directed the money from the first two tranches of the Telstra sale into Networking the Nation, which the Labor Party opposed. That has installed a new and improved infrastructure the length and breadth of Australia and at the same time spent the money on the Natural Heritage Trust to the concrete and material benefit of regional Australia. Both those programs were opposed by the Labor Party from start to finish and they still oppose them. Your words ring very hollow. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and I pay tribute to him as somebody who has worked on petrol issues and has a thorough understanding of the petroleum industry in Australia because of all his efforts. I saw a report in a newspaper this morning comparing the prices in Melbourne and Wodonga, working off a base price in Melbourne of 95.2c and an excise of 38.1c, claiming that with a GST of 8.7 per cent the tax was 46.8c whereas in Wodonga, working off a base price of 99.9c and an excise of 38.1c, a GST of 9.1 per cent, the tax take was 47.2c -  - A difference, as the parrot on the frontbench interjects, of 0.4c. What the analysis does not take into account is the fuel grants scheme. The fuel grants scheme appears to be totally lacking from this analysis -  - Working off those figures, as I said, the tax take, so it is claimed, was 0.4c more in Wodonga than it was in Melbourne. But the analysis completely omits the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. There is a grant paid in respect of Wodonga of 1c a litre which is not available in Melbourne. Once you take that into account, the amount paid to the government, which is tax net of grant, is actually less in Wodonga than it is in Melbourne. The amount paid to the government of tax net of grants is actually less in Wodonga than it is in Melbourne. That is the same in respect of all of the other country towns which were mentioned in that report: Sale, Ouyen, Mildura, Hamilton, Geelong, Echuca, Bendigo and Ballarat, where in fact, according to the analysis, the pump price was less than in Melbourne in any event. It is just not a correct analysis to say we are only going to look at that aspect of tax which is paid to the government without looking at the grant which is paid back to the government in respect of the person concerned.It is quite clear from that analysis, as pointed out to me, that in Wodonga the tax net of grant paid to the government is less on that particular price than the person in Melbourne would be paying.  - This, of course, would not be the case if the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme were abolished. If the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme were abolished, it would be the case that you would be paying more in Wodonga on that price than in Melbourne. As far as I know, the only threat I have heard to the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme comes from the Australian Labor Party. There was a claim made in this parliament by the member for Hunter, who was interjecting not so long ago, that this scheme was not worth it and was not working. We have established a few things during this petrol debate. The first thing we have established is that the Labor Party supports indexation. We have established that. The second thing we have established is that the Labor Party, if it were ever elected, would keep GST on petrol. In other words, the Labor Party has no quibble with the government policy on excise and GST. The only area that the Labor Party has quibbled with the government on is the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, the $500 million which makes sure that if you are on a price like that in a town like that you actually pay less than you would on a price like that in a metropolitan centre. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was introduced to equalise that system back in regional Australia. On those figures, it is more than performing that task, and the threat to it comes not from this side but from the Labor Party, which, if it had its way, would drive up the price of petrol in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I will have a look at what Father Doyle put to the Senate committee. Even if the Leader of the Opposition has given an accurate representation of what Father Doyle said to the committee, it does not in any way gainsay what I said of Father Doyle's remarks yesterday. Father Doyle's remarks to which I referred yesterday were directed entirely towards the bill that is being criticised by the Labor Party. In the statement I referred to yesterday, Father Doyle strongly endorsed the funding allocations made to independent schools by this government.  - Mr Speaker, your exchange with those on the opposition front bench was in the context of government and non-government schools. Let me say something about the federal government's provision for government schools. In response to the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition, let me inform the parliament that over the next four years government schools will receive over $1.4 billion more from the Commonwealth than they received over the last four years. This year the amount of funding going to government schools is $2 billion - this is $402 million more for government schools than was the case in Labor's last year in office. It is a funding increase of 26 per cent. You have had a funding increase of 26 per cent over a period of four years, and over that same period the number of students attending government schools has increased by only 2.3 per cent. Of the $13 billion going to non-government schools over the next four years, $8.15 billion is going to Catholic schools, which altogether represents 63 per cent of the total. Throughout the whole of this debate, the Labor Party has sought to raise the spectre of this government unfairly supporting the so-called wealthy schools of Australia. - The question was about the government's funding mechanism for government schools, and I have been talking about the government's funding of government schools. The reality is that, despite what the Labor Party says, this government is spending more money on government schools than did Labor. This government has increased the funding for government schools at a faster rate than the population in government schools has gone up. What is more, the allegation made by the Labor Party that in some way we are enriching the children at so-called wealthy schools and those so-called wealthy schools is completely disproved by the fact that schools serving the wealthiest families in Australia will be funded at an equivalent to 13.7 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost. That recurrent cost is essentially the funding level that schools get under the present system, and the basis of the present system was established by earlier governments. This whole argument is designed to create the false impression in the Australian community that we are damaging government schools to help wealthy independent schools. That is completely wrong. If you consider that figure of 13.7 per cent, compared with 65 to 70 per cent for the poorer non-government schools, and if you consider the increase in funding by a factor of 26 per cent compared with a 2.3 per cent growth in student attendance at government schools, then you will see that that allegation falls completely to the ground. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. It is excellent to be able to tell the House some good news about native title, about the historic agreement on native title signed yesterday in Western Australia. The agreement is between the state, pastoralists, miners and native title holders and it formally recognises native title over an area of 50,000 square kilometres. It relates to something like 24 pastoral properties. I commend the parties for reaching agreement through a spirit of cooperation or, in the words of the President of the National Native Title Tribunal, `with an investment of perseverance and goodwill'. Federal Court Justice Madgwick said the consent agreement showed `what mature and resolute people, acting in good faith to reconcile difficult, indeed potentially inflammatory issues can do.'Mr Speaker, it would be good to see some maturity and good faith from the Labor Party in relation to native title. In fact, I am sure the Australian people would think it would be good to see anything from the Labor Party on native title, particularly what they propose to do in relation to the Queensland determination, which will be debated this afternoon in the Senate. The WA agreement was made possible by the government's 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act. It came after Aboriginal groups agreed to replace the right to negotiate over claimed land with the right to be consulted. This appears to be the very thing the opposition is saying is unacceptable to indigenous Australians. - This is what I assume has caused the opposition such a headache over the proposed Queensland schemes. The schemes should be allowed to come into operation as a package and not as some piecemeal deal designed to kowtow to interest groups while trying to save face with the Queensland Labor Party. The opposition leader said yesterday he was awaiting the outcome of last minute negotiations between the Beattie government and the Queensland Indigenous Working Group before committing the federal Labor Party to what is obviously an 11th hour position. He said:We will be there supportive of the Aborigines' position on a right to negotiate.He also said that Labor has no `in-principle objection' to state based regimes. We have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition this morning. - And we have not heard from the member for Banks either. -  - People are wondering if the member for Banks has been gagged. They are wondering whether he will, as has been speculated, resign from the shadow cabinet over the issue. - The Democrat spokes-man on indigenous affairs said this morning that the member for Banks is `bleeding profusely' at the moment. He said whether or not that is terminal is `something he'll have to decide'. This is from the Democrats, who are still pondering their Senate colleagues' position. The Democrats leader said this morning:We're running out of time on the floor of the Senate. We have to deal with the Queensland native title legislation before we go home tonight, and we still do not know what the Labor Party's doing.The question is whether the Labor Party knows that the Labor Party is doing. Premier Beattie is trying to broker a compromise. At absolute best the outcome looks like being a second rate deal that will not solve the problems of the Queensland residents. Reports in Queensland suggest that exploration expenditure to the value of some $300 million has been lost as a result of the impasse. The member for Groom will not be pleased to see that the Labor Party is shortchanging Queenslanders.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. Last night I was intrigued to receive a copy of a speech to the Sydney Institute delivered by the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow. I know it might disappoint a few of my colleagues to say this but in that speech the President of the ACTU made some good points. -  - I know it is hard to believe, but it is true. In the first place, she reflected on the fact that we should all be encouraging shareholder democracy. I think we agree with that: we should be encouraging shareholder democracy. The President of the ACTU says:... there is a correlation between good corporate behaviour and long-term profit and shareholder value. I think we agree with that as well. The President of the ACTU also says this:Once unions might have seen shareholders' interests as opposed to those of workers, but this can no longer be the case. The fact is that shareholders are all of us.We agree with that. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `What is your point?' What intrigued me was these words from the President of the ACTU:While superannuation shares are increasingly significant we also acknowledge that a shareholder culture is extending beyond wealthy Australia as evidenced by the float of major companies such as the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra ...What we are seeing is a change of policy from the Labor Party. The person who dictates policy at the Labor Party is saying that privatisation is good. She is saying that shareholder growth is good. She says it is great that the ideological battle of days past is all over. That is what the President of the ACTU says. So you have to ask: what is intriguing about that comment? Wait a second - the ACTU said that it would fight privatisation all the way and it would fight the sale of Telstra and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank all the way, so what is the hidden agenda? Sharan Burrow reveals it a little later when she says this - and I confess that I did not know this fact about superannuation: Employee representatives, whether elected or appointed by unions, make up half the boards of funds with almost half of total superannuation assets - around $200 billion. What the President of the ACTU is saying is that the ACTU controls half of Australia's superannuation funds - $200 billion. - I will repeat it because the Labor Party does not understand it. Employee representatives, whether elected or appointed by unions, make up half the boards of funds with almost half of total superannuation assets - around $200 billion. The ACTU has a troubled history when it runs any business. It had a troubled history with New World Travel, it had a troubled history with Bourkes and it had a troubled history with ACTU Solo. Now the ACTU President is saying that they control half of Australia's superannuation funds. It comes as no surprise that, up in the Senate, the Labor Party is fighting tooth and nail against choice of superannuation for Australian workers. It comes as no surprise that the ACTU, in conjunction with the Labor Party -  - It comes as no surprise that, when it comes to individual choice for workers, Sharan Burrow and the ACTU are saying the workers should not be able to choose who their superannuation is managed by because half of it is managed by the union movement. That is a denial of the consumer sovereignty that is meant to form part of the Labor Party's platform. It is a denial of choice. Consumers have no choice at all about where their superannuation is invested or who invests it. When we find that the Labor Party in the Senate opposes choice of super at every single point, we need only come back to the fact that we discovered, through the words of the ACTU President, that the union movement controls every Australian worker's funds by 50 per cent. If the Labor Party is serious about consumer sovereignty, if the Labor Party is serious about putting consumers first and if the Labor Party is serious about giving individual workers choice, then it should support the passage of choice of super in the Senate. Then Australian workers could have some control over their funds instead of leaving it to the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The answer to the first part of the question is: yes, I do recall that study by Professor Richard Teese. It was based on data collected in 1994 after 11 years of Labor government. Those results were recorded in the western suburbs of Melbourne after 11 years of federal Labor government. They do not relate in any way to the policies of this government.Our concern about the complete failure of the Labor Party's education policies in relation to social justice in education is what led us to direct our attention to precisely those students in the senior years of schooling. We have essentially introduced a revolution in the last two years of schooling, with the introduction of broad vocational subjects taught at industry standard, and school based apprenticeships that give these young people opportunities that they have never had. In the last year of the Labor government, there were some 26,000 students doing vocational education in schools, and you could not say that they were necessarily quality courses. This year there are 167,000 students doing quality vocational education courses, which are providing job opportunities they never had under your government. In relation to the last point, where you refer to the 62 so-called richest schools, that claim is based on the thoroughly discredited educational resources index system which Labor introduced. Labor's system for categorising schools has been thoroughly discredited and is not now endorsed by any sector in non-government schooling. Labor destroyed the integrity of the non-government school funding system, and any reference to those categories by the Labor Party now - which has itself officially abandoned its support for that system - is totally fallacious and carries no validity whatever.</DOC>

 - I thank the excellent member for Hughes for her question. There is a lot of support for the government's changes to school funding; in fact, every association in the non-government sector supports the change. The reason for that is that they are aware that the Labor Party completely destroyed the integrity of the non-government school funding system. The Labor Party refused to fund parish schools at their assessed level of need. The Labor Party refused to fund new schools at their assessed level of need, and so prevented many lower income and working-class families from exercising choice of school. The Labor Party froze the funding for a number of schools in the non-government sector for 15 years. Some of those schools received no real funding increase for 15 years because of the ideological interests and the influence on the Labor Party of the Australian Education Union.There is an interesting contrast between the rhetoric and the reality. I just looked up the figures as to how many of the members of the Labor front bench went to non-government schools. - They're all just as good as each other, aren't they? Mr Speaker, 40 per cent of the Labor front bench attended non-government schools. The member for Kingsford-Smith is not here. The member for Reid, the member for Batman, the member for Hunter, the member for the Northern Territory and the member for Wills -  - Mr Speaker, may I say that these are all very good schools and not only that -  - My point in drawing attention to this interesting fact is that the parents of these frontbenchers on the other side exercised school choice, as they were entitled to do. They chose what they believed were very good schools for their sons and daughters. What is puzzling many members, I think, is why the frontbench of the Labor Party are so opposed to extending choice to lower income and working-class families. Why are they prepared to exercise choice for themselves but not prepared to extend choice to working-class families? That is why they capped the funding for needy schools. They refused to fund needy schools at their assessed level of need. They refused to fund the parish schools at their assessed level of need. They were prepared to deny choice to others that they wanted for themselves and which they exercised for their children. If you ask why this is so, Mr Speaker, you can only assume that they received a call from Shazza or Dezza to say, `You've gotta go along with us and really criticise this legislation if you want to get our funds and our votes for the next election campaign.' So the total hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue is completely revealed: they take benefits for themselves that they are not prepared to give to others. It is no wonder they have no support in the non-government sector and why the Catholic Education Commission, the independent schools and the Christian schools regard this legislation as important and why they are urging the Labor Party to pass it at the earliest possible moment, because they want a socially just and fair funding system for schools.</DOC>

 - The government does not mandate the choices that parents make. Our aim is to build up the quality of all schools in Australia. That is why we have introduced literacy standards for students in all schools and introduced literacy assessments that are transparent to parents, which the Labor Party refused to introduce when in office, with the consequence that, after 13 years of Labor, 30 per cent of young people could not read and write properly. That is not a social justice policy; that is a policy to entrench social disadvantage. That is a policy that helps to build up the quality of all schooling in Australia. - We are also boosting funding to government schools in Australia at a faster rate than any of the state governments and, of course, we have addressed an issue that was never addressed by the Labor Party in office: the educational opportunities for 70 per cent of young people who do not go on to university. As a result, parents are seeing the quality of government schools going up. They are exercising choice within the government sector, between sectors and within the non-government sector. Our aim is to have parents able to choose between quality schools in all sectors. That is where our policy is leading. We are finally putting in place policies that will actually give those opportunities to all students in Australia, not the ideologically, vested special interest education policy that you put in place that destroyed educational opportunities for so many young Australians and destroyed their employment opportunities when they left school. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is interesting that, in his now infamous Townsville speech, the Leader of the Opposition made the following comment: `You will find in regional Australia in particular that bulk-billing is starting to disappear.' This did not ring true, so I asked the Health Insurance Commission to provide me with the figures comparing 1995-96 - the last year of Labor - with 1999-2000, the last calendar year. If you look at rural, regional and remote Australia, there were 27.8 million services bulk-billed in 1995-96 and 30.5 million services bulk-billed in the last financial year. If you look at this as a percentage of all services, it has gone from 61.1 per cent in 1995-96 to 62.4 per cent in 1999-2000. If you compare this with urban Australia, where the bulk-billing rate across all services has gone from 74.1 per cent to 75.3 per cent, not only has bulk-billing increased in rural and regional Australia but it has increased at a faster rate than it has in urban Australia. This shows that the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to say or do anything to try to put a point of view that he cannot back up with factual argument and that he certainly does not understand health. </DOC>

 - If the Labor Party is ever going to make a serious contribution to the debate, it will have to get rid of that shadow minister. Mark Latham knows that. - Mr Speaker, I am directly on the question, because of course there have been no cuts at all to government schools funding and no cuts to government grants. There have been absolutely no reductions in school funding in any year of this government. In fact, grants from this government to government schools have increased for every state and territory in every year since 1996. The Labor Party is trying to run this EBA, which they clearly do not understand -  - You have got no idea about how it operates. It does not give a dollar to non-government schools, and it occurs in a context where funding for government schools is increasing year by year. In fact, funding for government schools is growing faster than that of any state or territory, and I challenge the states and territories to match the performance of this government in funding government schools. The question is based on a total falsehood and just goes to show that the member for Dobell has absolutely no capacity to advise the opposition on education policy. The member for Werriwa - fronting him after a caucus meeting late last year - said to him quite clearly that he had not made a single policy contribution to the Labor Party in his entire time in parliament.  - Get real. - I had not concluded my answer, Mr Speaker. My conclusion is: get real.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question, and I note that unemployment in his region peaked at 12.8 per cent in 1993 and it has now almost halved from that peak. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition told a Townsville audience, `The number of long-term unemployed has been virtually stagnant over the course of the last four years.' This statement by the Leader of the Opposition is simply wrong. - It was full of falsehoods. Long-term unemployment is down 50 per cent from its peak of nearly 360,000 in July 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment - a job he described at the time as a poisoned chalice. Trend long-term unemployment has fallen every month for the last 23 months, and it is now 20 per cent below the level of March 1996. The Leader of the Opposition was at it again later in his infamous Townsville speech, when he said that long-term unemployment was too high, `because all the assistance programs that get the long-term unemployed back into work have gone - and the good case management has gone as well.' That is what he said. In October and November 1995, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment, the then Department of Employment, Education and Training conducted some research into the effectiveness of those programs for which the Leader of the Opposition is now so nostalgic. This research said:Many job seekers believed that case management was just another way of shuffling unemployed people around so that the official figures would change even if only very few people obtained sustainable jobs.So job seekers did not like his programs. The research went on to say:Many of the case managers and CES staff felt that Working Nation was not genuinely aimed at reducing real long-term unemployment but merely at reducing the unemployment figures.So the CES did not like his programs. The research also said:Employers claimed they were less concerned with applicants having had the relevant training than they were with their attitude and commitment to the job.So employers did not like his programs either. Of course, the figures for long-term unemployment are too high. Of course, employment services are a work in progress and they are constantly being refined. But what is absolutely clear is that, on both counts, the situation is much better now than it ever was when members opposite were in government. </DOC>

 - I think it is widely known that the government at the present moment is presenting a public discussion paper which takes in the views of the Australian public in relation to the white paper which will be produced at the end of the year. I must say that it has been widely received within the community, with a very large number of people responding to it, both within the community itself and within the ADF. When I speak to members of the ADF, they are very appreciative of the opportunity that the government has extended to them to be able to make their views known on what the white paper should contain at the end of the year. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that the government, when it draws up the white paper, should be able to review the full strategic picture and be able to assess what capability Australia needs over the next 10 to 20 years. So it is not unreasonable under those circumstances that a planned and considered view be taken of so major an acquisition as the AEW&amp;C purchase would have been. The decision to defer the acquisition was so that it could be reviewed in terms of the white paper. I regard that as an extraordinarily responsible decision, one which enables the government to take a wide view of all capabilities on offer to the ADF at the present moment. I contrast this with the mismanagement of the acquisition program by the Labor Party over many years. During that time the acquisition program was never managed. There was a great big order back in the 1980s and the financing of that was left until the 1990s. In that time Defence spending as a percentage of GDP ran down from 2.8 per cent or 2.9 per cent to about 1.8 per cent when Labor departed from government. Under those circumstances, the carrying out of the acquisition program itself was forced and a lot of the things were not purchased according to the original specification. Remember the old Labor Party thing: built for but not with. Therefore, you had boats going around with no guns or armaments in them - built for but not with. That is one of their specials. We only have to go to some of the major projects to see what mismanagement went on: submarines, JORN and the amphibious landing craft.  - Not quite. - It is not often that I get a chance to expand on Defence matters. As I was saying, the government has taken the opportunity not only to look at the future through the white paper but also to reflect on the Labor Party's record in government in terms of managing the Defence portfolio. As a consequence of that I pointed to three areas of glaring error: submarines, JORN and the amphibious landing craft - all of which ran hundreds of millions over their original contract price and years over their contract time. This government is setting out in the white paper -  - Can I conclude my answer by saying that the government believes in managing its projects appropriately. That will be done through the white paper program, and that will be announced at the end of the year. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. Before the implementation of the government's A New Tax System, the Australian Labor Party in this House whipped up doom and gloom in the community and generally created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty about the GST. In fact, in the six months from 1 January to 30 June this year there were 241 questions and 10 matters of public importance from the Labor Party on the GST. I remind the House of the Labor Party's predictions that the GST would bring Armageddon, that it was going to be nightmare on main street, the rhetoric of the slow drip and so on. In fact, it was quite graphic as well. The Labor Party came into this House with lots of props. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was holding up a pair of pyjamas. Where are the pyjamas today? And the pink cardigan - who can forget the pink cardigan? Or the bag of salad that came in? And the member for Wills had the home decorations magazine. Remember that? But who could forget our friend the member for Bass talking about the Launceston Examiner? Today I am releasing the ACCC's third quarterly report to the government as required under the Trade Practices Act for the period covering 1 April 2000 to 30 June 2000. I quote from page 5 of the ACCC report which states:Based on its monitoring activities and assessment of data available to it, to date the Commission has not found evidence of price changes generally anticipating the GST.So all of those scare campaigns that the Labor Party ran in this House meant nought. The ACCC received 43,000 telephone calls over the three months to 30 June, and they ran 3:1 as inquiries and not complaints. More than 75 per cent of the calls to the ACCC before 30 June were inquiries and not complaints. This totally refutes the Labor Party's dramatic high jinx and shenanigans and, in the words of the Prime Minister, it confirms the Labor Party's humbug.</DOC>

 - I have not seen that but I will have a look at it. I always try and keep pace with my reading requirements, but maybe the reason why I have not got around to reading that was that my eyes were absolutely transfixed on the transcript that was thrust under my nose by the ever vigilant press secretary who works for me. It is a transcript of a speech made by the then Leader of the House on an urgency motion which was moved by the then Manager of Opposition Business. Both of those gentlemen have changed their positions since this debate took place. The Leader of the House has become the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business has become the Prime Minister. But what is interesting is not so much the positions we held at that time but the description given by the then Leader of the House to the excise adjustment made by the then government without warning and in defiance of promises in 1993. Do you know what he had to say? He said:First, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) repeated this furphy that the Liberals go on with - that the Australian public was lied to during the election campaign - And listen to this. This is the best bit:by virtue of the fact that small adjustments have been made to petrol taxes and sales taxes.What he defined as a small adjustment was a 5c discretionary increase. Against that background, with that record, you have no credibility on this issue.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the honourable member for Dawson that my attention has been drawn by the sugar industry task force, which comprises coalition members in this parliament representing electorates where the sugar industry is making an important contribution in very difficult circumstances, to the economy and the community life of those electorates. At the beginning of this answer I want to pay tribute to the members of the task force chaired by the member for Dawson but comprising the members for Leichhardt and Hinkler, and other coalition members, all of whom have worked very hard in a very constructive fashion to draw the government's attention to the difficulties faced by this very important industry particularly, but not only, in the state of Queensland. It will be no secret to the members of the task force that the government has had their representations under very close scrutiny over the past few weeks. I want also to pay tribute to my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for the very effective work that he has done on behalf of the industry.  I am aware that the industry has been suffering very severe problems from low prices, crop disease, cyclones and flooding. The combination of these problems has resulted in very great hardship for growers and communities in many parts of Australia. The Commonwealth, in response to these concerns, has decided on a substantial and comprehensive package of support for the sugar industry in Australia, and I believe that that support package will be very widely welcomed not only in the industry but also in the communities where the industry bulks so very large in the life of communities. The package will include the following components. There will be interest rate subsidies to help growers get their crops in for next year and take advantage of higher prices. It will provide income support for growers while they are working their way out of the current difficulties. It will provide support for farmers to receive financial counselling and business planning advice. The Commonwealth will also work with the industry on restructuring so that they are in a stronger position to deal with any future hardships. My colleague the minister for agriculture will visit Queensland tomorrow and speak to the Canegrowers Council and will announce full details of the package at that meeting. This is a very important package. The government has not lightly taken the decision to provide such substantial support, but we have done so because we believe that the industry has been placed in a very precarious position through forces beyond its control. In those circumstances, particularly as the regional impact of the industry is so large, it is appropriate that this kind of help be given. I believe that when the full details of it are announced by my colleague it will be seen by the industry as generous, comprehensive and substantial. It will be seen as a very broadly based, intelligent approach. It will also have within it the component of an obligation being asked of the industry in relation to the development of a restructuring package. It will be a demonstration of the constructive, realistic way the coalition addresses problems arising in industries in regional Australia which are caused essentially by forces beyond the control of those industries. I commend the package in advance to people in the cane growing industry and the sugar industry. I again thank all the members of the coalition sugar task force and the minister for the very constructive work they have put into the development of what the government and I believe is a fair, effective and long lasting response to the difficulties faced by the sugar industry in Australia. </DOC>

 - I know from long and salutary experience that you never accept anything they say about what you have said in the past. You always go back and have a look at the fine print and you find that there is a slightly different twist. The member for Rankin goes over old ground. The member for Rankin knows that many questions have been asked and the member for Rankin knows that the reason why petrol is at an unacceptably high price is that the world price of crude oil has gone up.   - I would have thought the member for Rankin knew all about indexation of excise. I think the member for Rankin worked for Peter Walsh when it was introduced. He knows all about it. He probably advised him. He probably stands in relation to Peter Walsh concerning indexation as the member for Jagajaga stands in relation to the former health minister and certain health policies. This is tilling old ground, but I am very happy because my patience is infinite in relation to question time. Unlike the short attention span of my predecessor when it came to question time, my patience is infinite. Let me take the member for Rankin through it very slowly again. The world price of crude oil has gone up from about $US12 a barrel 18 months ago to now around $US33 a barrel. That almost trebling of the price of crude oil is the reason why the price of petrol at the bowser in Australia is now so uncomfortably high. I might also remind the member for Rankin that figures I have cited in the House earlier demonstrate that the refinery price of petrol - that is, the price before you impose the GST or before you impose an excise - has gone up by more than the retail price. So any suggestion that there has been a contribution of -  - Oh, he has another point of order, has he?  - As I was pointing out to the member for Rankin, the refinery price, that is before you impose the GST or the excise, has gone up fewer cents per litre than the retail price, which rather blasts out of the water this idea that it is to do with the GST. As always, there is a Beazley quote for every question. The Leader of the Opposition talks so much that there is always a quote left around in a doorstop. This one was on the AM program when he was still in government, on 23 August 1993. This is what the journalist had to say. You must remember it, Kim. - The context of the interview was criticism of the government's decision to lift fuel excise. We have in fact cut fuel excise. -  - We have! We have cut fuel excise by 6.7c a litre. -  - But I have that list! I have a Treasury list of all of the adjustments. When you come to June of this year, do you know what it has got after a whole of lot of pluses? From 1983 onwards it has a great big minus. - Just listen to this. This is what the journalist on the AM program said:If it is so important for the budget to go through, what is so bad about giving poor people a bit of an extra break and perhaps not taking so much off them in fuel excise?This is against a background of the 5c a litre discretionary increase that nobody was told about. The reply from the now Leader of the Opposition was as follows: I would say that if you go to the record of the government over the last decade, the situation of those who are dependent upon government outlays in one way or another is improved. And you have to look at a budget not just in terms of a snapshot in time but what it reflects for a very substantial period of time.In other words, you had no answer at all. Absolutely no answer at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The government remains committed to working with the states -  - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The government remains committed to working with the states to develop a workable and responsible native title regime that balances the interests of indigenous people, miners and pastoralists. That is why we supported Queensland's alternative native title regime that has been before the Senate for some months. But the same cannot be said for the Labor Party. Yesterday, federal Labor served the Queensland people a complete mess. No-one is happy with this 11th hour compromise - not the Queensland people, not mining groups, not native title holders, and certainly not the member for Banks.It seems the only people willing to defend this second-rate deal are Mr Beazley and Mr Beattie. Quite obviously, federal Labor's commitment to sorting out workable native title regimes depends on whether a Labor government is making the request. This is hypocrisy at its best, but it is also policy on the run. Last year, in August, the Labor Party knocked out the Northern Territory's native title regime. Three months ago, Labor allowed part of the New South Wales regime to pass through the Senate without even a murmur. Now your Queensland mates get a half-baked deal that delivers some political satisfaction to Mr Beazley and Mr Beattie, but nothing to anybody else.  Queensland Indigenous Working Group chair, Terry O'Shane, was outraged, saying that the opposition leader has blood on his hands. Today, ATSIC commissioner, Ray Robinson, said:As far as Beazley is concerned, he is a sell-out. His shadow minister, Daryl Melham, has virtually told the Australian people that. That is what he has done. He has sold out indigenous people. That is why he resigned.He made an error. He failed to acknowledge that Mr Melham is now a former shadow minister. The Queensland Mining Council chief executive has described this half-baked deal as a `total disaster'. Labor's weak deal continues the uncertainty over native title that has gone on for a decade. Australians deserve better. They deserve consistent policy and consistent leadership. With the opposition leader, a lost shadow minister and a compromised premier they have neither.</DOC>

 - I am aware of industry reaction and it has been very strong. It makes it very plain that in fact the ALP's fooling around with its failed policy approach to native title in Queensland is going to have a very serious effect on investment, employment and regional development in that state. For example, Mr Michael Pinnock of the Queensland Mining Council said: Clearly opposition leader Kim Beazley and his Labor colleagues remain oblivious to the plight of the exploration sector which has been brought to its knees - That is by their failed approach. That has been referred to around this place. We have a comment from the Executive Director of the Minerals Council of Australia, Mr Dick Wells. He put it in pretty blunt terms - `a no-win/no-win decision'. He also said:This has profound implications for the future growth of the minerals industry and the wealth and employment opportunities it provides to Australia.He makes this very important point:This decision will do nothing to assist indigenous communities sharing in the economic benefits generated by mining activity.Those benefits in Queensland have been and are quite substantial and could, if the ALP were able to actually get its act together, prove to be of even more benefit in the future. That is the real tragedy in all of this: it is the very people that Labor says it is interested in protecting that suffer the greatest harm from its policy failure in this regard. Labor seems to be incapable of understanding a very simple equation - that is that today's exploration is tomorrow's jobs. Today's exploration is tomorrow's investment in jobs, and jobs for Aboriginal people in particular. In fact, in Queensland, there are no less than 20,000 direct jobs and 80,000 indirect jobs. -  - These former people from the ACTU with their profound concern for jobs! They talk all the time about jobs. They do not care about jobs - only their own. They are the only jobs they care about. The fact of the matter is that 20,000 direct jobs and 80,000 indirect jobs -  - I reckon I can demonstrate a bit more concern, in light of your comments, for the jobs of battlers in rural Australia than you can - a damn sight more concern. - Your reaction displays your cavalier attitude to battlers in rural and regional Australia. It is as simple as that. - The fact of the matter is that we have got a lot of jobs, direct and indirect, in rural and regional Queensland that all started out with an exploration permit for mining. What have we got as a result of your actions? At the end of last month - unbelievably - there were 1,200 exploration title applications pending in Queensland. Compare that with the number granted between July 1999 and the end of May - just 94. They are not proceeding. In real terms, exploration expenditure in Queensland is at its lowest level for 22 years and still falling. For the March quarter, expenditure was down 20 per cent on the previous quarter, down 15 per cent on a year earlier. The plain and simple fact is that exploration in Queensland has been grinding to a halt because of native title problems and last night the ALP jammed the brakes on even harder.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also thank him for his personal support for the development and the implementation of the indigenous employment policy. We doubled the funds available, as the member knows - and money is important - and we provided more resources. But also, importantly, we as a government have been prepared to try a few new ideas to see if we can do better in terms of indigenous employment. Where something has worked in the past, we have been prepared to give that a go. We have certainly kept the wage assistance. - We had some changes to help CDP. - No. We introduced some changes to CDP which I think were novel and innovative and worth trying. - In respect of wage assistance, we recorded our highest level of participation in July this year, so that is going well. We attempted to expand the cadetships. We had some positive developments there, but I would like to see more Australian companies take on the cadetships. We have also established the small business fund, and I think that is not only a chance for people to start a business but also to create jobs. More generally speaking, we have established the chief executive officers' initiative for indigenous employment - the CEOs' initiative. That is going pretty well too, and we have been making personal approaches to some of Australia's biggest companies on the basis that whatever they have done in the past - and some have been active - we would like to encourage them to do more in the future. Thirty-five such CEO agreements have been signed. Amongst those 35, we do have some of Australia's leading mining companies prepared to make a real effort. I want to mention some of them - Henry Walker, Rio Tinto, Normandy Mining, Anaconda Nickel, Pasminco, MIM, BHP - and the big mining contractors - Thiess Contractors and Roche Brothers, just to mention some. You do not need to understand a lot about the dismal science of economics to understand what the Courier-Mail said in their editorial this morning. They said: Those who negotiate the proposed indigenous land use agreements will have to recognise that exploration is an essential prerequisite to mining and the creation of opportunities for Aboriginal people.Our Aboriginal and indigenous Australians are some of the most disadvantaged, if not the most disadvantaged, and it is terribly important that we give them the opportunity of jobs. I am grateful for the fact that some of Australia's mining companies are being prepared to make the effort that they have. I was in WA the other day - and you will knock that one back I suppose, because it is a coalition Western Australian government -  - There they were, committed to a hundred people -  - Where are the jobs going to come from if the Labor Party uses its numbers in the Senate to prevent our mining companies expanding and growing and providing job opportunities? This is a classic case of a Leader of the Opposition who has one policy one day and another policy the next -  - and he is inconsistent -  - and now there is his embarrassment in being forced -  - Nothing can be more important, in my view, than that this parliament focuses on the needs of indigenous Australians and what we can do to provide them with a few jobs. I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed by the consequences of his own weakness. And he ought to be held to account for the indigenous people who will not have jobs as a result of his policies. The cant and hypocrisy that you people go on with! And you, by your actions, are denying the most disadvantaged people the chance of a job. - Mr Speaker, it is a pretty obvious point. We see that this Leader of the Opposition has got a different policy every day of the week. He flip-flops and responds to the pressure of the last person to put pressure on him. - The people who suffer as a result are the most disadvantaged. He ought to be ashamed of himself.</DOC>

 - Yesterday I outlined the reason behind the deferral, and it related to the government's white paper. The white paper is put in position so that over a period of some 10 years you can properly analyse the acquisitions that will take place over that period of time. It is appropriate, therefore, that this deferral should have taken place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. As members will know, this government has given top priority to making sure that every young Australian has got the chance to read and write. We have sought to remedy through our policies the disastrous situation left by the previous Labor government when not a single study into the best methods of teaching literacy skills was done over 13 years. The results of literacy surveys were suppressed, including by the Leader of the Opposition when he was education minister, and when he left office, as we found from the national English literacy survey, some 70 per cent of young indigenous Australians could not read and write at a satisfactory level. Nothing showed more clearly the utter failure of the Labor Party to achieve anything like educational equity or social justice for indigenous Australians. This week is National Literacy Week, and National Literacy Week highlights the achievements of a number of schools in Australia which have gone out of their way to give educational opportunities to young Australians who previously missed out. In fact, tomorrow at St Mary's School in the electorate of the federal Treasurer I will be presenting 11 schools with major awards to represent their progress in improving literacy outcomes in their schools. These schools range widely in Australia. Interestingly, these are schools particularly which have focused on giving educational equity to indigenous Australians. One of the schools which is quite outstanding in this regard is Yipirinya School in the Northern Territory, one of the year's major award winners. This is a school that, when this government came to office, had 12- and 13-year-old indigenous students who could not even read a kindergarten text. Within one year of implementing the new literacy program, Accelerated Literacy, which this government has funded, these students made at least three years progress in their literacy in their reading levels. They have gone from struggling to read picture books to reading Paul Jennings novels in less than one year.This demonstrates that a government which is determined to address these issues of educational standards and educational equity can make progress. It highlights the tragedy of the 13 years of the Labor Party in government and the utter failure of the Leader of the Opposition when he was education minister to offer any educational leadership whatsoever in this country. It is the Howard government's strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy skills which is opening up opportunities for young indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister has launched the National Indigenous Literacy Strategy, and we now have some 15 indigenous literacy ambassadors travelling to indigenous communities, urging parents to make sure that their young people go to school and urging schools to work closely with communities to provide culturally appropriate education. This government has addressed the issues of equity and social justice in education, which have been unaddressed for a decade and a half.</DOC>

 - I welcome the honourable member's interest in Telstra. It does not surprise me that there is interest on that side of the House in the announcement of the dividend. The government welcomes the announcement yesterday of the results of Telstra. Labor's interest does not surprise me. I noted with great interest that the man that tells the truth in the Labor Party, Mr Della Bosca, has $4,000 worth of shares in Telstra. I noted that the secretary of the Labor Council in New South Wales has $18,000 worth of shares in Telstra. Mr Roozendaal -   - I am sure that those members of the Labor Party also welcomed the dividend that was announced by Telstra the other day. Let us have a look at the question that was put up by the honourable member for Perth. He asserts that there would be a benefit if Telstra were retained in government hands. That is a false assumption. He is working off the basis that a dividend such as this week's dividend of $4 billion would go to the shareholders. He ignores the fact that all companies make provision for future investment. They do not always declare the actual result; there is a need for future investment. - He ignores the fact that, as a result of the sale of the first and second tranches of Telstra, this government has been able to retire a significant amount of Labor's debt, bringing it down from $98 billion to some $50 billion. We have wiped out $50 billion worth of government debt. He ignores the fact that as a result of giving the board of Telstra an opportunity to operate in a truly commercial fashion, accountable to over two million Australians, they have been able to deliver savings on telephony services to Australians in many areas and at the same time improve the service. He should have got up today congratulating Telstra on improvements, under the customer service guarantee brought about by this government, to service levels to all Australians in all states, particularly in rural and regional Australia. Operating on economic voodoo, he conveniently looks at a dividend, ignores the factors relating to the market and ignores the investment that Telstra has made. He simply wants to draw simple conclusions. They are simple, and they do not work. This government wants to unshackle Telstra to give it a proper opportunity to trade properly in the interests of all Australians and in the interests of some two million Australians who have shares in Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can inform the House that there is new evidence that business is increasing its confidence as a result of the introduction of the new tax system. Indeed, the AICD-KPMG Boardroom Report for September 2000 is headed `Company Directors, Economic Optimism Returns Post GST' and I quote:Fading uncertainties about the GST have led to a strong improvement in economic optimism of Australia's company directors this quarter.It is a good thing that company directors are showing economic optimism. The report continues:The survey reveals confident predictions from directors about Australia's economic performance in six to 12 months time, more so than the June quarter, and 44 per cent of company directors predict a positive outlook for the Australian economy in 12 months time, a 16 per cent increase over the June quarter. Both sides of the parliament no doubt would welcome the fact that company directors are receiving the new tax system with a great deal of optimism and confidence. The interesting thing is that this confidence and optimism is something which the Australian Labor Party predicted would never occur. On 18 June, in an interview with Jon Faine, where he does some of his best interviews, the Leader of the Opposition predicted that the tax system would be `chaotic and complex'. - No, it rates with his Townsville speech. The Leader of the Opposition said:It was chaotic and complex to start with and now it is in spades. I mean, you're talking about irrelevance. Every single stunt that we ran in that run-up or that consideration of the GST by parliament a couple of weeks ago they're now actually adjusting the tax system to deal with. So we're no longer in stunt land. We're in tax planning land ...`We're no longer in stunt land.' I do not know whether he has told his Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has been in stunt land for the last 15 years of his life, who specialised in bringing Hockey Bear pyjamas into the Australian parliament - the party of Chifley and Curtin, with their Hockey Bear pyjamas and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with his little lettuce packages. The contribution to tax reform by the member for Hotham will always be remembered in the parliament. That was just about the most sane thing he has said about tax in quite some time.The current stunt is about petrol excise. We have established two things in this debate. One is that they have no intention of taking GST off petrol and the second is that they have no intention whatsoever of changing the indexation on excise. Every time they ask the government whether it will change its policy on indexation of excise, one needs to remember that the Labor Party has no intention whatsoever of doing so. In fact, it is urging us to adopt a policy which it does not have. That is the whole argument that it is putting in relation to petrol. `Why don't you take a policy which we don't have?' Talk about living in stunt land. On the Michael Spooner program, the member for Hotham was asked on 31 March 2000:What sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?That is an obvious question. After all, you ask questions about it - you have had four or five. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition replied:Well, what we've - basically our position has been - there needs to be a mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes. We've always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime.Talk about being in stunt land. Come into the parliament, ask four questions about changing the indexation of fuel excise, and when you are asked what your position is you say, `Oh, we don't want any changes.' The opposition are not in tax planning land; they are still in stunt land. We have been sitting here since 1 July and what is one word I have never heard come across the lips of the Leader of the Opposition? Roll-back. It starts with an `r' and it is one word - `roll-back'. They are so proud of their policy that it never rates a mention. They are not in tax planning land; they are still firmly in stunt land.</DOC>

 - It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition still has not received a satisfactory briefing on the enrolment benchmark adjustment from the member for Dobell, because the enrolment benchmark adjustment is not a school funding policy. It is not a policy which directs money to schools. It does not in any way determine funding flowing to schools. Those decisions are taken by state governments. And we see a dramatic variation in the willingness of state governments to fund government schools.The elements of school funding to which the Leader of the Opposition referred are all subject to decisions by the government. There is no automatic flowing of money to schools without a decision by the government every year. So you do not understand the process of indexation. You do not understand the enrolment benchmark adjustment. At least you have recognised that we are putting additional money into schools for special needs funding. The total impact of the government's decisions is to increase funding for government schools by $402 million over this year, over the period when you were in office. That is a 26 per cent increase in funding for government schools, while the number of pupils in government schools has increased by 2.3 per cent. That means that, as the numbers in government schools have changed, the government's funding has become ever more generous in relation to those numbers and that real funding for government school students has increased. It is a shame that the Leader of the Opposition knows so little about education and has such little interest in it, which he demonstrated when he was minister. He had no interest in the portfolio; everybody could see that. He took no significant initiatives or decisions and he does not even understand the basics of government school funding.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, because he does raise a serious issue in relation to the reason why numbers of people are held in detention for quite long periods of time. It would perhaps be useful to let the House know that something in the order of 116 people at the moment are held in detention while pursuing matters before our courts, and that is something in the order of 12 per cent of the current litigation caseload.There are a number of examples that I think would be illuminating to the House. One was a person who illegally arrived in Australia in March 1997, was refused a protection visa in June 1997, went to the Refugee Review Tribunal - which came to the same conclusion in September 1997 - applied unsuccessfully to the Federal Court, did not appeal to the Full Federal Court when he lost at the first instance but went to the High Court in December 1997, and commenced another High Court action in 1998. The High Court unanimously dismissed both of those appeals in April 1999. In other words, that person chose to be in detention, with no lawful basis to be in Australia and no lawful basis to overturn any of the decisions that were taken as early as three months after arrival and, of course, remained in detention because of his own actions.I could take you through other cases that are very similar, but let me just say that there is a new and very alarming trend emerging. That trend is in relation to people who have exhausted all other remedies, who have been to the courts and who are now applying under the complaints mechanisms to United Nations committees, asking them to comment on whether or not there is a basis upon which a person should not be removed from Australia, and seeking our cooperation with a view to ensuring that in that time they are not removed. Those bodies, on average, take 18 months to two years to come to a conclusion. In only one case have they come to a view that there was matter worthy of looking at, and what is not on the public record is in relation to that matter: the Refugee Review Tribunal, at my request, has looked at the case again and found there was no substance or credibility in relation to the claims and that, in fact, the very person who was making the claims had no credibility because, at the time he was alleging torture or otherwise had been applied to him in his home country, he was in a third country making asylum claims. We have something like 24 cases of people who are going before various United Nations tribunals now who will remain in detention while that happens. So how can anybody be heard to complain in those circumstances when their own actions have led to a situation where they remain there for one, two, three or four years. I am complaining because we end up having to foot the bill. Can anything be done about this? I know the honourable shadow minister is not here today. But I know the shadow minister says from time to time, `Look, it is a fundamental principle that even people who have come to Australia unlawfully should have access to judicial review.' That is what he asserts. Of course, what he is saying is that, on this issue, Labor is part of the problem, because there is a bill before the Senate that would enable these issues to be dealt with quickly. Nobody has to remain in detention for that length of time. It can be resolved quickly and, as I say, you are part of the problem.This is an issue upon which the Leader of the Opposition should be prepared to make a stand. This is an issue upon which the Leader of the Opposition should say to his colleagues, `We can fix this by cooperating.' I am sure he does not have to worry about the shadow minister for immigration resigning on this question as a matter of principle. Let me conclude by saying that there is a concern expressed by the Labor Party from time to time that there are other people in Australia unlawfully taking jobs from Australians. They argue that, if they were in office, they would do something about it - presumably. - No, I have been talking to some of your mates in the trade union movement. Let me tell you that there are 5,000 people who have already been to court who have no lawful basis for remaining in Australia and who are using abusive class actions to ensure that they remain here lawfully. There are 5,000 people holding down jobs that might otherwise be available in the Australian community. Who is holding up the legislation that would deal with that? The Labor Party. As I said before, there are some problems in this area, but the reason we have these problems is that the Labor Party is part of the problem, not the solution.</DOC>

 - It is hard to understand how someone can hold even a shadow portfolio and understand so little about the basis of education policy. Everything that the shadow minister says is completely misconceived. The government, for a start, has increased funding for government schools, not reduced funding for government schools. The enrolment benchmark adjustment is a federal-state financial transaction; it does not constitute a school funding policy. Therefore your statement that it has taken $60 million from government schools is incorrect.Let us come to the last point. Your reliance on category 1, the old Labor funding formula for non-government schools, puts you at odds with the entire non-government sector. It is a funding formula which has been completely discredited and which does not represent a listing of the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia. Let us go right through this very slowly so, hopefully, you will understand it next time and we will not get this misrepresentation.  - You have claimed that the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia will be receiving an average of around 30 per cent of average government school recurrent costs under the government's new funding arrangements. - You called them the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia. There is a very clear understanding that the government's SES funding mechanism is a much more accurate measure of need than the Labor Party's now discredited funding system, which the shadow minister continues to support, contrary to the views of everybody else in the non-government sector. I have had the government's measure applied to the simulation project data that we carried out over the last couple of years. It shows that, under the government's SES funding formula, none of the schools serving the 62 wealthiest communities in Australia will be funded at the levels that you have indicated. - You are totally and completely wrong. You have claimed that an average level of funding will be applied, but no individual school will be funded at that average level amongst the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia, identified by an accurate measure of the wealth of the schools' communities. So your whole assumption about the allocation of that money is completely fallacious. Read the transcript of this if you are not following me, because it is very clear to other members of the House. This funding formula will allocate funding amongst schools according to need.Let me conclude on one point: there will be some schools amongst the 62 wealthiest schools that will receive funding at a higher level only because we have funding-maintained those schools. They will receive that funding only because you have funded them at that level. We have frozen their levels of funding. The only schools that will be funded at the levels you are talking about will be the schools that you have funded - at your level of funding - and we have taken a fair decision not to take their funding away from them. Every school funded under our formula will be funded at a lower level amongst those 62 schools than what you claim is the average level; in other words, you are totally and utterly incorrect and you are totally and utterly offside with the entire non-government sector. You are the last voice in Australia claiming that the Labor Party's discredited funding system has any merit whatever.It is not surprising that the last party to stand for the wholesale sales tax system is also the last party to stand for the ERI funding formula for non-government schools. You are totally isolated. Not only do those opposite say that our system is a bad system, but they are going to vote for it. They are going to keep our funding system when they are in office. It is so bad that they are going to keep it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I note that unemployment in her area has come down from 13 per cent in January 1993 to six per cent now. It is still too high, but it is a big improvement on what it was, thanks in part to the policies of the Howard government.I am also aware of the member for Riverina's acute interest in the citrus industry, hence her interest in the report of the National Harvest Trail Working Group which was presented to the government on 11 August. The government immediately announced that the harvest labour site on the Australian Jobsearch system would be upgraded to provide more comprehensive information on work, accommodation and transport available in harvest industries. We anticipate that that work will be on offer to job seekers by October. From tomorrow, my department is trialling in the Riverland a new system in conjunction with Centrelink, under which able-bodied job seekers will be required to look for harvest work as part of their activity test requirements. This has been welcomed. The Mayor of Renmark has said:With the buoyant conditions that most of the state, and certainly this area, has been having over the last few years, there is definitely a shortage of harvest labour. Growers find it particularly galling to know that, when they can't get labour, there are able-bodied people around on the dole. I am sure they will welcome the scheme with open arms.I would like to thank the committee that put this report together, particularly its chair, the member for Hindmarsh. The idea of a national harvest trail came from her. She has pursued it to the point of fruition. This is a shining example of how a member of parliament can make a difference to the wider community. I also thank the member for Mallee, the member for Hume and the member for Blair for their contributions.I thank Mr Michael Beeston, from the Macintyre Valley Cotton Growers Association, Mr Brian Caddy, representing the Riverland; Graham Robertson, representing Sunraysia; Brian Clark, from the MIA Council of Horticultural Organisations; Vic Dolenec, from the Mildura District Harvest Labour Committee; Stephen Scott, from the Northern Victoria Fruit Growers Association; and Mr Bill Trevor, the Mayor of Isis Shire.

 - The Catholic system uses the SES funding model to distribute their funds amongst their own schools. - Let me quote Father Doyle, the Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, which rejects the ERI model and which has made it clear that it does not in any way support the ERI model.   - The commission, which does not in any way support the ERI model and which fully accepts that that model is completely discredited, said this about the government's funding package for schools. I quote Father Doyle:It is a very good and equitable package. The new system is fair and open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise every person's right to choice.That is the view of the National Catholic Education Commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question on what is a very serious topic for Australia. Australia has a disappointingly low and declining rate of organ donations. We have about 8.6 donors per million of the population per year, which by any international standards is pathetic. It is disturbing that this very low rate is declining. The UK has a rate of around 13 per million, the United States, 21.4 per million, Spain, 33.6 per million and our neighbour New Zealand manages 10.2 donors per million of the population. Australia's very low rate would be even lower if it were not for the very good efforts of South Australia, which has a rate of donation three times the national average. This current performance translates into very real difficulties for people who are waiting for organ donation. Two people on the organ donation waiting list will die per week and more than half of those waiting for heart, heart-lung or liver transplants will die before a transplant becomes available. The international benchmark of world best practice is nearly 1,100 donors per year for a country our size. Last year Australia managed only 194 donors against that international benchmark of 1,100.I have traditionally taken the view that this is a state and territory matter because it relates largely to the way that public hospitals operate, as this is where most suitable potential organ donors die. I was very much moved earlier this year on New Year's Eve when the Prime Minister and I went to visit Sir William Deane who was having a sleep-over for about 50 kids who were waiting for kidney donations. He is patron of the Australian Kidney Foundation. Talking to those children and hearing their stories and the anguish of the families of these children waiting for organ donations made me look at the issue again to see whether there was anything the Commonwealth could possibly do.As a result of that meeting that the Prime Minister and I had, I was able to announce in June this year that we would be setting up a National Australian Organ Donor Register to try to address this issue. The organ donation register will do two things. Firstly, it will enable families to be able to discuss the issues towards a better understanding of what individuals would like towards the end of their lives. Secondly, it will enable organ donation coordinators to securely access the information and help them in seeking the consent of family members. The Health Insurance Commission is going to develop and run the National Australian Organ Donor Register and it will give it very substantial publicity in a whole variety of ways - one which springs to mind is when we reissue the Medicare cards for Australia this year. The register will commence in November 2000. We are planning a large communication campaign to be associated with it.  I took this approach to the Australian Health Ministers Conference in Wellington last month. They were very supportive of it. We had a lengthy session discussing the measures that they would take to try to complement this. I believe that, by working together, this country can turn this around very rapidly and do something for the many people who are waiting for an organ donation.</DOC>

 - First of all, let me tell the House that at the end of last week the Australian Ambassador to Burma made representations directly to the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister expressing Australia's deep concern about the attitude of the Burmese authorities to Aung San Suu Kyi. The Australian government is not silent over human rights abuses in Burma. The Australian government has repeatedly criticised, directly to the Burmese authorities and publicly, human rights abuses in Burma. It makes no attempt whatsoever to `snuggle up' to anybody in Burma. The Australian government's position is that it is appalled by the standards of human rights in Burma and it certainly deplores the way Aung San Suu Kyi has been treated over a very long period of time - over a decade - including at the present time and during the last week. The Australian government is quite happy to join with other countries in deploring that treatment.The honourable member asks whether we should conduct human rights training courses with Burma. I appreciate him asking the question. We have two choices. One is to go down the Labor path and do nothing. Your policy is to do nothing - absolutely nothing - and you think doing nothing would improve human rights in Burma. What is interesting is that the Australian Labor Party - for all its professed concern about human rights, which, as we know, is mock concern - condemns the government for taking a proactive measure to try to encourage an improvement in human rights in Burma. We have no economic motives. Burma is not some enormous market that Australia is trying to penetrate. We do not have any ulterior motives. We have the sincere and honourable motive of trying to improve human rights in Burma.In the last decade - and the Labor Party was in power for a lot of that time - I can point to only two positive things in Burma that have happened in the area of human rights. The first is that middle level officials have been prepared to engage in discussions with Monash University, acting on behalf of the Australian government, on human rights standards and international human rights norms. The second positive thing that has happened is that Burmese authorities announced at a recent meeting of the Asia Pacific Forum on Human Rights - which was established by this government - in Rotorua in New Zealand that Burma would be prepared to establish an independent national human rights commission consistent with the Paris principles. Whether they do or whether they do not, we will wait and see. But in 10 years they are the only two positive things that have happened on Burma and we are proud to say that we have made a contribution, albeit a very small one, to taking forward human rights in Burma rather than doing what the Labor Party is proposing to do, which is absolutely nothing. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for the question on the issue of the recent report of the United Nations Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Committee. First, I simply observe that this report demonstrates the need for reform of the United Nations treaty implementation process. It does so because, quite different from many other reports that we have seen recently, it did acknowledge the government's efforts to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. It did so in acknowledging the allocation of increased funding of $2.3 billion in the recent budget - that is in real terms more than in any previous budget of any federal government. It also acknowledged the need to work in partnership with indigenous communities in initiatives aimed at providing greater access to indigenous peoples to culturally appropriate health services and through the reconciliation process.The committee also noted that parliament itself had expressed a commitment to reconciliation and its deep and sincere regret for past policies that have negatively affected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The committee also recognised the important work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the proposals outlined in the document of which we are all very much aware. The government sees these comments - particularly as the committee encourages us to continue to pursue these efforts to address what are acknowledged situations of disadvantage - as an endorsement that it is a practical approach to Aboriginal reconciliation. It is a very important matter, one which this parliament has recognised and one where I think we all agree that we should continue in this way. I want to assure the House that the government intends to address positively and constructively the disadvantage that does face our indigenous people. We are proud of our record, particularly in relation to health, education, housing and employment. We recognise that there is a need as part of a continuing process to work on these matters, and we will have the item of reconciliation listed on the next meeting agenda for COAG. Of course, reconciliation is a matter positively pursued by both the Prime Minister and me. This is in stark contrast with what we see on the other side of the House where, unfortunately, the Labor Party do not even seem to be able to agree on how to progress these issues, let alone on who should progress them. The depth of division within the ALP I think can best be demonstrated by the resignation of the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs on a matter of principle as he saw it. Unfortunately there seems to be a battle in the Labor Party about the portfolio, but it is not the normal sort of battle that we see; it is one where nobody seems to want the portfolio responsibility. I must say I agree very much with the comments of the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Gerry Hand, when he said today, `I think it is one of the greatest privileges that you can have, to work in the area of Aboriginal -   - The Manager of Opposition Business is right that in fact the matter is not relevant to the minister's portfolio responsibility. He was asked a question about the government's response to the UN report, and I would ask him to address that question. I will listen closely to his answer. - Mr Speaker, thank you very much for your guidance. Let me say, of course, that the committee was commenting on issues relating to indigenous peoples, and the committee was making it very clear that the policies of the government were worthy of endorsement, as it did, and I think the committee by implication was making it very clear that indigenous people ought not be used and abused, that people should not see the portfolio as a poisoned chalice. I think the former member, one of our colleagues, when he said that they would do us all a favour -  -  - I think members of the House and the former member are vitally interested in who was the one that said, in relation to this issue, that if you were given the portfolio responsibilities it was like having the job of cleaning in the Titanic. - This issue is one that is important to us all in this House. -  - I have sat through many addresses and many speeches in this House now over some years. If I had to observe about those people who had no commitment and demonstrated by their own actions a total disinterest I could well describe it in the terms which you have just used in relation to me. It would be clear to the Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition, that if he had any sensitivity about these issues he would be one who would be standing up here and very much regretting what has been said. The comments by those members of the Labor Party who have demonstrated that when the Right says to the Left -  - Let me again make it very clear, Mr Speaker, and I would not want in any way to infringe your rulings: this is an issue where those who have been making the sorts of speeches that I have heard month after month are clearly walking away from any commitment to our indigenous people. When you are fighting over the portfolio - which you are, not to be involved - this is an area in which the Leader of the Opposition ought to show some leadership and apologise for what has happened. </DOC>

 - Let me thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I have been looking forward to a question from the honourable member for Bowman in relation to immigration and multicultural affairs issues. The question relates to an issue I addressed when he was absent from the House last Thursday. I made it very clear that there are people in Australia who are held in detention for unreasonably long periods of time. One of the reasons they are held in detention for unreasonably long periods of time is that they are advised that there are ways and means by which they can delay removal. One of the ways in which people delay their removal from Australia is - after they have exhausted consideration of refugee claims, after they have had an opportunity to go before the Refugee Review Tribunal, after they have been to the courts -  - Let me just put the matter in perspective. The individual complaints mechanism in relation to the convention dealing with torture is a mechanism that is available when all other avenues of potential appeal in relation to removal from Australia have been exhausted. It is important that members know that not only have they been through the refugee process, that they have been before the courts, but that they can also apply under section 417 of the Migration Act for consideration of my discretion if they have claims under the torture convention. So anybody who has claims relating to torture has the opportunity for those matters to be put clearly before me and for them to be considered before removal. The torture convention is now being used by people to effect a delay of up to 18 months to two years while people remain in detention in Australia, while the system is abused. We have some 18 people now pursuing those claims. They have never been used, except in one case, with any efficacy at all. In the one case where it was used we now know that it was not efficacious. We know that the person who was making the allegations had no credibility. He was clearly in another country, in another place - not the place where he was making assertions that he was being tortured. Honourable members opposite may care to know that both Holland and Canada have refused to accept advice from the individual complaints mechanism and have removed nationals making these complaints because the complaints mechanisms are being abused to keep people who would otherwise be unlawful within their borders. What we said the other day was that so far as this government is concerned if people are making manifestly unfounded claims and we are asked by the complaints mechanism to withhold removal we will no longer automatically accept that recommendation.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his very longstanding interest in the United Nations and the effectiveness of the United Nations committee system. The Prime Minister is indeed on his way today to the UN Millennium Summit. Naturally enough, through both the Millennium Summit and the General Assembly, which will take place after it, Australia will be continuing to raise its view that the United Nations treaty committee system needs to be substantially improved. This criticism from Australia of the effectiveness of the United Nations treaty committee system and the need for reform of the committee system is supported by many. It is supported by Mary Robinson, for example, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and it is supported by many of the member states of the United Nations. It is the government's view that the credibility of the treaty system depends on its effectiveness. If the system is weak, as it currently is, its very weakness undermines the efforts of the committees to improve human rights around the world. We would like to see the committee systems operate effectively and have credibility, not be ineffective and incredible. The problem at the moment is that their credibility has been very much undermined by some of the approaches that some of the committees have taken at certain times. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs made clear, the latest United Nations committee report on Australia is more considered than reports from the other committees. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that this is a committee which makes recommendations - some of which are factually erroneous, I am advised - on how the Australian industrial relations system should work and how we should be operating our public hospitals. It is the view of this government, if not of the opposition, that these are matters that we should determine here in our own country. It is reminiscent of CEDAW, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which produced a report on Ireland which criticised the influence of Catholicism in Ireland and an earlier report which criticised Belarus for reinstating Mother's Day. I do not think there is anything wrong with Mother's Day myself. Yesterday was Father's Day, and my own children were very generous to me. I am sure they will reciprocate later in the year when Mother's Day arrives.  -  - No, I did not get breakfast in bed.  - I think you have a good point, Mr Speaker. Some of the debate here really does stretch credibility. I notice that the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Don Henry, suggested that rainforests in the Amazon and the Congo are now under greater threat because of the government's decision to campaign for reform of the United Nations Human Rights Committee system. It is a sad day when NGOs in this country take positions like that. On this side of the House, we ultimately believe that an international agency should not be dictating Australian policies, that ultimately this very chamber here, the Senate and the Australian parliaments all around the Commonwealth are responsible for our democratic processes, for the policies of this country. That responsibility does not rest overseas. I think there is a stark contrast between our position on that, which is a very clear and unequivocal position, and the position of the Australian Labor Party, which is as clear as mud. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that just last Friday he announced a $150,000 grant for indigenous employment in Eurobodalla in his electorate under STEP, the trainee program known as the structural training employment program. That and the other examples that I have talked about myself in this place, such as the Aboriginal Employment Strategy, which has been very handsomely supported by the minister directly behind me out of his portfolio and which is now proving to be a very practical example of reconciliation and community building at the local level, leads me to inform the House that four community justice programs are now being started in the north-west of New South Wales as a further advancement of practical reconciliation. The initial steps to implement these programs have now been taken in Bourke, Walgett, Condobolin and Brewarrina. This particular scheme is all about indigenous people taking responsibility for programs and seeking solutions to their own problems. It is about self-dignity and self-worth. The proposal was put to me by an indigenous leader. I saw the value of it and we have been able to now assist in putting it together. It is a partnership with the Unity of First People of Australia and Chubb Security; it will give indigenous people accredited training as community justice leaders. They will work in addressing a range of problems - alcoholism, aimlessness, parental and community disrespect and theft. It is a 12-month paid trainee program. It includes 12 courses - community justice, community offender management, principles and practices of security officers, paramedic training, occupational health and safety and so forth, communication, performance management, personal development and other such concepts. It will be largely focused and pulled together at a two-day meeting in Walgett in November of this year to further progress social economic and social disadvantage questions for Aboriginal communities in those areas.  This sort of approach stands in stark contrast to the ALP's attitude. Their attitude, for all of the chest beating and all of the self-congratulatory noise we hear from the other side, really has been exposed in the last couple of days for what it really is. It can only be said, I think, that responsibility for Aboriginal affairs on the other side is obviously a job that no-one in the ALP wants. The member for Fremantle, newly reinstated - or about to be reinstated - to Labor's frontbench, does not want the job. Labor's Left, again, despite this chest beating over the years on indigenous issues, does not want the job. - One of yours. `A poisoned chalice' was one description trotted out from Labor's ranks this morning. Then we had the most disgraceful exposure of all, with one Labor Party member describing responsibility for Aboriginal affairs as `like being the toilet cleaner on the Titanic'. That is what we heard. That is a shameful, hurtful and outright disgusting comment. It really is. It is appalling. - The Leader of the Opposition says `name the person'. Well, I notice a former colleague of his says that he ought to out whoever was responsible for it. No wonder the person did not want to be identified - did not want to be named - because they would be universally condemned for it. I think a very important point has to be made here, and that is that if the Leader of the Opposition had any real leadership qualities, if he had any real pretence to being a suitable alternative prime minister, if he had any real standing in this matter, he would have come to the dispatch box at question time today, sought your indulgence, and repudiated those comments and told the House what action he was taking against the person involved.</DOC>

 - In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, let me just again affirm that the view of the government is that the torture convention should not be abused by asylum seekers seeking to use it as a way of delaying their removal from Australia. What we have said, and it was made clear in the statement last week, is that if it is being abused by people who are intent on remaining in Australia when they ought to be lawfully removed we will no longer accede to requests to delay removal. There is nothing unreasonable about that approach. As I said earlier, it is an approach taken by the Dutch; it is an approach taken by the Canadians. We now have 18 requests, and when you have the opposition out there railing, as they have, about the length of time that people are in detention, I am surprised that anybody would be advocating that people should be able to abuse the torture convention by using the individual complaints mechanism to maintain themselves in Australia when there is no substantial issue to be addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. Before I come to it, I think the House would want me to pay tribute to the Essendon Football Club for the premiership win on the weekend. I think all members would congratulate Kevin Sheedy, captain James Hird, chairman Graeme McMahon and chief executive officer Peter Jackson on a fabulous result. I am joined by the member for Melbourne in that tribute. -  - And to Melbourne, too, who fought out the grand final. I have previously reported to the House on the level of success in the implementation of the new taxation system. I think, from all of the evidence which is now coming back, the business community is coping well. We have seen a lift in confidence from the business community as Australia sorts out its new taxation system. We have also seen that small business have made one thing absolutely clear, and that is that they have no interest whatsoever in any so-called roll-back of the goods and services tax, with the business Yellow Pages indicating recently 65 to 25 against roll-back. Interestingly enough, the last time I heard the Leader of the Opposition mention the word `roll-back' in this parliament was in June. We go through his transcripts every day trying to find any mention of this wonderful policy of roll-back which he seems so proud of that he buries it almost on a daily basis. The government's tax reform mandate was obtained at the last federal election. It was the unprincipled refusal of the Labor Party to accept the electorate's verdict which meant that they took the cheap and opportunistic road of voting against tax reform in this country, even though they always intended to keep the goods and services tax if they were ever re-elected. Then, of course, they engaged in this stunt of roll-back without ever mentioning what they would roll it back to or when or how or how much or how they would pay for it. They became an opposition whose central opportunism betrayed a lack of principle. That lack of principle now permeates the whole of the opposition. We saw the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs resigning last week - and being congratulated by the Leader of the Opposition for his principle in refusing to serve in a shadow cabinet led by the Leader of the Opposition! The Deputy Prime Minister has referred to the lack of principle in filling the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. As AM reported this morning, we have a prominent Left figure complaining that the Right is constantly trying to do over the Left in caucus on Aboriginal issues. He says -   - I am asked about principle permeating policy, Mr Speaker. The Left  said:If the glimmer twins are such experts on indigenous affairs, they should put their hands up for this office of Aboriginal Affairs. - Mr Speaker, we are certainly supporting either of the glimmer twins for Aboriginal affairs. The opposition will sort out the kind of imbroglio it now has itself in over Aboriginal affairs only if it gets honest on the central economic issue of this parliament, if it comes clean and it says its opposition to tax reform was only ever opportunistic, if it comes clean and it says roll-back is now a failed policy which has no prospect whatsoever of being introduced and if it comes forward and apologises to the parliament for wasting the last two years by opposing a reform which it knew was in Australia's interest and which it had every intention of keeping. I said last week this would have to be the weakest opposition in economic terms that Australia has ever seen, with the weakest leadership. Until it can come clean on those central issues and while it is permeated by opportunism, Mr Speaker, you will see repeats of these policy failures over and over and over again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the Voluntary Service to Indigenous Communities Foundation is under way. It has been launched by the Prime Minister. It is an innovation in terms of delivery of assistance to indigenous communities around Australia. It relies upon those communities making contact with the foundation, which will effectively have a database - a bank, if you like - of skilled people from the broader Australian community who are willing to give their time to assist those indigenous communities. There is a toll free number which is available. If anybody is interested in volunteering their services, we would be very keen to pass on that number to them.The foundation is hoping to implement 12 projects around Australia to fine-tune the program to get it under way. We are hopeful that, not just in the short term but more importantly in the long term, this particular program will provide real assistance to indigenous communities by transferring skills generally available in the Australian community to those communities most disadvantaged. I do want to acknowledge the support that I have had, as the employment minister, within the cabinet for the introduction of these policies. The cabinet does in fact have a team of people - senior people - associated and responsible on a day-to-day basis for dealing with these very practical issues facing indigenous communities. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation is, of course, well known in this regard. My colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care, in respect of health programs, has a strong personal commitment to this area as a leading member of the cabinet. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has done a lot to expose those areas where we need to do more for indigenous communities in respect of literacy and numeracy. The Deputy Prime Minister, for example, in his Regional Affairs portfolio and also as a local member has given a lot of support and momentum to providing practical solutions to real problems on the ground. In fact, the program going on in Moree can be a bit of an example of a program that we might make more generally available.It is an interesting contrast that on this side of the House, within the government, we have senior people who have a commitment to this issue, who on a daily basis are attempting to improve the lot of Australia's most disadvantaged people. I am asked if there are any alternative policies; you would be hard pressed to find an alternative policy when you cannot even find a shadow minister with the responsibility for the policy. It is very interesting to see the Leader of the Opposition when he is under a bit of pressure. The Leader of the Opposition was up in the House today saying, `On indulgence - this is not happening; this is not a reality,' yet we have a leading member of his frontbench who knows it is a problem. The member for Dickson has been out today saying - Government members - Oh! - She does not think it is a non-existent problem; she thinks there actually is a problem. She says:I just think that it is a bit unseemly that we look as though we're not treating the Aboriginal affairs portfolio with the dignity and the importance that it deserves.She is not getting up and saying that this is not a reality. She says:I am disappointed -  - I was quoting the member for Dickson, who said:I am disappointed -  -  - I thought that what she said was pretty fair and reasonable. She said: I am disappointed for Aboriginal people who might feel they don't matter in the factional game.That is a fair comment. The fact of the matter is that no-one in the Labor Party wants this particular job. Gerry Hand was quite right to say -  -  - You're another one who has knocked it back, I suppose! - It is a disgrace that the Australian Labor Party has a series of people who have rejected one of the most important portfolios -  - We on this side of the House consider this a very significant matter. Whether or not there is any alternative policy from the Labor Party on the issue of the disadvantage of indigenous Australians ought to be a matter of concern to everybody in this House, and it is now a matter of public record that we have members of the Labor Party who refuse to touch this issue because they consider it a poisoned chalice. This is a classic example of weak leadership by the Leader of the Opposition. He has the factional heavies doing all the talking behind closed doors, and all he can do is stand up and say, `It's not happening, it's not real; this is not our party.' The fact of the matter is that this is your party; this is the party of people like Gerry Hand who say that this is totally unacceptable. This is the party -  - You know there is a sensitivity when you get half a dozen points of order raised against you. They can deny the existence of this as much as they like, but the fact is that, as the parliament sits today, the Labor Party has no shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. There will be literally tens of thousands of Aboriginal people who today would share the comments and the reflections of Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC, who noted that this reflects a lack of interest in this particular policy area on behalf of the Labor Party. He is quite right to draw that conclusion. The comments of the member for Dickson just affirm the reality that the factions run the Labor Party. When it comes to a good factional stoush, they like nothing more - and to hell with the interests of people who are disadvantaged. Last week we saw -   - In conclusion, the words of Geoff Clark put it well. He said, `I would have thought that was a pretty low sort of blow.' It is a low sort of blow for Aboriginal people. We have the member for Perth, the member for Lilley, Senator Bolkus, the member for Jagajaga and the member for Dobell. Not one of them is prepared to stand up for the interests of these people. It says a lot about the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. Last Friday the former education spokesperson for the Labor Party, the member for Werriwa, launched a scurrilous attack on the National Catholic Education Commission for no better reason than that the Catholic church supports the government's fairer, more equitable funding system for non-government schools. The member for Werriwa accused the National Catholic Education Commission and the Catholic church of entering into a deal with the coalition to go quiet on the GST in return for additional school funding. This was a most disgraceful attack, it was a complete falsehood and we can assume from the fact that there has not been a single word from the Leader of the Opposition that he agrees with this attack, he agrees with what the member for Werriwa has said, because he has made absolutely no public statement disassociating himself from this disgraceful falsehood.I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that his silence on this matter has been very visible to the wider community. Dr Peter Tannock, head of the National Catholic Education Commission, which represents about 1,700 schools and over 650,000 students, said:It is outrageous. It is disgraceful that he should make an allegation like that ... just a joke and a bad one. What this shows is that the Labor Party's education policy is now being highjacked by members on the back bench and in the Senate because there is no spokesman worth listening to on the front bench. The member for Dobell has fled from the House yet again in question time. His seat is very often vacant in question time and it is vacant now. In the Senate, we have Senator Kim Carr trying to wage his one man class war. In the House of Representatives, we have the spokesman for Senator Kim Carr, the member for Dobell, providing a pale shadow of him, and we have the member for Werriwa dragging up outrageous and false allegations for base political purposes. Through it all, the Leader of the Opposition sits absolutely mute. There is a shambles behind him in the shadow education portfolio. He cannot find anyone who cares enough about social justice to fill the shadow Aboriginal affairs portfolio. He sits there mute with chaos behind him on the front bench and on the back bench. In this shadow portfolio, he does not have the personal strength and integrity to stand up for the truth and to refute the outrageous allegations of the member for Werriwa.The government's policy for funding government schools has support right across the non-government sector. The Executive Director of the National Council of Independent Schools Associations said:The new funding arrangements will enhance educational choice for all families and provide improved equity to school funding arrangements.Peter Crimmins, the Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools said:Choice in schooling is now a reality for working class Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and also for his efforts, along with the honourable member for Dawson and other representatives of sugar industry areas in Queensland and New South Wales, for their representations on behalf of sugar farmers and the particular concerns confronting that vital Australian industry. The sugar industry produces about $1.5 billion worth of exports every year. It is particularly important to many of our northern communities because every $1 earned by sugar farmers engenders a further $3 in community wealth. It is also especially important because basically all of that wealth returns to regional communities and therefore provides a significant boost to so many of our regional towns and centres. The honourable member for Hinkler has the distinction of having the only city in Australia - Bundaberg - which has the entire sugar industry from beginning through to the end product located in the one regional city.The industry has been confronted with some particular difficulties: historic low world prices, low sugar content, cyclones and flooding. More recently, the outbreak of orange rust in the most important variety, rat plagues and all of these sorts of things have severely affected the viability of many of Australia's cane farmers. On Thursday, the Prime Minister announced to this House that the government would be providing substantial assistance to Australian sugar producers. Last Friday, I was able to provide more details about that assistance. It includes interest rate subsidies to help farmers replant their crops. That is a very important task because it is essential that we get rid of the orange rust prone variety as quickly as possible. There will also be subsidies on interest rates and assistance with income support to help those families who are victims of sugar farmers' low incomes. There will be help with financial counselling. Also, through the FarmBis program, there will be farm management and skills training for the industry. That is very real and practical assistance to farmers at a time of particular need.Centrelink will be administering this program under the leadership of the Minister for Community Services and are already putting in place the necessary mechanisms so that farmers can access this assistance quickly. There has been tremendous support for this package. Cane farmers, the industry itself and, indeed, editorial writers and others have all warmly welcomed this package. We have actually received praise from none other than the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, who said:I just say to John Howard, `Well done.'You do not very often get that sort of praise from Premier Beattie, particularly in view of the appalling response of the Queensland Labor Party and the Queensland Labor government to the plight of the sugar farmers. All they were prepared to offer was $10 million worth of loans, which effectively is less than $1 million in assistance. They valued the Queensland cane farmers at about $170 each. When the Queensland government came out with its quite miserable offer of less than $1 million, the shadow minister described that as worthwhile assistance and said that it should be congratulated on providing that level of assistance. It is interesting to note that when this government came out with a package totalling $83 million in outlays - but in fact amounting to about $400 million worth of loan assistance - the shadow minister thought that was inadequate and fell well short of what was required. So $1 million from the Labor Party is all you can expect of it, but $83 million - supporting $400 million worth of loans - was inadequate from our side. I understand that the opposition has a job vacancy on the other side - a post that nobody wants to fill. Obviously the honourable member for Corio has lost all credibility in agriculture, so perhaps he is one the Leader of the Opposition might like to consider for the post. Perhaps he can do a better job there.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can only assume that the opposition is feeling somewhat inadequate in terms of its record on economic management compared with ours. The simple reality is that the Australian economy has been performing extremely well and that the fundamentals for business investment and conditions in this country remain extremely strong. There is no escaping that reality. There is strong export growth, a pick-up in business investment and robust consumer spending, supported by high and very strong consumer sentiment. That will continue to be supported by tax cuts and by strong employment growth.Employment growth is something the opposition rarely talk about, because the performance under this side of the House has been vastly superior to theirs. Not only is unemployment at levels that you were not able to generate - that, historically speaking, we have not seen for a very long time in this country - but the real value of those wages has been rising. The interest rates in this country remain historically low. When I came into this place, a small businessman or a farmer who borrowed in this country was paying two or more times than his equivalent in America paid. Now it is roughly the same - if anything, in recent times it has been slightly lower. The small business variable overdraft interest rate has been, on average, five percentage points lower under us than it was under Labor. It is still less than half of that which applied at the start of the 1990s when the Leader of the Opposition proclaimed that he had a role in the economic management of this country.The benefits of tax reform for business are not disputed by anybody. There was one begrudging concession from Labor before they came to support the GST which, of course, we all know they now do. They are committed to the goods and services tax and the attendant reforms, or at least we are told that they are no longer committed to and we hear nothing more of roll-back. But we did hear the shadow minister for trade acknowledge that the removal of the embedded taxes on exports in this country would help Australia's economic performance. Business costs have been reduced by between $7 billion and $8 billion as a result of the removal of a range of inefficient and distorting indirect taxes. The company tax rate is being reduced this year to 34 per cent and will fall to 30 per cent next year. Small businesses are also benefiting from reductions in capital gains tax and continued access to accelerated depreciation. The fact of the matter is that, by any indicator, the Australian economy is performing well. It is in sound hands. Investors in this country, I am sure, would draw only one conclusion from any casual observation of the Australian scene at the moment, and that is that they certainly would not want you running the show again. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of his constituents. All members of the House will be very pleased to know that the Australian Communications Authority released a report late last week on the level of Telstra's performance over the year June 1999-2000. It found that Telstra's performance in connecting new telephone services in both regional and urban areas has `improved significantly'. In major rural areas, Telstra's performance rose by 27 percentage points to 83 per cent, and in urban areas its performance in providing new services improved by 22 percentage points to 85 per cent. Consequently, we can conclude that the success of the government's customer service guarantee - which Labor failed to introduce over some 13 years of full public ownership of Telecom or Telstra - shows that legislated service standards and requirements are far more important than government ownership in protecting consumers' rights and service standards. From the first two partial sales of Telstra, the government has been able to inject some $2½ billion into telecommunications and into the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to improve rural and regional areas. I was fascinated by the comment from the Leader of the Opposition during a doorstop interview in the middle of last week when he was asked a question about Telstra's profit. His final words were - and remember that this is a Beazley `transcript a day' quote, as the Prime Minister told us recently:And when you look at the appalling way the Commonwealth has wasted the product of the first couple of tranches of Telstra's privatisation, you could only but agree with us, I suspect.Waste them? What programs have the government invested in that you think we have frittered away? What: the rural transaction centres, Networking the Nation, the untimed calls in extended zones or the building of additional rural networks? - The Leader of the Opposition is once again trying to walk both sides of the street. He claims that the government has wasted its investment in the Natural Heritage Trust and in Networking the Nation. He should tell us specifically what programs he opposes or believes are not worth investing in. I notice that in his final sentence he said `the government has wasted the privatisation', and he walked away from the interview. He did not stay to answer the obvious question: `Will you tell us which of these programs you believe is a wasted investment?' Is it extending SBS to 1.2 million more Australians in regional areas than previously? What about the $25 million to provide mobile phone coverage along the main highways? The list goes on and on. We have a whole series of improvements in rural and regional Australia that the Leader of the Opposition claims are wasted. He should stand and defend his ground, not run away from it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I note the sudden concern about, and interest in, the issues confronting rural and regional Australians. Rural and regional Australians well remember, of course, that the ALP's only policy for rural and regional Australia is to make it so expensive out there that nobody can live there. We have worked through this issue ad nauseam, and there are several points to make. The first is that there is very real volatility in petrol pricing at the moment and petrol prices are unacceptably high as a result of what is happening globally. We have all acknowledged that in this place. Indeed just last week I referred to the way in which we are seeing some very high spikes in some places - for example, in my own home area in two towns just an hour apart we saw a price of $1.11 in one and around a dollar at the other. At the same time we saw in Mosman in Sydney a price of $1.08. We really have been through this ad nauseam and there is little to be gained by the further pursuit of this matter by a side of politics that has used fuel excise as a milch cow. They thought nothing of increasing fuel excise not only in line with indexation but also as a discretionary measure to balance their failed budget - the battlers' fuel went up by 7½c in the breaking of their 1993 post-election commitment that they would not raise taxes. In fact if you take a graph line through where fuel excise would be if you were still in government -  - I conclude this matter simply by saying that we all regret -  - Let me illustrate the point I was about to make by referring to the member for Paterson and asking him this simple question, rhetorically, of course, Mr Speaker: has he informed his rural constituents that, had his people still been in power -   - had excise continued to increase at the rate it did when Labor were in government, motorists in his electorate would now be paying in excess of 50c a litre.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The overall approach of this government to human rights in Burma is not only to see that the Burmese people and the Burmese government are able to fulfil the international norms of human rights - which, of course, are well articulated in United Nations conventions and a number of other instruments - but also to see in Burma the restoration of democracy, which was snatched from the Burmese people just over 10 years ago. These programs that are being run are violently opposed by the opposition. I would not have thought that you would be getting up here trying to ask smart questions about whether UN conventions are included in these programs, because you are opposed to the programs altogether. This country adheres to United Nations conventions. We signed these conventions a very long time ago, and we obviously support other countries signing the conventions. But one of the points that is often made about United Nations conventions is that many countries sign these conventions and some do not live up to them. There is a long record of that. If I were in the Labor Party, I would not be too naive about the way the world works. If I were in the Labor Party, I would not continue with a policy of, on the one hand, saying you are concerned about human rights but, on the other hand -  - I would never be in the Labor Party, don't you worry!  That is the last thing I would want to do. It is the last thing on earth I would want - to be in a party that brought economic ruin on this country in the past. I would not want to be part of that, and no-one here would want to be. Thank you for your interjection! - The Labor Party talks loud on human rights, but when it comes to Burma you want to do nothing at all about human rights. That, of course, is the hypocrisy and the weakness of your position.</DOC>

 - The member for Fraser has been handed what one of his colleagues regrettably described as the poisoned chalice: he has been appointed the new Labor spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs. Now the member for Fraser should tell us where Labor stands on native title. People in Western Australia and people in the Northern Territory particularly want to know. The member for Fraser says he volunteered for the job that one of his colleagues described so distastefully yesterday. Given that he has described it as an honour and a privilege, he should ensure that honour is observed in the handling of native title issues. Labor proved last week that they can do deals for Mr Beattie in Queensland, despite protestations from the member for Banks. The question is: if I make determinations that the regimes in Western Australia and the Northern Territory comply with the Native Title Act, can the member for Fraser make Labor do for the Northern Territory and Western Australia what Labor did for Queensland and New South Wales? To do anything less will remove the certainty we all want. To do anything less will harm the mining industry and cost Aboriginal people jobs.I am currently considering whether Western Australia's proposed native title regime complies with the Native Title Act. Submissions from Western Australian representatives were due last Friday and I expect to be in a position to announce a decision soon. The Northern Territory has also asked me to reconsider its request for determinations, which I am in the process of doing. The Chief Minister has indicated that he will be amending his request to me to propose a similar compromise to that struck with Queensland: the removal of the right to negotiate in respect of low impact mineral exploration. If we judge Labor's policy by its record last week, this should secure Labor's support for the proposed Northern Territory regime. But Labor's track record is far from consistent. The member for Fraser needs to be able to assure Premier Court and Chief Minister Bourke that they will get the same level of attention from him and the Leader of the Opposition as Premier Beattie and Premier Carr got. Already the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that, if I approve it, Labor will disallow the Western Australian regime in its current form, in the same way that it rejected the previous Northern Territory regime last year. Clearly, federal Labor's approach to sorting out native title is inconsistent and duplicitous. There is one policy for Labor states and one for the rest.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is the practice of this government - and I imagine it was the practice of previous governments - that we inevitably participate in negotiations on conventions and protocols where they are multilateral conventions rather than storm out and refuse to negotiate. We negotiate. When the negotiation is complete, we look at the completed document and we give consideration to whether our government will sign it. In the end, after appropriate parliamentary consultation - something you never did - we make a decision on whether we will ratify it. Of course officials from my department were involved in discussions. But I would not necessarily take a lot of heart from a story by one of the world of journalism's great beat-up merchants, Mark Riley. I would not be too heartened by him. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton. He does have a genuine interest in Aboriginal employment. This government -  -  - It is a bit rich you saying that that is a joke given the last few days on your side. You could not find anybody who even wanted the job. There was no interest on your side. - There was just a factional squabble. - I was very pleased recently to be in Western Australia at Gosnells to hand out the graduation certificates for 11 indigenous Australians who had participated in a training program. I want to pay tribute to Ernie Bridges and his community organisation, Unity of First People of Australia, and its community justice program. It is a very practical program, providing jobs and dealing with the local situation in terms of problems with some unfortunate juvenile behaviour. I also want to pay tribute to Chubb Security, which has taken a leading role in providing job opportunities for indigenous Australians. This represents a good partnership between the community, local government in this case, the federal government and, in this case, Chubb. I was also recently in Western Australia with Hugh Morgan of the Western Mining Corporation. There we initiated a new training program whereby a large number of indigenous Australians will hopefully, over time, be provided with real employment opportunities in the mining industry.This makes a simple point, and that is that government needs to work with the community and with industry to ensure that our industries are vibrant and growing and that there is demand for their services and products, which will, in turn, ensure higher levels of employment. This government has done a lot to promote employment opportunities in the Australian economy. Unemployment is the lowest it has been for 10 years. That has not happened by chance; it has happened because we have had a deliberate policy to encourage industry development and therefore the jobs that flow from it. I am asked about alternative policies and the chances of implementing them. You have no chance of providing people with job opportunities if you are not prepared to support industry and the risk takers who are prepared to have a go and create those opportunities. This was a point made rather well, I thought, by a former finance minister - one of your colleagues - who said this about the new shadow minister for industry. What a joke! She is more anti-industry than she is pro-industry. It is not going to make jobs; it is going to lose jobs. No greater authority do I have than the following statement made not by a member of the coalition but by a leading member of the Labor Party - in fact a former cabinet minister and a leading member of the Western Australian Labor Party. Who would that be? None other than Peter Walsh. This is what he says about the industry credentials of Labor's new industry spokesperson: More seriously, in Canberra she abandoned the regional forest agreement policy put in place by her government in Western Australia in favour of green extremism.What is the consequence of that? A loss of jobs for indigenous Australians in regional Australia. But he says more. He goes on to say:She has also opposed industrial development - and jobs for Labor voters - in Cockburn Sound and praised in her electoral newsletter a Green ally who proposed to run against Labor in the State seat of Cockburn.This is not a policy to create jobs. - The quote from Peter Walsh was `and jobs for Labor voters'. Indigenous Australians are entitled to be Labor voters as much as anybody else. This is a matter of serious concern as this government works to provide job opportunities -  - We have done a lot more than you ever did when you were in office. The Labor Party are full of talk, but when it comes to a bit of action to actually provide some real jobs for indigenous Australians they go missing. What do we find when it comes to the allocation of portfolios? Is there an allocation on the basis of merit? No. The Leader of the Opposition cannot get anybody from the Left and he cannot get anybody from the Right, so he has to get somebody who is independent. - I will finish by making this simple point. We have a higher level of disadvantage in respect of Aboriginal indigenous unemployment in this country. The answer to that is the provision of genuine job opportunities. This government is working with industry to provide those opportunities, but when we look at the alternative policies - which was part of the question - and whether or not they are likely to be implemented -  - Unfortunately, the struggle is on Labor's side. There is a struggle because the Leader of the Opposition cannot stand up to a few factions and cannot make decent appointments to his own frontbench.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. Yesterday, I outlined the position of the government in relation to this matter when I affirmed very positively that the approach we are taking is one where it is quite clear that abusive claims are being made under the individual complaints mechanism and that we will adopt the same position that Canada and Holland have adopted of declining to accept the request not to remove people from, in this case, Australia. It is important that honourable members recognise that in the past there were very few claims in relation to the torture convention. I think over a period of something like seven or eight years no more than seven individual complaints had been lodged. We now have 18 complaints before the individual complaints body. - There are 18 complaints, I believe. It is a substantial increase. It is quite clear - as I said yesterday and last week - that there is abuse of the system by people who are seeking an immigration outcome. The protection system, and now the individual treaty complaints system, are deliberately pursued to keep people in Australia who have no lawful entitlement to be here and who have no entitlement to effectively steal the places that would be available to far more vulnerable people in refugee situations.As I said last week - and I will say it again in front of the honourable member - the fact is that there has been a very significant increase in the numbers of people coming to Australia unlawfully. The fact is that that has placed very significant strains upon the system in dealing with those issues. The people who will end up in detention over long periods of time, about which the honourable member complains, are those who use the legal system to test the limits of claims that might be brought, as well as those people who are using now the UN treaty system. The fact is that there are solutions to this matter. The problem that we face is that the Labor Party are no longer prepared to be part of the solution; they are now part of the problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The government has a major commitment to ensuring that Australia's strong science base is linked into the innovation system and that it contributes effectively to the generation of new enterprises and new jobs. I remind the House that in 1997 the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council became the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council. Last December I issued a white paper, `Knowledge and innovation', designed to strengthen research-industry links, which is now being implemented.Yesterday the government launched the report of the innovation summit, entitled Innovation: unlocking the future. This government is committed to making sure that Australia gets the benefits of innovation. I suppose the latest example of catch-up politics is that the Leader of the Opposition has now appointed the member for Fremantle as the shadow minister for innovation. This will provide the shadow minister with probably her first opportunity to talk positively about innovation. Last week, on 29 August in the House, she gave a speech against innovation. She aligned herself with two critics of innovation who, she said: ... are very sceptical about the claim that innovations in agriculture are absolutely necessary to save us all. In fact, those innovations have more often been driven by profit than by need.We have here an industry and innovation shadow minister who is against innovation and against profits. That is a great start. More than that, she is also against industrial development. Indeed, when I checked on her web site earlier today, I found that she is vigorously campaigning against industrial development in Perth. There is a vigorous protest against the Fremantle to Rockingham industrial strategy, and she makes very clear her attitude to this industrial development. The problem with industry, as she has made clear, is that industry pollutes. I quote her:Concerns about the project include ... the impact of an expansion in heavy industry on the pollution levels of local suburbs and the whole of the metropolitan region. Studies have attributed some of Perth's current pollution problem to existing Kwinana industry - which may be on the way out if Labor gets into office. Here we have a shadow minister who is against innovation, against profits and against industrial development. The Leader of the Opposition should have asked her a few hard questions before, rather than after, he appointed her. The problem was that he was too weak to stand up to the factional pressure. He had to give her something, and we now have an industry shadow minister who is against innovation and industry. We have an education shadow minister - he survived - who is excluded from the knowledge nation policy development process. We have an industry shadow minister opposed to industrial development and we have an education shadow minister who is opposed to the knowledge nation process.I have here a bit of help for the Leader of the Opposition in his search for the culprit who referred to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio as a poisoned chalice and being like a certain position on the Titanic. In our search through the databases, only one shadow minister has so far been able to be identified as having used both those phrases in the past. That shadow minister is the member for Dobell. - Mr Speaker, the question was about alternative views on education. - I am now referring to the views of the member for Dobell. The member for Dobell was quoted in Hansard on 26 March 1998. - I notice that the member for Dobell has in fact narrowed the search to the Left, although there was no clear denial. I refer to a press release issued by the member for Dobell when he became the shadow minister for education in which he said:I would have been happy to have kept the `poisoned chalice' of health but I'm very happy to get education ...So he is the only shadow minister who has used both those phrases. The Leader of the Opposition should now get each of the shadow ministers on the left to get up and issue a denial that they were the source of that accusation. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I will simply make a couple of very brief points. The first is that, when it comes to listening to the Australian people, I believe that, overwhelmingly, they would expect us to take the firm and appropriate approach we have to the reform of the UN committee system. The second point I would make is that I believe we are a government, from the Prime Minister down, that is extremely sound when it comes both to listening and to making the right and appropriate decisions, having accepted counsel.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I point out at the outset that Australia is a founding member of United Nations. We are the 10th largest contributor to its regular and peacekeeping budgets. Indeed it is worth recalling that this year the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, described Australia as a `model member of the UN'. It needs to be recalled, too, I think, that all of us are very aware, and proud, of the fact that Australia pulled together and led INTERFET, the UN sanctioned multinational force in East Timor, last September and that Australian soldiers continue to make a major contribution to stabilising the situation there so that the East Timorese people can build their new nation. It was Australia that rescued the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty from the Conference on Disarmament deadlock. We took it to the UN General Assembly and ensured its adoption by an overwhelming majority. Australia demonstrated similar leadership in the negotiations that concluded the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the recent reaffirmation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the best vehicle to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to move towards nuclear disarmament.So the current initiative of the government to reform the UN treaty system to make it effective and efficient should be seen in the context of the enormously positive and constructive approach this government has taken and will take to engagement with the United Nations. To make the point by asking the question rhetorically and to reiterate - as the Prime Minister posed the question in this place - I think it is worth repeating that in its most recent report on Australia, the CERD Committee, the one that deals with the elimination of racial discrimination, singled out Australia with 13 of the 15 recommendations labelled as concerns, contrasted with the number of concerns listed for China, 10; Pakistan, nine; and Cuba, one. I actually think that to suggest that in those circumstances the Australian people would not want us to pursue an efficient and appropriate treaty making process in the UN is to deny reality. The Australian people are committed to a fair go and to reasonable outcomes. They are certainly committed to being good global citizens, and I think all of the evidence on that is overwhelming. But we also expect, I think rightly, that we are able to be fairly described, to put our point of view properly and to have that recognised when we are considered. When we announced the review on 30 March, we made it quite clear that we were not thinking of walking away - as I heard a member opposite say a little while ago in an interjection - from our international obligations or from engaging with the UN system. Our concern is that the United Nations human rights treaty committees are not working as they should, and this is an observation with which, interestingly, the UN Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, agrees. We have decided on a series of measures to improve the effectiveness of those treaty committees, and I think it is only right and proper - and in terms of the question that was asked by the honourable member a moment ago, it would be expected by the Australian people - that we pursue these sensible outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I assure him that, in good faith, I was going to return to this matter at the end of question time today with some further information on the matters that he raised yesterday. I said nothing yesterday that was not accurate; the only observation I would make about what happened during my time as minister for primary industries is that a decision was made by industry and by government that we should move to substantially restructure the old IWS, which, of course, became the Woolmark company at that point of time. I would urge the shadow minister to be very responsible here, because his question yesterday, the figure that he raised and the way that he raised it are not likely to be helpful to Australia's wool growers. There are a couple of very important points that I want to make. The first is: Cape Wools of South Africa has withdrawn from the International Wool Secretariat, which is now known, as I said, as the Woolmark company. The 1998-99 annual report of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation - AWRAP - indicated that settlement of the terms of Cape Wools' withdrawal had yet to be concluded. The wind-up of the old IWS has been under way for some time, but this particular matter is yet to be concluded. Here is the important point and, I do urge in good faith, sir, that, out of respect for the Australian wool industry, you acknowledge this: the matter is now the legal and commercial responsibility of the AWRAP board and no-one else. It would therefore be quite inappropriate for the government to offer any comment. I reiterate that the speculative figures canvassed yesterday by the shadow minister were very unhelpful, and I suggest that he would do well to keep his own counsel on this matter, as he runs the risk of seriously undermining the interests of wool growers in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I recognise the interest he has had in improving the transparency of treaty making processes in this country. When this government came to office in 1996, we introduced major reforms to the treaty making process. We on this side of the House believe that the parliament should play a prominent role in scrutinising intended treaties. That of course is one of the great differences between the coalition and the Australian Labor Party.We introduced the tabling of treaties in the parliament; we made it clear that each treaty would be tabled to include a national interest analysis allowing parliamentary and community scrutiny of treaties; we established the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which of course gives the public the opportunity to come forward and express views; we have set up a treaties information database, and so on. In other words, extensive transparency has been built into the treaty making process.The honourable member asked if there are any alternative approaches, and of course there is an alternative approach: there is the approach of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party talk big in opposition, but when you look at the Labor Party's record you need to look at what they did in government. In government, the Labor Party basically operated a system of secret treaty making. They did not want the Australian parliament or the Australian public to scrutinise the treaties they made. What is interesting is that the Labor Party, which are such strong supporters of the individual complaints mechanism to the United Nations, made those complaints mechanisms possible. They did that in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and in the international convention against torture. The Labor Party acceded to protocols in one case and in the other two cases they signed up to the complaints mechanisms, and they did so without any consultation with this parliament or with the Australian people. The Labor Party, in my view quite rightly - and I do not often defend the Labor Party - were opposed to Privy Council appeals. But the Labor Party in government were in favour of United Nations appeals from the Australian parliament, from Australian courts and from Australian institutions, but they have done it without any consultation whatsoever with the parliament or with the Australian people. I think the Labor Party stand very exposed for their commitment to secret treaty making, for keeping the parliament right out of the process and, of course, for making sure that the Australian public were ignorant of what the Labor government were doing in terms of signing up to all sorts of obligations.</DOC>

I make it quite plain that I do not resile from my statement. I do not think I need to add to, or subtract from, that. That you should portray yourself as some latter-day convert to the interests of rural and regional New South Wales is very welcome, but the fact of the matter is that it does not wash.

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I can inform him that today the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends for the September quarter 2000 was released. The good news is that it reports a strong rise in business confidence. Mark Paterson, Chief Executive of ACCI, said:This is good news. The economy is performing well. The smooth introduction of the GST has largely dispelled concerns associated with the early stages of tax changes. Mr Bill Evans from Westpac said:As we have seen recently with consumer confidence, business confidence has bounced back from the sharp falls in the June survey.Again, this is new evidence from the business community on how they are coping with the tax changes, and confidence is rising as the tax system is improved. One of the things, of course, that would threaten business confidence in the tax system would be any roll-back of the GST. A strange thing is that you never hear the word `roll-back' in this parliament anymore. It has not been mentioned in this House since 1 July. We can remember how the backbench of the Labor Party used to give speech after speech against the GST, but do you hear speech after speech in favour of roll-back? On 21 July was the last time the Leader of the Opposition issued the word `roll-back'. It is almost as if he cannot get his tongue around the word. It starts with `r' and it is spelled r-o-l-l. On the 7.30 Report on 23 February 2000, the Leader of the Opposition said:... people are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we're going.They're also entitled to know exactly what we'd do in the next term of government with a GST ... People are entitled to know it and not be deceived.That is what he said on 23 February - `not be deceived'. The one thing you can never get an explanation out of the Labor Party on is `roll-back': what is going to be rolled back, when it is going to be rolled back, how much it is going to cost and how they are going to pay for it.It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 August 2000 by Michelle Grattan:It's an open secret that Mr Crean is strongly opposed to any roll-back that would make the tax more complicated ...Since every roll-back will make it more complicated, it is an open secret that Mr Crean is opposed to roll-back.This was a lazy opposition which said that it was going to surf into office on the GST. Why does it find itself in so much trouble today? Because at its heart was a policy fraud - the policy fraud that Australia alone of the industrialised world could have a wholesale sales tax. Today we now have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, being the last person standing in the modern world for a wholesale sales tax - he and the leaders of Swaziland, side by side. We have got the Socialist Left running finance and the Socialist Left running industry. What a team to go out to the business community! `This is our team,' they say to the business community, `two members of the Socialist Left and a trade union official.' That will be popular in the boardrooms. It will be as popular in the boardrooms as the roll-back policy. All we say is that it is a very simple proposition - roll-back. The people are entitled to know: tell us what, tell us when, tell us how much and tell us how you are going to pay for it. That is all we ask for, a policy. It is a very big ask from this Labor opposition. </DOC>

 - As I have noted in this place as recently as yesterday, there have been and are still some spikes from time to time in petrol prices in different places. There are; it is a matter of reality. But it works both ways. In fact, I got a letter today from somebody near Caboolture, north of Brisbane, saying that a week ago they were paying 92.9c a litre and that this week it is 82.5. You sudden, newfound friends of rural and regional Australians want to imply that it is all a one-way equation, that it is all up. It isn't. In fact, the member for New England yesterday informed me that in Tamworth fuel has been as low as 94.9c again. We would like to see it lower. The fact is that, on the automobile association's own figures, the gap between country and city pricing - that differential that has been of deep concern to a lot of people -  - I just make the point that it is obviously quite impossible to be able to monitor the price of petrol in every service station in every community right across Australia. But that does not hide the fact that despite the opportunists opposite, the opportunists over there whose willingness to stretch a point, to go to any length to obscure, to try to frighten, to try to mislead knows no bounds, the point remains that if you have a close look at the automobile association's own work it shows a narrowing of the gap.The other point that I make is that you do get some extraordinary spikes in cities as well as in the country. Where there is a suggestion that it is really untoward, as one member put to me in this House the other day, you have avenues available to you to refer them to - the ACCC. But let me make a couple of other points. This is coming from the team - the point has to be made again and again and again for those listening, whether they are out there listening to their car radios or wherever it is - that, when it comes to fuel excise, are the absolute masters of the rip-off art: the ALP. I mean, 500 per cent! Until everyone across Australia has heard the figure we will go on saying it: there was a 500 per cent increase in fuel when they were in power. The Leader of the Opposition does not deny it - a 500 per cent increase. If we were still on the same line - the member for Paterson is not here -   - When the Leader of the Opposition stood up to make a point of order he actually had an opportunity to repudiate my claim. He had another opportunity to repudiate it. The claim was that fuel excise increased by 500 per cent when they were in government. The member for Paterson is back in here. Let me make the point rhetorically again by asking this question: has he informed his constituents that, if they were still in power, on the graph line that you can establish under their performance for excise increases, motorists would be paying over 50c a litre now? No doubt, of course, the member for Paterson has in fact told his constituents that his next door neighbour in electoral terms, the member for Hunter, believes that the $500 million that is easing the country-city price differential ought to be scrapped.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I think all members of this House know how committed the member for Farrer has been to the people of East Timor. Not only has he written and sold a very successful book, but also he has given the royalties from that book to the people of East Timor. I think that is a great credit to the member for Farrer - a good man, a good member of the National Party and a good member of the coalition.I was very pleased to represent Australia at East Timor's ballot celebrations. I took the opportunity whilst there to underline Australia's continuing commitment to East Timor and support for efforts to meet the challenges that country faces - which are, as the House would know, very substantial - on its path to nationhood. While I was there, I was reminded of the very significant contribution Australians are making to the rebuilding of East Timor - not just our military, though certainly our military, but also the civilian police, who are doing a magnificent job, and all sorts of Australians from non-government organisations, our aid program and so on who are playing a vital role in rebuilding East Timor. I had very good meetings while I was there with UNTAET, the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, and with CNRT, the East Timorese umbrella political organisation. In particular, of course, we focused on concerns that we have about the border region. While I was there I renewed Australia's commitment to helping with the rebuilding of East Timor and I said that we would help with the building of the health and education systems. I also said - because we are, after all, the world's sixth oldest continuously operating democracy - that we would help with the development of East Timor's democracy. After all, it is in our interests as well as in their interests for East Timor to be a democratic country. I even went so far as to say that Australia would assist with the building of a parliament house for East Timor, which I think would be a very nice symbol of the democratic relationship between Australia and this new nation. Are there any alternative approaches? With my usual grace and my usual dignity, I took the opposition spokesman up to East Timor and brought him back.  -  - You mock him over there, but he was perfectly nice, I thought; perfectly pleasant. When I got back to Australia, I was shown a press release from the opposition spokesman, the member for Kingsford-Smith, who while he was there could not resist the temptation of scoring a party political point. Lo and behold, he put out a press release saying that Labor was totally opposed to helping the East Timorese build a parliament house. It is sad that the Labor Party should behave in this most expedient of ways. I hope the East Timorese do not ever read this press release.Let me conclude with another anecdote. When I was at the airport before I left East Timor, I spoke with AAP. The journalist from AAP asked me whether Australia would apologise to the East Timorese for its policies towards East Timor over the years. My answer was that the Australian government is proud of what it has done for the people of East Timor, and I think the Australian people are proud of what we have done for the people of East Timor. When I got back to Australia and I was browsing through AAP, I noticed that the member for Kingsford-Smith had been asked the same question. His answer was that Labor gave in-principle support for a parliamentary apology - presumably for the policies of Hawke, Keating and Whitlam. Had this been cleared with the Leader of the Opposition? Had it been cleared with the shadow cabinet? Did the judas of the shadow cabinet, by the way, agree to this policy? We would like to know if this is the Labor Party's policy. If it is, we look forward to the resolution coming forward and hearing the mea culpa from the Australian Labor Party and the response of Messrs Hawke, Keating and, once more of course, Whitlam.</DOC>

 - Nearly all the propositions that the member for Hotham puts to the House are false. If you are looking at what somebody is paying to the government, you have got to look at the tax they pay to the government net of the grant, which is what the RACV failed to do.  - When you are talking about the amount you pay to the government, I would have thought you netted off the amount the government pays back to you. I would have thought that was a pretty obvious proposition. When you look at the amount you pay to the government -  - However loudly he yells and interjects, it does not make him any more right. I would have thought it was an obvious proposition that, if you wanted to look at what somebody paid to the government, you had to net off what the government paid back by way of a grant, which is what the RACV failed to do. - Once one did that in relation to all of the RACV prices, as published in that newspaper, the fact of the matter was that they were paying less to the government in tax net grant than the metropolitan price quoted in relation to Melbourne. That was the obvious point, and it was a point that I would have thought was incontrovertibly proved. I have not seen anybody other than the member for Hotham try to dispute it. On different prices -  - That being the case, I will let you, Mr Speaker. - Thank you.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for the question. Obviously the exports that are going out of his particular part of Queensland are very important to the local economy, as are the excellent export results that are being achieved by Australia's exporters. The figures that were released for the month of July indicated that there has been an increase of two per cent in exports over the month of June this year and that July's figures this year are 27 per cent higher than those achieved in July 1999. The year to date total export effort out of Australia now stands at $128¼ billion compared to the 1998-99 financial year figure of $114 billion, which is a significant effort by Australia's exporters. Leading the way are rural exports out of all parts of Australia, which have increased by 12 per cent over June in 2000 and are actually up 23 per cent on July 1999. Transport equipment in the area of manufacturing has significantly increased - with the opportunities presented by new market access openings across the world, it has increased by 34 per cent over the previous month. Services exports rose by 26 per cent to $2.8 billion. I might add, a large part of that are educational services that we are exporting to the world. Last week, I had meetings in Indonesia with my counterpart in Indonesia, and the minister for education is doing a fantastic job in Australia in attracting university students from overseas into Australia. We have some 18,000 university students in Australia from Indonesia alone. Of course at this particular time of the year 2000, travel services exports have risen by 62 per cent, obviously in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. It is going to be a great export income generator in the Australian economy this year. So all in all it is a very, very good report card thus far this year for Australia's export industries, generating a significant percentage of our GDP in this country and a percentage that we want to see continue to increase because of the in excess of 1.7 million jobs that Australia's exporting industries sustain within our economy. This result is obviously the result of sound economic management by our government over a number of years as well as the pursuit of greater market access globally and as well as continued support programs such as the EMDG scheme that successive coalition governments including this one have supported and will continue to support into the future, which will continue to facilitate exports into the future.The question was asked: what are the threats to increased exports in the future? Quite obviously, the return to a Labor government would be a significant threat to the economy of Australia. We have not had a clear indication of economic policy by the Australian Labor Party in terms of what they are going to do with the sound measures that we have put into place which have underpinned the export effort Australians have taken advantage of. But, more importantly, some of the current threats to our exports and our relations with developing countries come from the real masters of the Australian Labor Party - and that is the union movement and those people like Mr Dougie Cameron of the AMWU, who ran a very strong debate against free and fair trade in Hobart, and I would imagine supported by some of the socialist left on the front bench -  -  - I am sure you supported him. I am sure that the shadow minister for finance supported him. Where do we expect Dougie Cameron to be next week? I am sure he will be outside the WEF, not inside. At least Sharan Burrow will be inside supporting the opportunity for increased trade and exports for Australian industries. I am sure Dougie Cameron will be outside marching with the protesters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The government has, it should be pointed out, retained the R&amp;D tax concessions at 125 per cent. They are still substantial. We have significantly expanded the use of targeted grants through the R&amp;D Start Program. We have significantly expanded the Technology Diffusion Program. We have increased support for business R&amp;D and innovation to some $850 million. As expected, changes to the R&amp;D system to remove rorts - so enthusiastically supported particularly by the shadow Treasurer! - have lowered the measured level of expenditure on research and development but substantially increased the proportion of genuine R&amp;D. We had had a system that had been subjected to ongoing abuse - ongoing rorting - and we wanted to clean that up.  In terms of the Miles report, yes, we have received the report from the Innovation Summit Implementation Group, which of course was chaired by Mr David Miles. We will also receive the first report of the science capability review in October. We recognise the importance of these things. We will be responding to them in due course, but I believe that the government's record is a sound one and we can be relied upon to ensure that Australia's R&amp;D needs in the future are met.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I am aware of those claims. In a speech in Townsville the Leader of the Opposition made the following assertion:You will find in regional Australia in particular access to GPs after hours has already disappeared.He went on:Doctors are not being properly remunerated to be able to provide those after hours services.These statements did not ring true and I had them checked out. It was somewhat difficult to analyse them by rural and remote classification, but I have been able to do it and I thought honourable members might be interested. The first thing to look at is the schedule fee for a general practitioner when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance in February 1996, on leaving government. A GP leaving his home and going to someone else's home at midnight would have a schedule fee of $46.20. If the Leader of the Opposition had this in his mind, I can understand why he would think GPs were not being properly remunerated. In fact, today the GP would get a schedule fee of $69.65, an increase of more than 50 per cent in four years. The fact is that the government introduced new item numbers for unsociable hours for general practice after-hours visits and this led to a very great increase in GPs' remuneration for after-hours services.The second thing that happens with after-hours services in rural and remote areas is that they access a thing called the Practice Incentive Program - and again I can understand the Leader of the Opposition not understanding this, because it was not available when he was last in government. A GP today can access an after-hours loading for being available or making available other doctors to cover their patients. - In the electorate of Herbert there are 113 doctors on the Practice Incentive Program and they get an average of $2,400 each just for the after-hours component of the Practice Incentive Program. In an electorate such as Dawson, the honourable member might be interested to know that in her electorate 146 doctors get an average of $3,060. - So here we have a schedule fee going up by more than 50 per cent and the Leader of the Opposition obviously apologising for the pathetic effort that he had when he was finance minister. As to the second point I would make, the Leader of the Opposition says that in some areas of regional Australia `access to GPs after hours has already disappeared'. Figures are hard to come by because the item number descriptors have changed but they have been constant since 1997. If you look at the number of GP after-hours services being billed in rural and remote Australia only - that is, RARMA classification 3 to 7 - in 1997 there were 143,000 services; in 1999-2000 158,500 services. So the number of GP after-hours services in the last two years has gone up 11 per cent.  - So here we have a Leader of the Opposition aimlessly wandering around the countryside, saying that we are not doing anythingwith not the vaguest clue what he is talking about. - My advice would be: if you ever want to talk about health again, get someone who knows what they are talking about. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question and indicate the great job that he is doing as the member for Menzies and the contribution that he makes in this place. It is well known that Australia has made a substantial contribution to regional economic stability through its assistance with IMF packages in Thailand and offers of assistance in Korea and Indonesia. This coming weekend another contribution which will be made is Australia's hosting of the World Economic Forum's Asia-Pacific summit, the first time to be held in Australia, for almost 1,000 world leaders from government and commerce who will be gathering in Melbourne. I think it is not only a good thing for Melbourne but a good thing for Australia. The summit is entitled `Asia-Pacific in the 21st century: leveraging the new drivers of growth'. It is apposite that this should be held in Australia because Australia has been recognised by the OECD as one of only six OECD economies which have been able to increase productivity and harness the new economy, the others being the United States, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. It was disciplined macro-economic settings, including a budget balanced and strong prudential regulation and institutions, that helped Australia survive the Asian financial crisis which claimed many of our neighbours.  I also pay tribute to the fact that there are indeed some members of the Labor Party who are taking part in the World Economic Forum. I think the Premier of Victoria is taking part in it. - He is okay because he is taking part in it. But I regret to say it is not all of the Australian Labor Party that supports the World Economic Forum. There are important elements of the Australian Labor Party which apparently are going to attack the World Economic Forum, as announced by Mr Doug Cameron, who says he is going along to demonstrate with the ACTU and the Trades Hall Council. The Trades Hall Council and the ACTU are no mere casual acquaintances of the Labor Party. The trade union movement formed the Labor Party and funds the Labor Party. It has 60 per cent of the votes in the Labor Party. The trade union movement owns the Labor Party, and the trade union movement apparently is going to be on the streets outside whilst members of the parliamentary Labor Party are on the inside taking part. Again, the Labor Party is walking both sides of the street, or in this case both sides of the barricade, opposing what will be a very important conference for Australia and for Melbourne. Perhaps even more worryingly, the S11 web site is now reporting that a branch meeting of the CFMEU on 13 July heard the state secretary announce that building workers would participate in the demo. These are building workers who pay dues to the Labor Party. The state secretary also endorsed the use of CFMEU first-aid representatives. The assistant secretary said he would organise a large marquee to be erected at the front of the Crown Towers to house the first-aid crew. One might well ask why the CFMEU are going down with a first-aid station to the World Economic Forum if they were not expecting trouble. Why would they be setting up a first-aid station if they were not expecting trouble? The CFMEU might say that is a false report on the S11 web site. If it is, I would call on the CFMEU leadership to say it is false, to distance themselves from the S11 web site and to make it clear that no constituent part of the Labor Party is going to be demonstrating against the World Economic Forum in Melbourne. I would go one further: I would call on the Leader of the Opposition to call on all the constituent parts of the Labor Party, including Mr Cameron and the CFMEU, and to make it clear that he as the leader of the Labor Party will not be brooking any demonstrations against this important event for Melbourne and Australia. A real leader would stand up and would make it clear. We saw yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition said he was going to suspend from caucus the member of the Left who made the statement about the toilet brush on the Titanic. He went about his search for the member of the Left with a blindfold and earmuffs on for the rest of the day. Today we had a member of the Right, which dobbed in the Left for making the statement, say, `There is a terrible slur on the Left today -  - This forum is an opportunity to get together -  - to promote economic growth, to raise living standards, which is not only in the interests of Australians but in the interests of the developing world, who are the biggest beneficiaries or amongst the beneficiaries of those who enter the international trading system. For people in Asia in particular over the last decade, it has been the entry of the newly industrialised economies of Asia into the world trading system and into the international trading system, with the foreign investment that that has brought, that has given them economic growth and the best chance they have had in centuries to raise their living standards.The World Economic Forum is an opportunity for people who are committed to economic growth to get together. It is the first time that it has been held outside of Europe. It is a big, positive stand both for Australia and for Melbourne. That is indicated by the fact that the Labor Party Premier of Victoria is going to be on the inside. What I cannot understand is why the paymasters of the Labor Party are going to be on the outside, and I cannot understand why the federal Labor Party leader cannot condemn them and call on them to call off those demonstrations. That would be leadership, that would show that he is truly committed to an international trading system and that would show that he is prepared to stand up to the union paymasters, as he ought to be doing in the national interest.</DOC>

 - We noticed what could only be described as a fairly transparent attempt, given the commitments you made about making the member for Fraser a member of cabinet should the unlikely happen and somehow or other you stumble into government. It was obviously meant in one way or another to repair some bridges, which I suspect have been very badly damaged in recent days between your side of politics and the indigenous people of this country - whom you proclaim so loudly that you care about and yet for whom your quite extraordinary contempt has been unveiled in recent days. - That is right. They are still there somewhere. We do not know who they are - they are certainly not putting their hands up. It is a bit like Mr Della Bosca. He discovered that you do not tell the truth if you want to go anywhere in the ALP. Let me make a couple of very important points about this. The first is that the minister responsible for reconciliation on our side - that is, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs - is a member of cabinet. The second point is that we have a stand-alone Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who is directly accountable to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister does take a very real and ongoing interest in these matters. The next point I would make is that there is probably no-one in this place who has spent as much time working with Aboriginal communities and who understands important issues like health more than the minister for health. The next point I would make is that, unlike you, we represent a lot of constituencies, particularly rural and regional constituencies, where there are many Aboriginal communities facing disadvantage and we are all actively involved in trying to meet their needs. Mr Speaker, I actually think your question reveals a great superficiality and is almost contemptible. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly want to say at the outset that I have no doubt that every member of this House would join with me in expressing sympathy to the families and loved ones of the victims. We are all deeply saddened to learn of the Beech Super King Air accident in Queensland. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the accident. Four investigators are currently at the crash site, and the bureau's investigation will be thorough, independent and incisive. It is, of course, far too early to know what caused the accident and I think it is timely to remind ourselves that early speculation about air accidents is very often wrong. The ATSB issued recommendations last year to CASA, which have been the subject of some comment. They also issued recommendations to the American Federal Aviation Administration and Raytheon, the manufacturers of the Beech aircraft, last year about the pressurisation of these aircraft. CASA and the FAA did not accept the recommendation about installing an audible warning system in the planes. I have told CASA and the ATSB today to urgently revisit the audible warning system issue as a way of improving the safety of these particular aircraft.To make some other points, there is an ongoing investigation into a Beech Super King Air pressurisation incident that occurred in June last year. In that case it was an aircraft being used by the military en route from Edinburgh in South Australia to Oakey, Queensland. They have not issued their final report on the incident. The report is due shortly, although it may be delayed because the person responsible for it will now be tied up for a while with the incident that took place yesterday morning. However, they did put out several interim recommendations last year. One of those recommendations went to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and, as I said, to the US Federal Aviation Administration and Raytheon, and that was that they should consider incorporating an audible warning system to operate in conjunction with the cabin altitude system on Beech aircraft and other similar aircraft. It did not make the recommendation just to CASA; it also made the recommendation to the US Federal Aviation Administration, which of course is recognised as the world's leading air safety regulator. CASA determined that they would await the outcome of two related recommendations before contemplating further action on the audible warning system. The FAA said, however, that an audible warning system was not warranted. They stated that, in their view, such a warning for the existing fleet was not considered necessary, and they went on to say that the existing visual warning system for high cabin altitude was deemed acceptable. In view of the public interest in the matter, I table that letter from the United States. I want to stress again that it is too early to know what caused this tragic incident. Honourable members who have followed other safety investigations will know that early speculation about accidents is often wrong. However, in view of the outstanding interim recommendation, I have told CASA and the ATSB to urgently revisit the audible warning system issue as a way of improving the safety of these aircraft. At the same time, I have told the agencies to keep the FAA and the manufacturers of the plane informed of the progress of the investigation into this week's accident. </DOC>

 - Of course, Mr Speaker, the last part of the question was absolutely wrong and just one of the tried and true tactics of trade union bosses who try to impugn the integrity of people - the old trade union trick which, of course, the member for Hotham has never risen above. - Yes, but if an aspersion is cast we are entitled to reject it. - The government's proposals to tax trusts like companies are due to commence on 1 July 2001. The government will be introducing legislation to that effect. Of course, we would expect the Australian Labor Party to vote for it so we do not expect any difficulty in passing it through the parliament. In response to the allegations put forward by the member for Hotham: was the Labor Party not in office for 13 years? Did it ever introduce this legislation? Did the Labor Party, after 13 years of office, ever do anything on this issue? Here is the Labor Party, after 13 years of masterly inactivity, suddenly interested in this particular issue. We know that it is just hypocrisy. We know that this is an allegation which is thrown by a group of people who had no ability to do anything in this area. We know this is another area where the coalition must lead and, when we lead, we expect the Labor Party to follow. </DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. I recognise the great interest she shows on behalf of the people of Hindmarsh, particularly with regard to human rights issues nationally and internationally. It is a very genuine concern. A few hours ago, the Prime Minister met with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. The Prime Minister and Mr Annan discussed a number of topics. Among those topics was the Australian government's position on the United Nations human rights treaty committee system. The Prime Minister took the opportunity of saying to the Secretary-General that Australia had no quarrel with the United Nations human rights goals and objectives. He made it perfectly clear, nevertheless, that Australia is unhappy with the way the treaty committee system works and believes that the system needs very substantial reform. I think it is fair to say, from my conversation with the Prime Minister, that the Secretary-General was interested and happy with what the Prime Minister said, and he responded that no part of the United Nations is immune from criticism and no part of the United Nations is immune from reform.  The discussion between the Prime Minister and the Secretary General was a constructive discussion, and I regard it as a useful early contact in Australia's campaign to achieve reform of the United Nations Human Rights Committee system. A number of others over the last few days have expressed their support for reform of that system. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, has supported the objective of reform, and a number of member states have, frankly, for many years been working towards reform. Insofar as other people's views on this issue are concerned, I noticed yesterday in a press conference that the Leader of the Opposition said:We have the detailed policies in now from all the shadow ministers. All the policies are now in. Were an election to be called this year, we would be ready to fight it. -  - Why is this relevant to this question? It is relevant to this -  - I am going to help you out here. It is relevant to this question because one of the numerous comments made recently by the opposition spokesman for foreign affairs has been that he supports reform of the United Nations Human Rights Committee system. So the Labor Party apparently - of course - oppose what the government have been saying and expresses outrage at the totally atrocious position of the Howard government but all the time run around saying that they support reform of the Human Rights Committee system. What reforms do the Labor Party support? Name one reform articulated in your policies - which are apparently sitting in the Leader of the Opposition's drawer. The simple fact is that the Labor Party says they support reform, but they never say what reform they support. Of course, it is exactly the Labor Party's tactic to walk both sides of the street, to tell every constituency in the country precisely what they want to hear. How weak is that!</DOC>

 - Again, the member for Wills makes a false assertion in his question. It works on the principle that if he states a false assertion then some people might be beguiled into thinking it were fact. The Australian Taxation Office has always made it clear - and I think the honourable member should be aware of it - that those abusive employee share schemes which it is worried about and which it considers to be against the law are being prosecuted in the courts. The Taxation Office is prosecuting them in the courts under part IVA, which was introduced to prevent contrived schemes. If I am right, I think part IVA was actually introduced under a coalition government.  - It was introduced by the coalition government to deal with avoidance schemes and it empowers the tax office to attack a contrived scheme and empowers the courts to declare it down. That is a matter which the commissioner has briefed counsel on and which he is taking proceedings on.   - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition volubly interjects again. I presume he would prefer that the courts were not able to enforce the law. - In a democratic society - if I can go through the principle - the parliament makes the law and the courts interpret it. The law in this case -  - I will go through it from first principles. The parliament makes the laws and the courts enforce them. In this case the law the parliament made was that part IVA would hit paper schemes - this was introduced by a coalition government. The tax commissioner prosecutes, the courts interpret the law and, if the tax commissioner wins, as he believes he will, the courts will then determine that more tax is payable. If you were to suspend the operation of the courts you could do that, but I doubt that a party that believes in human rights as strongly as the Australian Labor Party does would want to suspend the operation of the courts or the enforcement of the law. The tax commissioner's position has always been that he will be enforcing the law, that part IVA is there for that purpose. The allegation in the question, notwithstanding the fact that it is repeated, does not make it a fact. The premise is wrong and the commissioner is enforcing the law.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I appreciate the interest he shows in the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia. As the House knows, the government regards our relationship with Indonesia as one of our most important bilateral relationships and, as the House also knows, that relationship has been through a difficult period as a result of events in East Timor last year.  Nevertheless, during this year there have been numerous contacts between this government and the government of Indonesia. The latest of those contacts was a meeting between the Prime Minister and President Wahid of Indonesia yesterday in New York. At this meeting both the Prime Minister and President Wahid recognised the good progress Australia and Indonesia have made in their trade and economic relationships. It is worth reporting that President Wahid welcomed our highly constructive approach, as indeed the Australian government welcomes the highly constructive approach of President Wahid. President Wahid said that he shared Australia's deep concern about militia activity on the East-West Timor border and indicated that he would do all he could in this regard. He also underlined the need for repatriation and resettlement of refugees. We regard this matter as particularly important in the context of security in East Timor, the future direction of East Timor and the security of our very own Australian citizens working as civilian police, peacekeepers and in other capacities in East Timor. I know the House will be interested in this. President Wahid proposed a quadrilateral meeting involving Australia, Indonesia, East Timor and Portugal to further cooperation on East Timor. Certainly that is a suggestion that this government believes is constructive. We look forward to the meeting taking place before too long. President Wahid also agreed -  this is a matter of great concern to the government in our international dealings - that oil prices were currently too high and that international oil prices should be stabilised at around $US25 per barrel, which is more or less the view of the OPEC countries.  President Wahid raised his desire to visit Australia in the second half of October. He also proposed that the ministerial forum which is planned for this year between Australian and Indonesian ministers, to be held in Australia, be held before the presidential visit. Therefore, we would be looking at this ministerial forum possibly being held in the first two weeks or so of October. Let me hasten to add that the quadrilateral meeting that was proposed by President Wahid would take place after the visit to Australia, President Wahid's proposition being one that we warmly embrace. This meeting demonstrates the great importance of our bilateral relationship with Indonesia and the positive steps that both countries are now taking to revitalise that relationship and advance our cooperation across a whole range of areas. I am confident that over the next few weeks the relationship will get back onto a sound footing. </DOC>

 - If somebody was lobbying for a tax avoidance scheme in 1999, obviously they were unsuccessful, weren't they? I would have thought that even your tactics committee would have been able to tell that there was no legislative change subsequent to 1999 in this area, which was the point of the last question. If you had thought about it, you would have realised that in 1999 there was no prospect whatsoever.  - As I said in response to the last question in this area, it was as a result of contrived schemes in the 1980s that the then government - I believe it was the now Prime Minister - introduced part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was to my knowledge never amended in 13 years of Labor government. Part IVA was a general anti-avoidance legislative provision which could be used to attack contrived schemes.  - So a contrived scheme of any kind or other can be attacked under part IVA as an avoidance measure. It is attacked by the commissioner through the courts. Those schemes which the commissioner believes are contrived avoidance schemes are being attacked through the courts by the commissioner under part IVA, which was the legislative provision put in place to deal with this. If they are contrived schemes - and that is a matter for the courts - they will be struck down under part IVA and the courts will decide they are contrary to law.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I do see reports from time to time of proposed changes to Australia's tax system. They go under the name of roll-back - a word which the Leader of the Opposition has not uttered since 16 July and a word which has not been uttered by the opposition in this parliament since 1 July this year. While we are on the subject of tax avoidance, I make the point that the most significant crackdown on the black economy in Australia's history was the introduction of the goods and services tax. The most significant crackdown on the black economy in Australia's history - the goods and services tax - was opposed by the Labor Party. Because of the goods and services tax, which is now not only making people pay tax as they buy but also with the Australian business number bringing firms into the tax system for the first time, and because of the good work of the coalition, those honest Australians who have always been paying their tax are now finding the black economy is being picked up. The people of Australia are grateful that the Labor Party's campaign did not succeed.Are there alternative policies to the current taxation system? Apparently there are because yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was asked:Down at your ALP conference you said the detailed policies would be ready in three weeks. Are they ready now? Are you ready to fight an election?BEAZLEY: We have the detailed policies in now from all shadow ministers.Presumably, roll-back has been sent in by the shadow Treasurer, who has been working hard on roll-back, to the Leader of the Opposition. If that is the case, as was said yesterday, we ask one simple question: why don't you release it? The people of Australia are entitled to see the roll-back policy which is now sitting with the Leader of the Opposition. He said on 23 February 2000:... people are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we're going. They're also entitled to know exactly what we'd do in the next term of government with a GST ... People are entitled to know it and not be deceived.The roll-back policy is now with the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition says people are entitled to know what it is. Why will the Leader of the Opposition not release this afternoon the roll-back policy so that the people of Australia can know where he stands on the GST? As he said, the people of Australia are entitled to know it and not be deceived.There is a new socialist frontbencher in the industry portfolio, which has now gone to the Socialist Left. - Yes, I said that yesterday. Socialist Left in industry, Socialist Left in finance and an ACTU boss in Treasury - that is Labor's economic team. You have heard of Four Weddings and a Funeral; this is two socialists and a shop steward - Labor's economic team. -  - They enjoy it. As the socialists go around the boardrooms of Australia led by their shop steward, they can be disclosing their policy. Now with the Leader of the Opposition is the famous policy of roll-back. From this side of parliament can I also say that we are very anxious to see roll-back too. We would like to see the roll-back policy as much as the people of Australia. It is with you; now, Leader of the Opposition, it is up to you. </DOC>

 - Again it is the tactic of stating a false premise in a question with the hope that, if you state it often enough, you could at least convince the Labor Party backbench, if not those who understand. As I said in answer to the last two questions, the advice of the Commissioner of Taxation is that those schemes which are avoidance schemes are contrary to part IVA, and part IVA will be enforced through the courts. I am also asked about a policy that the Australian Labor Party had in 1994 which was to wipe out all employee share schemes by applying fringe benefits tax to all employee share schemes. Not only was that policy defeated in the Senate but the Australian Labor Party conceded it was wrong and then came back with a new policy which allowed some employee share schemes. We only have to ask ourselves the obvious question: how could that legislation have been defeated in the Senate on the votes of the coalition alone? - What? Relevance? - I was also asked about measures which, back in 1994 as I recall, were defeated in the Senate, and I was coming directly to that point. How could they have been defeated in the Senate on the votes of the coalition alone? No, they were not. They were defeated in the Senate on the votes of the coalition and the now Labor member for Dickson, who stated in the Senate, quite rightly, that the proposal to apply fringe benefits tax to all employee share schemeswhich would have made illegal every employee share scheme or rather would have made it, from a tax point of view, uncommercial to have any employee share schemewas an attempt to use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, which was the view of the coalition. To put fringe benefits tax on every employee share scheme was taking a sledgehammer to a walnut and would have made it impossible to have employee share schemes in Australia. No; a much better way of doing things was to allow legitimate employee share schemes. And I must say, from the coalition's point of view, we actually want to encourage employee share schemes. We want to encourage them, and we were not going to let the Australian Labor Party wipe them all out in 1994 under misguided socialist principles. The way in which those ones which were contrived or abusive could and should be handled would be under part IVA. The advice of the taxation commissioner was that they would be prosecuted through the courts, which is what will happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I am able to advise the House that a report is now available which gives a detailed assessment of the operation of the Workplace Relations Act in respect of agreement making in the last couple of years, in particular over the period 1998-99. This gives the parliament the first and most comprehensive advice on the operation of agreement making. It gives some detail which has not as yet been able to be provided to members. Members know that we have been able to create 800,000 jobs or thereabouts, productivity is the best it has been for 30 years and wages have been rising, particularly for low income people. The member for New England will be interested to know that when you look at the details of the agreement making you can see how the system is working to provide real benefits, particularly to workers.For example, what it shows is that family friendly provisions in collective agreements have been available in something like 76 per cent of all agreements. That shows you the flexibility of the system. It is becoming more comprehensive. I would hope that there would be wide support for that, although I would have to say from the noises being made by the opposition that it is clear that they would like to get rid of a lot of those options available for workers. The non-union or collective agreements, which we describe as `direct agreements' between employers and employees, have been widely used and there are real benefits for workers there. One in five in the private sector are in a union, but the non-union collective agreement provides a choice for people who are not in a union, which is about 80 per cent of that private sector work force.I am asked if there are any alternative policies. I was amazed to hear the Leader of the Opposition, after he had been telling us for ages we would not have any policies till next year because `you could not have a policy until close to the election; otherwise they would not be relevant', finally say yesterday that he has actually received a whole lot of policies - in fact, from all of his shadow ministers. He says, `We have the detailed policies in now from all the shadow ministers.' All the policies are now in. This is good news for the small business community - the shadow minister for small business has finally produced a policy and it is with the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow minister for industrial relations has finally produced a policy - this is incredible news - and it is with the Leader of the Opposition. And from the shadow minister for employment, the long lost, missing employment policy, often promised, has finally arrived. It is now with the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think it would take much now. We are getting close. It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition has got these policies. I presume he has got them in his basement. He is the only one with the key. All we say to him is, `Why don't you let us into your policies?' For people who have signed non-union agreements, I do not think there is any doubt the Labor Party is going to get rid of those agreements. The Leader of the Opposition has a policy. I think people are entitled to see it. I say to the shadow ministers: don't be shy about your policies. If you believe in your policies you should be proud of your policies and you should want to have the time to go out and show people how good they are. I know the Leader of the Opposition has had a bad week, as the Treasurer demonstrated yesterday. He is still looking for the person who made the remarks about the indigenes, or trying to hear about the person it might have been. He at least now has these policies. Don't hide your light under a bushel. Get the key out. Go down to the basement. Don't bring up the mushrooms, bring out the policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. It is pleasant to have the member for Fremantle back on the frontbench; we have the benefit of her wisdom again. But the member for Fremantle also has a track record in this area, and we should be prepared to look at it when she is making comments on the government's health policy. Yesterday during her media conference in relation to the government's position on the 30 per cent rebate the member for Fremantle said, `The decision has been made and we move on.' The decision she must have been talking about was Labor's decision to roll back the 30 per cent rebate, thereby increasing premiums for older people and leading to a decline in private health insurance. But we can hardly move on while the Labor Party are not prepared to give details of it and think they are going to surf into government and hide this one. The fact is that there are eight million Australians who are going to be disadvantaged by this particular decision. The member for Fremantle also claimed:I mean, I am very concerned, for instance, that the government hasn't the necessary energy or interest in the public health system.She went on to say:We are about adding value to Medicare, not rebuilding it. We can have a look at the member for Fremantle's record in this area. After all, she was health minister for two years, between March 1994 and March 1996. When the member for Fremantle was health minister under a Labor government, Australia ranked third last in the Western world for childhood immunisation. Rather than address the problem, she used the issue as leverage in Commonwealth-state funding negotiations. There was a complete lack of coordination between the Commonwealth and states on Aboriginal health matters. - There were 38 Aboriginal communities of over 200 people with no access to health care whatsoever and no plans for such services. Doctor numbers in rural Australia were in decline, and Labor's answer was to establish a committee. The cost of Medicare was spiralling out of control and, rather than deal with it, the member for Fremantle and the then Minister for Finance increased the Medicare levy, having denied that they would do so. Fourteen hundred people a day were leaving private health insurance. The honourable member asked about the government's commitment to these areas, and it is very clear. We have increased funding to public hospitals by $6 billion over five years, dramatically improved immunisation levels, turned around private health insurance and increased funding to Aboriginal health in a way that has never happened before in this country. We have made the single largest commitment to rural health ever and brought important issues like mental health, diabetes, asthma and Aboriginal health under the umbrella of Medicare - something Labor failed to do. Bulk-billing rates today are higher than they were under Labor, doctors are more appropriately remunerated for after-hours work and Medicare Easyclaim facilities give people very substantially increased access to Medicare.Perhaps the area where there is the greatest contrast in what the member for Fremantle raised yesterday was lecturing the government on research and development. For two years the member for Fremantle was responsible for research and development in the National Health and Medical Research Council. The member for Fremantle oversaw an increase in funding in the 1994 budget. There was a very specific commitment given, that the level of funding was consistent with the commitment to lift health and medical research to two per cent of the total health expenditure by the year 2000. I have sat on five expenditure review committees and I know that you make a very major decision, when you have new funding, as to whether it is short term or long term. In spite of the specific commitments in the 1994 budget for health and medical research, these were four-year commitments and their funding dropped off in mid-1998. So what you had is the National Health and Medical Research Council making three- to five-year funding commitments on the basis of funding they were led to believe was continuing but which dropped off in mid-1998 in a smoke and mirrors trick. This was something that the government had to address when it came into government, something that was difficult to find the money to plug, and it shows that when it comes to an issue of innovation - and the only track record we have for the member for Fremantle is in this area - the money ran out in mid-1998, the National Health and Medical Research Council was in crisis and they remember very well the sort of commitment that they got from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, could I say how many cases were instituted by the tax commissioner in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000? No, of course I could not. Would anybody be expected to know how many cases the commissioner had brought? No, of course they would not. -  - But who would decide whether or not to bring cases in the courts to enforce the law? The tax commissioner - the Commissioner of Taxation, who is an independent statutory officer vested with the responsibility of enforcing the law; the same Commissioner of Taxation whose advice is that abusive employee share schemes are contrary to part IVA and should be prosecuted in the courts. - Does the commissioner have control over the court lists? Would he be frustrated by court delays? Most probably he would. But can the Commissioner of Taxation jump the court lists? He cannot. Has the commissioner been given full resources to prosecute these matters in the courts? Yes, he has. The government has authorised a special counsel, who has been advising in relation to a number of these matters, at the request of the Commissioner of Taxation so that he has full resources. Why do the Labor Party get interested in this today? - I will make a prediction - because they know I am going to the APEC finance ministers meeting tomorrow, and they will stand up tomorrow and they will say, `Where is he? He's not here to answer questions.' It is the same as when I went off to the OECD: they had thousands of questions they wanted to ask me the moment I left and when I came back - not one question. So much for all of these questions that they said they would have wanted to ask! So they find out in their tactics meeting - `Oh, the Treasurer's going up to the APEC finance ministers meeting on Thursday; let's ask a whole lot of questions and then on Thursday we can get up and say, 'Where is he? He's not here to answer the questions.' ' In relation to the employee share schemes -  - As I said earlier, does the government support employee share schemes? Yes, it does. Does it believe that fringe benefits tax should be used to wipe them out? No, it does not. Does it believe that, if there are abusive schemes, action should be taken? Yes, it does. Has it received advice? Yes, it has. If its advice is that those abusive schemes have been contrary to part IVA and should be prosecuted under part IVA, who has the responsibility for bringing actions in the court?  The Commissioner of Taxation. I also table the minority report in relation to the 1994 legislation. It starts off by saying:I wish to dissent from the recommendation of the Committee ... During these hearings, the Government had failed to identify the exact nature of the abuses of the current taxation law. As a matter of policy, these abuses should have been dealt with using specific anti-avoidance measures rather than through a further inappropriate extension of the Fringe Benefits tax.It concludes by saying this:While it is clear that some anti-avoidance measures will be needed to supplement ... 26AAC and part IVA, the proposed legislation appears to be a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.I table it. It was the report of former Senator Kernot, now the Labor member for Dickson. Unless the Labor Party wants to allege that that was evidence of some kind of connivance in tax avoidance, it was the same view that the coalition took at the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question, and I acknowledge his very great interest in indigenous education and Aboriginal affairs generally. This government is strongly committed to the right of all parents to choose their own school, to get schooling for their children which reflects their values and their cultural background. The Labor Party at the moment is under huge pressure from the Australian Education Union to vote against education choice. It has found a spokesman in this House in the member for Port Adelaide, whose views about choice have been put clearly on the record on behalf of the Australian Education Union. The member for Port Adelaide said: Choice in its raw form means segregation, not freedom. ... It has nothing to do with freedom.He says that increasing parental choice will deprive `children who live in socioeconomically depressed areas and children in rural Australia'. Nothing refutes more clearly these absurd remarks than the Aboriginal community controlled schools. There are some 26 of these schools, and they are often the only option that young indigenous students have in remote and traditional areas. - Mr Speaker, I thank you for your ruling and of course I would not anticipate debate. The point I am making in response to the question is that Aboriginal community controlled schools show the value of choice to the most disadvantaged members of the community. The annual reports on these schools show that they consistently show high levels of indigenous employment. They show indigenous input into curriculum design and implementation, and involvement in decision making. They also help non-indigenous staff to understand the needs of indigenous students. That is the value of educational choice, which is a general policy principle that this government is strongly committed to. The government's attitude to indigenous matters is very different to that of the Labor Party. As the question asked, I am aware of other comments. The opposition leader should get serious in trying to find out who on his frontbench made those comments about indigenous affairs. Yesterday I thought that the member for Dobell had narrowed the matter to the Left.   - Mr Speaker, the question specifically asked me about comments on Aboriginal affairs, and I am now making reference to comments on Aboriginal affairs. I was just saying that we had comments which pointed to particular members of the Labor frontbench who had made those comments. Last night on the 7.30 Report -  - The question asked me specifically whether I had heard comments on Aboriginal affairs. On the 7.30 Report last night the new shadow minister for indigenous affairs made these comments:It's a passing thing but it's a shocking thing - that is, these comments that had apparently come from the frontbench of the Labor Party - but people eventually will judge me on whether I do a good job or not, not whether some idiot made a mistake the day before I took it.</DOC>

I make the observation that we have indicated that we will respond fully and properly in due course, once we have had an opportunity to consider what has been put before us. I cannot help taking the opportunity, though, to add to my earlier comments in response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition and in making some remarks that go to the matter of the new shadow minister's capacity to deliver in cabinet. I can only say that I sincerely hope the outcomes she achieves in future are better than those which happened the last time she went to her colleagues, in 1994, seeking an expansion of some $800 million expenditure on Aboriginal health. On that particular occasion she was stymied by an interesting collection of people. At the time, Minister Howe thought that the submission was sloppy and he was strongly backed by Crean - interestingly enough - Beazley and Baldwin. In other words -  </DOC>

 - This week, after considerable consultation with the forest industries, this government has increased the matching funding for research and development in the forest products industry to the national primary industry standard of dollar for dollar of industry levies. Such research moneys are desperately needed from the plantation sector right through to the manufacturing sector of the industry. There has been an anomaly in this particular funding because historically the amount of funding provided has been 50 cents in the dollar and the cap that that could go to, which is 0.5 per cent of GVP in other industries, was also 0.25 per cent. There was a reason for that - that is, the Labor Party made that decision. At a time when the new shadow minister for industry and innovation was a member of cabinet, the Labor Party decided that research into the forestry sector was worth only a pittance, worth only half the money. And she comes in here and asks questions about our commitment!Furthermore, yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry launched the strategies associated with management of the Murray-Darling Basin salinity problem. Those sorts of projects do not come to fruition without substantial expenditure in research and appropriate issues. More importantly, as recognised publicly by scientists, a new form of technology has been developed by government agencies which I choose to call the `ultrasound of the earth'. Through research, we have created a new technology which tells us where the salt is, how deep it is under the ground, in which direction it is flowing and how much is there. That represents expenditure and outcome but, further, it will save billions of dollars to be diverted to other needy causes because we now know where to address our funding in this regard. That is an outcome. It is vastly different from the new shadow minister's idea that you can measure excellence by expenditure. That is all she is on about: spend the money and do not care where it goes. Of course, her leader will borrow the money for her, as he has in the past.There are some grave issues arising from this. We do need research in industry, we do need contributions from industry and we do need cooperation from government. What encouragement do industries and other people have when we now have an shadow industry minister who hates industry, a shadow knowledge minister who has amnesia and a shadow spokesperson for women who has taken dreadful action against a woman in my state? </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his somewhat predictable question. As usual, you cannot take at face value his interpretation of what others have said. It is true that a member of the Victorian branch of my party has made some comments about the concern in rural areas about high fuel prices, but the first and foremost point that I want to raise is that he has acknowledged, the member opposite might like to know, that to a very great extent the concerns in rural and regional areas about the differential between country and city prices has eased. He said that. And for some unknown reason, the member who asked the question chose not to refer to those comments. I am not quite sure why! Quite simply, the National Party's position on this is on the record; the coalition's position is on the record. Our position is quite firm. You attempt to continue -  - I repeat the point that there is an attempt by the member who asked the question, the shadow Treasurer, to misrepresent the claims made by the president of the Victorian branch of the National Party. He actually said that concern has moved from the fact that there is a discrepancy between country and city fuel prices to an overall concern about high fuel prices. We all share that. But there is one thing we do: we move around, people talk to us and we listen to their concerns about fuel prices. As we talk to those who have an understanding of the issue, there is one thing that we do not do - and that is to accept any authority, moral or otherwise, from the ALP on the question of petrol pricing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and recognise the interest that he has had for quite some time in the situation in both East and west Timor. The government deplores the tragic turn of events in Atambua yesterday, when armed militia attacked the United Nations High Commission for Refugees officers and set fire to offices and destroyed them. At least three UNHCR staff have been killed, and many others have been injured. I can inform the House that there were no Australians among the dead or injured. The attacks and the rioting were sparked by a funeral procession for a murdered militia leader.  The activities of the militias in west Timor are doing enormous damage, and I know that the international community is at one in urging the Indonesian government to take further steps to bring the militias under control. We welcome the decision by the Indonesian government today to send two additional battalions to west Timor to endeavour to bring the militias under control, and we very much hope that this measure will be effective. There is no doubt that there are particular individuals in these militias who are leading them and who are endeavouring to create a maximum of damage and destruction in west Timor, as well as organising raids into East Timor from west Timor. Amongst those people, one of the best known is Eurico Guterres. This is somebody who the Indonesians must make every effort to bring to justice. Over 40 international and local staff from the UNHCR and other organisations were airlifted by the United Nations peacekeeping organisation to East Timor yesterday, and the evacuations from west Timor will continue today. The Australian government has also withdrawn Australian aid project staff from west Timor. I have also ensured that the consular travel advice be amended. Australians are urged to defer all travel to west Timor until further notice and a consular team from Jakarta is now travelling to Kupang. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will be writing to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata, to convey our sincere condolences for those who have died.This appalling incident underlines the seriousness of the security situation. As we have made clear many times, the government of Indonesia is responsible for providing effective security and ending militia activity in west Timor, including disarming and disbanding militias and bringing to justice those who have committed crimes. The Prime Minister has underlined his concerns to President Wahid in the last 24 hours. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, will be raising our concerns with the Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security Affairs, Bambang Yudhoyono, in Jakarta during today and raising those same concerns with Vice President Megawati tomorrow. I reiterated our concerns in a discussion I had earlier today with the Indonesian ambassador. As I have said already, we do welcome the advice from the Indonesians that they are sending two additional battalions, which will constitute about 1,200 troops into west Timor, in order to endeavour to bring the situation more effectively under control.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that all people in this place are concerned to ensure that we can establish the cause of this accident as soon as possible. It is not yet established and, as I commented in this place yesterday, premature judgments about the causes of aviation accidents are always unwise because they very often are proved to be wrong.As usual, one should be very careful about claims made by those opposite. I have no idea what sort of audible warning system you would get for $2,000. My advice is that there are a number of questions that would have to be resolved about the type of audible warning system that might be fitted. The switching, whether or not it relied on the same switch as the current lighting or on visible signs and a whole range of things of that order would have to be considered before a determination was made about the type of audible warning device that was fitted and then what it might cost.  As is his want, the  member opposite has apparently become something of an overnight expert in this matter and now understands it inside out. What I said in this House and tabled yesterday and what has been said since has made it quite evident that there is a surprising divergence of views amongst experts on this matter. The standard applied to aircraft of this sort is FAA23, oversighted in the United States where the safety regulator, the FAA, is -  - I would have thought, by any measure, assuming only that the questioner is interested in the facts of the matter and not some cheap and ghoulish attempt to be political. It reflects extraordinarily poorly on this individual who understands far better the art of personal vilification than he does serious policy debate. The simple fact is that there is a considerable divergence of opinion among the experts on this matter. In fact, we had an interim report issued in about October last year. A number of interim recommendations were made - the report did not only cover this matter. Some recommendations were acted upon. This particular one went to the FAA, to the manufacturers of the aeroplane and to CASA. The FAA's attitude was reflected in the letter I tabled yesterday. The manufacturer indicated that they did not want to move at that time. CASA indicated that they would await further consultation and the finalisation of the ATSB's report, which in fact was due today, I think, but is likely to be postponed because of the further accident. This particular matter - I have no intention of trying to mislead on this matter - was not brought to my attention until the accident took place. It was under active consideration by the experts in the field. That is the way we have set up aviation safety in this country. I do not purport for a moment to be an expert on aviation safety matters in terms of technical expertise. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: did you proclaim yourself to be an expert in technical matters relating to aviation safety? Did Laurie Brereton? Did any of those opposite? In fact, you yourselves set up what I regard as a broadly appropriate approach whereby as minister I am responsible for the oversighting of the good governance of aviation safety and we rightly employ independent experts to form judgments on these matters. We have seen a tragic loss of life here. I suggest to those opposite that they do not fall into the mistake of sounding ghoulish while we attempt to find out what caused this tragedy and what might be done to limit the further opportunity for them to happen. Again, I remind you that there are some 2,000 of these aircraft flying around the world and they have a very good safety record. In due course, as I have indicated must now happen, there will be a proper consideration of the differences of opinion among the experts on this and they must resolve those differences.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The ABS released the latest unemployment figures today. They are very good numbers. Members might remember that last month jobs growth indicated a fantastic number of 70,000 or so. My expectation, from a layman's point of view, was that with the volatility of the monthly numbers there would be some fall back this month, but today's figures show that the numbers have been very strong. Seasonally adjusted employment grew by a very solid 24,100 jobs, which has seen the unemployment rate move up marginally by 0.1 of a percentage point - from 6.3 per cent to 6.4 per cent - but that is against a backdrop of a rising participation rate. In fact, the participation rate went up by 0.2 of a percentage point to 64.1 per cent. This is equal to the highest participation rate recorded since the monthly labour force survey began in February 1978.  - I note the interjection. I would not want to respond to the member personally because that would contravene standing orders, but the fact is that on average - over the time that we have been in, compared with the last six years of the Labor Party - the participation rate under us has been higher than what it was under Labor. We have just notched up a record figure, and still they interject. They should not be interjecting. They ought to be voting for the further reforms in the Senate, which would help small business, so we can drive the unemployment numbers lower. What a pathetic response. This is a record number. Why is it a record number? Because we are a government, committed to helping business - particularly small business - which goes out and creates the jobs.In respect of young people, there are fewer teenagers unemployed and looking for full-time work than at any time since the monthly survey began in February 1978. These are excellent numbers. Average annual jobs growth under us, on that same basis, has been 188,700. When Labor was in, it was only 70,600. Annual percentage jobs growth under Labor was 0.9 per cent. Under us it is 2.2 per cent - more than double Labor's performance. This demonstrates good government and good policies - and great results for the average person. - Will they last! The Labor Party, when they were last in government, gave us the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. Who was the minister for employment? None other than the Leader of the Opposition. I conclude by saying that you have to have policies. If you do not have policies, these are the sorts of things people will say about you. This is what somebody once said about not having policies. They said:A policy vacuum hiding a mound of deceit - deceit which conceals a set of prejudices, not policies; prejudices aimed at the ordinary Australian working man and woman. You deserve dismissal and censure ...So said this person, about a party which he claimed did not have policies. Who said that? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, who has no policies. He said a couple of days ago that his frontbench - the weakest frontbench since World War II - has finally produced some policies, which are all sitting in the basement with the mushrooms. What are you going to do with them for 12 months? What are you going to feed these policies on? We think it is time these policies came out. We say on this side that 6.4 per cent and 20,000-odd jobs this month is a good number, but we say that, in a country as rich in resources as Australia, we ought to do better on the unemployment front. This government has policies. It is time that those sitting opposite produced a few policies and showed that they have an alternative. They either have no policies, or they must be frightened to expose them. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition had a bit of policy oomph and produced one just for once.</DOC>

 - Let me confirm for the member for Batman again that I have given him an absolutely forthright answer on when I became aware of it. I believe that my office became aware of the particular reasons that CASA put forward for withholding a final decision until the final report came through from the ATSB a little before I did. I am not quite certain what point the member opposite is trying to establish but, again, I would simply point out to you that we have here a situation where the people involved are charged with enormous responsibility to make recommendations - in this case an interim recommendation was made - to the manufacturer of the aeroplanes and to the world's biggest and most powerful regulator, the FAA in America. Both of them regarded it as unnecessary to move. CASA indicated that: ... before imposing such a condition on operators, extensive consultation would need to be undertaken. The authority will await the outcome of two considerations - without giving the letters, they are on the record anyway - before contemplating further action on this matter.I repeat that I and, as you would appreciate, my office are not charged with the responsibility of being the technical experts in this matter. It is as simple as that. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I simply conclude my remarks by saying that it is my understanding that my office became aware of the particulars of this situation shortly after the accident. I became aware of it at around midday on that day. But it should be remembered that many sensitive issues are raised with me concerning both airline companies and disputes over regulations. This was not. Up until this last very unfortunate accident, CASA's view was that `this incident' - that of June last year involving the plane that flew from Edinburgh in South Australia to Oakey in Queensland - `does not provide sufficient justification' - in their view - `to mandate retro-fitting of audible cabin altitude warning.' There was no reason to have foreseen - and I do not believe it would have been reasonable to have asked that of anybody - that the tragic set of circumstances that has evolved would have reignited this debate.But, again, I make what I think is a very important point: we do not know the cause of the accident. The outrageous assumption made by a member of the ALP in the Senate yesterday that the evidence seems to suggest - and he put it perhaps even more strongly than that - that the fitting of this device might have saved lives is premature. We do not know what caused the accident. There are no grounds whatsoever at this point in time for saying that lives might have been saved - we would all have liked to have seen those lives saved - had there been an audible warning system. And I again indicate that, in the interests of being fair and reasonable, and indeed out of respect for those who have lost lives, encouraging irresponsible and unnecessary speculation along these lines is not helpful. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Over the last 4½ years or so we have been about providing strong leadership, which, of course, produces a better and more secure future for people who live in rural and regional Australia. It is a difficult time in rural and regional areas here, and indeed right across the world, as people cope with change. But our approaches have been delivering. This is in stark contrast to the Leader of the Opposition who, for all of his chest beating about his concerns for rural and regional Australia, failed to find time to even mention regional issues in his keynote address in Tasmania. He could not find the time to mention rural, regional and remote Australians and their needs in his keynote address in Tasmania.In comparing what we have been doing as a government with the ALP's approach, I have to make the comment at the outset that we do not know yet what they do. We are told they have a policy. It is in the top drawer; it is ready to be released. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, says that there is one and we therefore assume that Mr Ferguson has produced it, or has at least provided it to him. Hopefully, this is something that we can rely upon, as we all recall that the member for Dickson was for a very long time about to produce a rural and regional policy. We heard week after week that we were about to get a rural and regional policy. Of course, it never really happened. When the member for Batman became the shadow minister responsible in this area, he found the cupboard bare - there wasn't one. I can only say that I hope we do not find that we get a repetition of that, and that these promises that all policies are there just waiting to be released do not prove to be empty yet again.In the absence of any clear policy at all from the Labor Party in relation to rural and regional Australia, we will have to go on their form - we will have to look at what they have done. We could start with our very important economic reforms in this country starting when we began 4½ years ago to wind back the economic mess that we had inherited. The Labor Party, of course, denied that there was any such thing as the Beazley black hole. We found that the Labor Party opposed every move we took to wean ourselves off their bankcard binge. As we sought to get inflation and interest rates back under control, we found that they were against every measure we took. Then, of course, there was tax. We saw tax reform as vital for rural and regional Australia and so did bodies like the National Farmers Federation. They saw it as important to remove $3½ billion worth of indirect taxes on our exports. They were particularly keen to see what is now a $2.2 billion reduction in taxes on transport fuel. They are also, of course, very committed to the $500 million that we have put into easing the differential between country and city fuel prices. Again, what might the ALP's approach be to this? The shadow Treasurer has told us that he prefers the old indirect tax mix. He wants a roll-back to higher fuel excise, presumably to pay for the big promises that are emerging elsewhere. So the question might be asked: in whose policy will the roll-back to fuel excise, which the shadow Treasurer says that he prefers, be revealed? Will it be in the member for Batman's or the member for Hotham's? We await the answer with very great interest.  We have noticed that there has not been any mention of roll-back for a while. But we have found that the Leader of the Opposition, in commenting on the No GST Party, claimed:The only party with an honourable record on the goods and services tax was the ALP.But it gets more interesting. He also said:We're the ones who stood against it at the last election.But they are in favour of it now. He continued:We're the ones who will have - and this is the interesting bit - the practical measures to fix it up and make it fairer and simpler.It is not called roll-back anymore. They do not want to mention the `R' word anymore - like rural, remote and regional - but here it is again: they are going to adopt `practical measures to fix it up and make it fairer and simpler.' Well, rural and regional Australia would like to know what the roll-back really is, where it is going to be, who is going to pay and who is going to lose. There were a whole range of measures. We introduced the Natural Heritage Trust. Who opposed us? We introduced Work for the Dole, which is very highly regarded in rural and regional Australia. Until it became popular, who opposed us? Of course, the Labor Party leave it to the union movement now because they know that Work for the Dole is very popular, including amongst those who have been on the scheme. We introduced Networking the Nation. Who opposed it? At the moment the only evidence we have that we can be sure of in relation to the Labor Party's rural policy is that their central objective is to make it too expensive for anyone to live out there. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is about time that we saw those policies. You are running around saying that you are ready for an election any time. On that basis, you owe it to the country to reveal those policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I know her commitment to making sure that Australia gets the maximum benefits in terms of new enterprises and new jobs out of research and development. Since coming to office the government has consistently promoted innovation and knowledge. Shortly after coming to office the Prime Minister's science council became the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council. The government has recently received a report from the innovation summit, presenting the government with a range of policy options to further promote innovation in research and development. The government has established a ministerial council on biotechnology. The government is determined that we gain for Australians, in terms of new jobs and new enterprises, the maximum benefits from the technological revolutions which are now taking place in information technology and biotechnology. The opposition has, however, recently appointed a new shadow minister in this area, who has presented views to this House already which show that the opposition is not nearly as committed as the government to getting the benefits of employment from these technological revolutions. In fact, the shadow minister claimed in the House yesterday that expenditure on research and experimental development by Australian universities had suffered its greatest ever decline. This was exactly contrary to the truth. I have to say that we know that the shadow minister has never let facts get in the way of a good story, but the facts are that expenditure on research and experimental development by Australian universities increased by some 13 per cent between 1996 and 1998, that is, from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. The opposition has, one must say, a much larger problem, however, because the shadow minister has actually been going around campaigning against innovation based on biotechnology. She has been conducting a continuing campaign against biotechnology companies, saying that they are motivated by profit rather than need. Of course, that is something she does not like, because she really does not like the profit motive. This will be deeply discouraging to those in Australian industry who want to see Australia take advantage of these new technological revolutions. The problem again is that the shadow minister has a record in this area. When she was Premier of Western Australia, Peter Ellery, the Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Mines and Industry, said:We have said often enough that we believe that the Lawrence government does not have the management ability or the understanding of the mining industry which is necessary for it to effectively run this state's biggest industry.In other words, there is a record that this shadow minister really does not understand the needs of industry and industry development, and yet she is the shadow minister for industry and innovation. Terry O'Brien, the spokesman for the forest industries, said at the time:Labor lacks guts. It will not provide security for investment or the right climate for investment, which means jobs in the south-west.In relation to small business - which will be absolutely crucial in making sure that Australia takes advantage of these advances in knowledge and technology - Philip A. Church, the Executive Director of the Western Australian Small Business and Enterprise Association, said in 1993 about the management of the shadow minister when she was Premier: For 10 years the management has not been there. The real understanding of small business problems has not been there.So we have on the Labor side, contrary to the government, a shadow minister who is actually campaigning against innovation, campaigning against industry and whose record shows that she has absolutely no understanding of small business and what it takes to motivate small business. The Labor Party have no credibility in this area. If the Leader of the Opposition had had the strength to stand up to the factions, she would not now be the shadow minister and the Labor Party might have had a better chance of establishing some credibility in this area.</DOC>

 - I have been quite open in saying that I became aware of this matter at about midday on the day of that tragic accident. Can I repeat for the member opposite who, as I say, is very short on any quality policy input or debate -  - The interjector was once the Minister for Transport. Does he claim that he was a technical expert? The fact of the matter is that the technical experts on these sorts of issues are in constant and ongoing dialogue. It is appropriate that they resolve these matters. I have taken the necessary measures to ensure -   - I simply conclude by saying that this is appropriately a matter for aviation technical expertise. I have asked CASA and the bureau to accelerate their processes and to revisit the matter as a matter of urgency. That is the appropriate course of action for me, as minister, to take. The shadow minister seeks only to pursue some obscure and opportunistic political point.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. The policies of the Howard government are leading to a strong increase in skills available to the Australian work force. The ABS data for September last year show that 55 per cent of Australia's 15- to 24-year-old population were participating in education, up from 49 per cent in 1994. The Leader of the Opposition may be interested in this evidence of the increasing level of skills in the Australian work force. The biggest increases in skilling were at the tertiary level. The number of full-time tertiary students has grown by 24 per cent since 1994. So we are seeing the policies of this government working to produce the skills that Australian industry needs to become competitive. The number of new apprentices has almost doubled since the Howard government came to office, with over a quarter of a million apprentices now in training. Despite this enormous growth, there do remain some pockets in some industries which are finding it difficult to access the skilled labour that they need. In many cases, this situation has been produced by the rapid growth in the Australian economy that is taking place as a result of the highly successful economic policies of this government. The government has been working with three industries requiring urgent attention: the engineering, electro-technological and automotive industries. Each of these industries, I am pleased to say, now has an industry skills action plan. These action plans include strategies like improving the image of these industries with students, parents and teachers and helping employers take advantage of the new flexibilities under the new apprenticeship system. The government has put in place an enterprise friendly training system. This has been welcomed greatly by industry because we have taken the training system out of the control of the trade union movement, where the Labor Party firmly placed it. There are alternative suggestions on the record now from the Leader of the Opposition and in the platform of the Labor Party. These alternatives are a return to centralised labour market planning and a return to union control over the training system. They will lead to a decline in the number of apprenticeship opportunities in Australia. They will perpetuate the skills shortages that existed right through the period of the previous Labor government. The Leader of the Opposition, once again, clearly does not understand and will not get the advice to implement the policies to have industry undertake the training it needs to give it the skills that will make it competitive. The Howard government listens to business. It listens to small business. It has implemented a tax reform system which has been highly successful. It has reformed the training system to meet business needs. That is a dramatic contrast with anything the Labor Party has on the record at present.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is no - absolutely, emphatically no, it is not true. No-one in the wool industry is making that claim. The fact that you do reflects very poorly on you. Let me reiterate a couple of points. The board of AWRAP -  - Would the member for Corio like the answer or not? The board of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation wrote to me in my then capacity around midnight in 1997 as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy seeking my approval to take over the assets and liabilities of the International Wool Secretariat. My approval for that proposal recognised that the memorandum and articles of association of what was known as Newco, which was a subsidiary of AWRAP, included provisions for AWRAP to acquire the South African shares in the event that the South Africans required it to do so. It is this very process that AWRAP and the South Africans are now engaged in negotiations to settle. I renew my advice, given twice to the member opposite earlier this week, that he ought to tread very carefully on this matter lest he prejudice the interests of Australian wool growers.  - As the minister assures me, he has. I would suggest to the honourable member that his blatant politicking on this issue, with cavalier disregard for the interests of the people he purports to speak for, might very well be -  - What about the wool growers? That is the point. - That is the point. You are out there speculating -  - I did not sign up. I have just emphatically said I did not sign a contract, which is what you asked me the other day. I signed no such thing. You make a false allegation and you do it in a way that prejudices the interests of the Australian wool growers. The member opposite has been offered a briefing, as I understand it. I have no doubt that the minister for agriculture would be more than happy to give him a briefing so that he understands this issue. I see him nodding. I am delighted that he now appears willing to take up this offer, because it is a sensitive matter.  - It seems to me that you had better go and get another briefing, because the wool industry of Australia will not thank you for misrepresenting what happened and for encouraging false - and, if I may say so, ludicrous - speculation about the value of those shares. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. This is an important issue. It is one which the government has now been addressing for some time. We put out a discussion paper on changes that could be made to the operation of and the rules which affect registered organisations. `Registered organisations' includes both unions and employer organisations. The government's view, based on recent experience and the advice that we have had from interested parties, including the accounting professions, is that further reform or significant reform in this area is desirable. The government has also released an exposure bill which we would hope to be able to introduce into the parliament.In some quarters, within some registered organisations, there has been a culture which does not reflect mainstream community views. The concern that I have is based on the rights of members within registered organisations to genuinely have a say on the way in which their organisations are run. I also share the concerns of the member for Fremantle, who made the point recently that unions have a disproportionate influence on the Labor Party. That is a serious matter. As she said only a couple of weeks ago, there have been almost daily revelations within the Labor Party of all sorts of electoral rorts of one sort or another. Of course, the control that the factions have over the Labor Party has been in evidence this week. Obviously it is not in the best interests of workers that the factions should have the control that they do. My authority for that proposition is none other than the member for Fremantle.The issue of the way in which ballots are conducted and the like is a cultural thing which goes right across both sides of the labour movement - both the industrial and the political wings. The member for Lilley would know a lot about the rorts in Queensland. We have had three people, I think, who have been convicted of criminal offences in Queensland within the Labor Party and now we find that a reference of some of these issues to a parliamentary committee has been described by the Leader of the Opposition as a stunt. What an interesting contrast that makes with the Premier of Queensland, who said:If any members of my party are found to have transgressed, they will face the full consequences of the law.He also added:Should there be serious allegations of unlawful behaviour or official misconduct by anyone in parliament these people will stand aside until the matter is resolved. - He's too weak to even match a standard set by Peter Beattie. - I am sure the irony will not be lost on members of the House that the person who raised the point of order is a former trade union official in Queensland. The front bench of the Labor Party is literally stacked with these people. These are the people who are the product of the very factional deals which need to be exposed by a transparent system in the trade union movement. When these matters come on, you can be sure that the unions, through the puppets that they have sitting here, will oppose these very reforms. It was said by a person from Queensland recently that it was known about, understood and encouraged within some factions of the Labor Party at the highest level. Who was that? It was Karen Ehrmann. I conclude: if it is good enough for Peter Beattie to set a standard, why isn't it good enough for the Leader of the Opposition, just for once, to stand up to what is clearly criminal behaviour in Queensland and make it clear that he will have no truck with such behaviour? </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can indicate that the government acknowledges the Auditor-General's report in respect of the initial contracts on information technology outsourcing. There has been a rigorous analysis of the process to date. I can indicate quite clearly that rigorous audit has demonstrated that the program is fundamentally sound, that it has been conducted to the highest standards of probity and integrity and that the government is satisfied that the IT initiative's stated objectives are being achieved. I inform the House that those stated objectives are, firstly, to provide savings to the Australian taxpayers in the hundreds of millions of dollars. To date - the program is about 40 per cent along the road - those savings are around $365 million. Another stated objective is to allow Commonwealth agencies to take a strategic approach to the provision of information technology and to ensure that all those arrangements represent value for money for taxpayers. That objective is being met. Another stated objective is that there should be benefits that will flow to Australian small and medium enterprises and the Australian IT&amp;T industry. I can indicate that to date there is some $90 million worth of new strategic investment. There has been some $900 million worth of products and services sourced in Australia. There are around $290 million in new exports and import replacement activities. There is around $400 million worth of work for Australian SMEs and there has been the creation of some 400 jobs in regional Australia.I noted this morning that the Leader of the Opposition was out there and he started throwing the old words around with gay abandon, as is quite frequent at his early morning doorstops. He spoke about `grand incompetence'. Well, I would like to think that I can get the tag of `grand incompetence' when compared to some of the things that the finance minister in the former Labor government did. I wonder what that might be described as? We talk about $365 million worth of savings for the Australian taxpayers and the former finance minister uses those words. This is the man who, only six weeks before the 1996 election, was asked, `Have you got any plans to increase taxes?' His answer was, `Why would we? We're operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses for the future.' Well, we soon found out what he understood `surpluses' to mean - $10.3 billion of deficit was what surpluses meant to the Leader of the Opposition, the former finance minister. If we have a look at the Collins class submarine, $5.1 million was spent and still the meter is ticking over. If $365 million worth of savings in IT outsourcing to date is described as grand incompetence, all I can say is that the fiscal management of the former finance minister can only be described as grand larceny.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I acknowledge the very great commitment he has to public education and to building up public education in his area. Despite the fact that the states have prime responsibility for running government schools, some states are simply not living up to their responsibilities. In particular, they are not funding adequately the capital of their public school systems. I have informed the House in the past how the Howard government is pouring money into public education and, indeed, doing so at a far greater rate than any of the state governments. I remind the House that in the last budget the Commonwealth increased funding for government schools in New South Wales by 4.4 per cent compared to a miserly 1.9 per cent increase from the Carr government itself. But when you start to look at the capital account, you come to realise just how serious is the run-down occurring in New South Wales public education as a result of the failures of the Carr government. The extraordinary fact is that it appears that a majority of the money spent on capital development in government schools in New South Wales is Commonwealth funding. In 1996-97, figures show that the Commonwealth provided 54 per cent of total expenditure on capital works in government schools and later figures show little change to this, perhaps with the Commonwealth commitment moving to just under half of the total. It is interesting that it is another Labor government that is also performing exceedingly badly in this area - the Tasmanian Labor government, where latest figures show an alarming deterioration in the state government commitment to the capital stock in public education in that state. In fact, Tasmania is moving rapidly toward 100 per cent reliance on Commonwealth capital funding. Compare that with the other states, where approximately 75 per cent of the investment in public schooling in all the other states comes from the state governments and from their budgets. But when you get these Labor governments in office, and given the fact that they desperately need money for all their little pet schemes, they have not got enough left to put it into public education. It is in those states that public education is being run down. When the Labor Party was in Hobart, the Leader of the Opposition had the greatest opportunity imaginable to tell his state colleagues to lift their game in relation to public education. But of course he did not do this because he has absolutely no real interest in education. We recall that when he was minister he told his biographer, `I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining. I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than' -  - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - The first point I make is that Work for the Dole is getting employment outcomes close to 30 per cent, and the comparable Working Nation program, new work opportunities, was getting employment outcomes of under 20 per cent, so Work for the Dole is getting a 50 per cent better employment outcome than comparable Working Nation programs. That is the first point I want to make. The second point I want to make is that what we are not going to do on this side of the House is make the mistake that Labor made when they were in office and that the member for Melbourne appreciates: we are not going to give people inappropriate training for training sake. We are not going to be into that. The final point I want to make is that the member for Dickson has been telling people for the last couple of months that Labor is in favour of Work for the Dole. She keeps saying that Labor is in favour of Work for the Dole. If she is in favour of Work for the Dole, if Labor is in favour of Work for the Dole, prove it by saying something good about this great program.</DOC>

 - My particular thanks to the member for Mallee for a very important question. It draws attention to two significant documents that were released this week by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to address catchment management and salinity issues in the Murray-Darling Basin. Salinity, of course, has the potential to be a real cancer that can eat away at our landscapes, at our land productivity and at our environment. It destroys productive land and certainly threatens water quality and urban infrastructure. It is an important national priority that we address this issue, and particularly in the highly productive Murray-Darling Basin area. The two documents that were released this week are draft strategies to endeavour to address these sorts of issues. They are open for public comment at the present time. They represent a commitment to seriously address the matter with a defined plan of action to actually lower the salinity levels in this particular region. The governments involved are proposing to commit themselves to ensure that the level of salinity at the measuring point in Morgan in South Australia - an area I am sure well known to you, Mr Speaker - is at 800 parts EC for 95 per cent of the time over the 15-year period of this plan. That is a significantly challenging task. It also includes the setting of targets for each of the valleys in the Murray Darling system so that each region, each community, can be aware of their obligations to ensure that the overall health of the Murray-Darling Basin is maintained.Unfortunately, in the context of looking at the interdependence of the various communities and the various governments in the effective management of this commission, there are two state Labor governments that are not prepared to make the basic commitment that is essential in this element by securing water rights for land-holders. Unfortunately, the New South Wales and Queensland governments have been unwilling to make this key commitment to ensure that their regional communities can participate in the growth and progress in the Murray-Darling Basin to attract new industries and to develop and create new jobs. Some of the capacity to be innovative and to develop new industries in the Murray-Darling Basin is particularly evident in the electorate of the member for Mallee. The Sunraysia area has been especially innovative in developing new irrigation techniques and in developing new agricultural processes. I note that the opposition have just appointed a new minister for innovation, but she has indicated that she is not interested in innovation in agriculture. She has discounted its value. I think that is very disappointing. There are some great success stories in agriculture, many of them in the electorate of the member for Mallee. These new strategies will provide an opportunity to spread those benefits throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system to maintain the health of the water and the environment in the region and to maintain productive agriculture for future generations. This is a vital issue for all Australians, and I am appalled that opposition members show so little concern for this vital part of Australia. This government will work with the communities to develop sustainable management practices in the Murray-Darling Basin area. </DOC>

 - In relation to the savings bonus for veterans, my understanding from my department is that 95 per cent of veterans have been eligible and have received a savings bonus. In fact, 50 per cent of them have received the maximum bonus and the average bonus that has been received by 95 per cent of veterans is something like $750. The comments I am getting back from the veteran community is that they are very grateful for this bonus. They are also very grateful for the fact that every veteran entitlement was increased by four per cent across the board - not just a service pension or a TPI pension but all pensions across the board - and it has been well received by our veteran community. They are very grateful for the fact that this government cares for our veterans.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to say that this government since coming to office has put in place a whole system of reforms, the most important of which is a system of accreditation and establishing standards which have never existed before for residential aged care facilities to meet. We have required that every facility be accredited by 1 January 2001, otherwise they will lose Commonwealth funding. We have a system of contingency planning in place to ensure continuity of care for those residents where the residential aged care facility may not meet accreditation. To enable this to take place, we have increased funding by $1.4 billion since coming to office to enable those new standards to go into place. We have increased the number of community aged care places from 4,000 when we came to office to 24,000 now, for the simple reason that we know people want to stay at home for as long as they possibly can. We have increased home and community care funding. This year it is $565 million, an increase of $7.6 million over last year. We have increased the number of places that have been made available because the Auditor-General found when we came to office that the Labor Party had left us 10,000 places short. In this year's round of over 14,000 and last year's round, we are putting into place more than 22,000 new places, which in fact will make up for that deficit and provide for growth and dependency. We have put in place policies to provide for respite, because we know that many people staying at home have carers who need support, and we have put in place a much increased program for that. We have increased the funding for people who suffer from dementia and need residential aged care by a total of 92 per cent since we came into office. These policies are strong and delivering better care in both residential care and the ability to have care at home than has ever been in place before.  I did look to see alternative policies that might be available. In this regard I looked at a debate in the Senate that took place the day before yesterday when Senator Evans, the opposition spokesman, said: The Labor Party support accreditation and support having high standards ... This is the same Senator Evans, I might add, who was so concerned about the policy for care for older Australians that he did not even turn up to address their convention on this issue. They had to have a contribution from the dimmer of the Glimmers, who had to pinch-hit for him. He came up to the podium huffing and puffing in being called in at the last minute. Nevertheless, when I did go to their web site to find the document called ALP Platform 2000: Security and Opportunity for Older Australians, I found that they say that they support accreditation, that they recognise that older Australians prefer to stay in their own homes -  - and they have policies to support carers of people who stay home to look after those in need of care. I then went to look at an interview the same Senator Evans gave on ABC radio yesterday. I think it is very important to notice this. Senator Evans, the shadow minister, said: It's a good thing that we are getting higher standards. That's got bipartisan support. He said:It's a good thing we are trying to drive poor providers out who aren't prepared to meet the new standards. Then he said:The Opposition's more than willing to help make sure that any transition brought about by the accreditation deadline is managed properly without fear and gives certainty to families and to residents. - And I would very simply say to the Leader of the Opposition, who thinks that care for older Australians is a matter of great mirth, that the bipartisan support you have stated you will give is one that we look forward to, to ensure that you do not fearmonger in the area of aged care.</DOC>

 - The one thing the coalition government has done is that we have compensated older Australians for any reduction in purchasing power -  -  - which you never did. The Australian Labor Party never did so in 1993, when it jacked up wholesale sales taxes unrelentingly. As the previous minister said, for the aged savings bonus, over 1.45 million Australians have received a bonus. Seventy per cent of those have received a bonus of over $500 and 55 per cent an age savings bonus of over $1,000. Likewise with the supplementary self-funded retirees bonus, they have an option and most of them will be claiming it at the end when they put in their financial assessments. - Now, to answer the question from the member for Lilley, if he would like to sit down.  - Absolutely, Mr Speaker. - I know the member for Lilley has probably got some other things on his conscience this week, but I would not want to mention that of course. - Regarding the savings bonuses, if they feel as though their assessments are incorrect, they can go to Centrelink. - Regarding the supplementary bonus, they have the option of using either financial year, whichever is the better, to put in for the supplementary bonus. - Regarding the forms, they are available from the Australian Taxation Office, and I am responsible for Centrelink.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - The Olympics, the world's greatest sporting event, begin in Sydney next Friday. - I will begin again, Mr Speaker. The Olympics, the world's greatest sporting event, commence in Sydney next Friday. They will be followed by the Paralympics, which begin on 18 October. It is of course a great honour for Australia to be hosting both the Olympics and the Paralympics. The federal government has provided significant support for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. In fact, since the time of the games bid, the Commonwealth has provided around $450 million to help stage the Olympic and Paralympic Games. We have also absorbed considerable additional costs relating to the work of the Australian Defence Force during the games, and costs relating to games security and our Tough on Drugs policy.The government has provided funding to help our athletes ensure that they are prepared as well as possible, including $145 million in direct assistance to athletes competing in Olympic sports - funding over and above ongoing normal funding for sport. We will have this year our biggest ever Olympic team - more than 620 athletes will be representing us at the games. Well over 10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries will be competing, and they have been arriving in increasing numbers in recent weeks. The international athletes will be accompanied by an additional 100,000 estimated visitors to Australia for the Olympic Games. The event provides a great opportunity to promote our country and to generate investment and jobs, particularly in tourism. The eyes of the world will literally be on Australia, with the television broadcast having an estimated worldwide audience of no less than 3.7 billion people. The Australian community has demonstrated its support for the Olympics and, in particular, for our athletes in getting behind the Olympic torch as it is carried across Australia. Truly, sport and the Olympics bring the community together. Mr Speaker, I hope you will allow me to make one or two final remarks that are not strictly relevant to the question. I am sure that all honourable members will join me in wishing Australia's Olympic team well.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - I have no doubt that all would want to acknowledge and commend the unbelievably dedicated and continual hard work that the Minister for Sport and Tourism has put into the event. I know too that all of us would want to do what is only reasonable at this time, and that is to acknowledge the roles of two members of this place in their previous roles in the New South Wales parliament: the former Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. John Fahey, and a senior member in the former government, the member for Cook, Bruce Baird. Both played instrumental roles in bringing Australians this great privilege - take a bow! - of hosting the Olympic Games.Finally, I know that we will all be watching the medal count, but I do want to say this: we must remember that it is an honour and a privilege just to participate in the Olympics. The men and women that we are sending to the games will remember the next few weeks for the rest of their lives. They will be forever honoured by the title of Olympian. I know that all members in this place join me in expressing the hope that all Australians truly enjoy the games. On that bipartisan note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - That was an entirely predictable and completely opportunistic question. It also entirely distorts both what I have said and what the government has done. What I have pointed out and what is unarguably the case is that the principal driver of high petrol prices is the world price of crude oil, and none other than the Victorian Labor Premier acknowledged that on Melbourne radio as recently as this morning when he said, `The price of oil around the world has gone to over $US30 a barrel and there's really nothing much Australia can do about that.' Of course it would be possible for the government to embrace a discretionary reduction in the level of fuel excise. To make any sizeable impact on the price of petrol I imagine the average Australian consumer would want to see the price come down by at least 5c a litre. That would cost $1.7 billion a year. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has committed the opposition party to a freezing of future indexation increases. - Oh, that is not right? Oh, that is not true. Well, I will be very pleased to hear from the Leader of the Opposition. So you are saying that that is not true.  -  So, in other words, you do not have an alternative policy. - I will be very interested to hear what the alternative policy of the Australian Labor Party is. The reality is that the world price of oil has trebled over the last 18 months and, as a result, the price of petrol in Australia has risen. That is not the result of the GST; it is the result of a rise in the world price of oil. If you go around the world, you will find the prices paid for petrol in other parts of the world are also high. For example, in the United Kingdom, which is often a role model for the present Labor opposition, because it is led by the soul mate of the Leader of the Opposition, the price of petrol is approximating $2.30 a litre. The taxation take in the United Kingdom approximates 75 per cent of the price of a litre of petrol at the bowser. I want to make it clear to the consumers of Australia that we understand their unhappiness at the high price of petrol. To reduce the price of petrol by a discretionary cut in excise to have any impact at all would take about $1.5 billion to $2 billion out of the budget deficit. In the present climate of international levels of interest rates and our concern about domestic interest rates, we see no merit at all in running the budget surplus down by the order of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. It is incumbent on both sides of politics in Australia, if they argue for measures which are going to involve a cost to the budget, to detail the cost of those measures and to justify a running down of the surplus in current circumstances. There has been an improved budget outcome in relation to the just completed financial year, but it is altogether too early to responsibly make judgments about what the budget outcome will be this year. It is the height of economic irresponsibility to make judgments on the basis of only three months of a 12-month financial year period yet commit yourself to additional expenditure or to forgone revenue that covers not only the whole of the financial year but years into the future. It is easy to embrace opportunistic calls for reductions in the budget surplus and reductions in budget revenue. In the long run, the best thing that the government can do for the people of Australia is to continue to manage the Australian economy with care, skill and the accomplishment and levels of success that have been apparent over the last 4½ years. It remains a source of very great pride to this government, to me as Prime Minister and to the Treasurer that over the last 4½ years we have reduced the government debt to GDP ratio of this country to probably the lowest level of any industrialised country in the world. In other words, we have used any windfall that may have come in in the last financial year to reduce the debt that you ran up when you were in government. Indeed, if you had not left us with $96 billion of debt, we may have been able to do a lot more with the revenue that we now have. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question and acknowledge the great contribution that he makes to this House. I indicate in answer to his question that the final budget outcome for 1999-2000 was released -  - by the finance minister and me on Friday. It showed that, depending on whether you take the cash measure or the fiscal measure, the budget outcome for 1999-2000 was a surplus of around $13 billion. It was the largest budget surplus in dollar terms recorded in Australia and, as a proportion of GDP, the largest surplus since 1971 and 1972. As the Prime Minister said, by putting the budget into surplus, this government has now been able to repay $43 billion of the $80 billion of Labor debt that was run up in five years.  - $80 billion was run up in five years to a cumulative total of $96 billion. If I can explain it to the member for Hotham, before the last five budgets of the Labor Party the net Commonwealth debt stood at $16 billion and in five budgets they took it from $16 billion to $96 billion, with all-time records produced by the then minister for finance, the now Leader of the Opposition. The good news is that no longer do we run up Commonwealth debt and, of that $80 billion run up in Labor's last five budgets, the coalition has now managed to pay back $43 billion. We are now halfway to undoing the damage of Labor in those last five years of government, and that is a great achievement.When this government came to office, we spent the same amount on servicing Labor debt as we spent on schools and education and hospitals. Now the amount that we spend on schools and hospitals is double the amount we spend on servicing Labor's debt, and that is an investment in the future now that we have broken the back of the wanton profligacy of the Labor Party. The second thing that putting the budget back into surplus by $13 billion as at 30 June 2000 enabled this government to do was to introduce on 1 July this year the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. That was the dividend of putting the budget back into surplus, and we have been able to pass on a $12 billion income tax cut as a consequence. Good economic management consisted of putting the budget into surplus; Labor fought us all the way. Good economic management consisted of paying back Labor's debt; Labor fought us all the way. Good economic management consisted of increasing spending on health and education when we cut the interest bill of Labor; Labor fought us all the way. Good economic management consisted of introducing from 1 July this year the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. Many people ask, `If the budget was in surplus at 30 June by $13 billion, shouldn't taxes be cut?' The answer is: they have been; they were cut. They were cut on 1 July - the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. They were cut in relation to diesel for truck drivers. They will be cut further in relation to financial institutions duty, bank accounts debit tax and stamp duties on shares. These are some of the benefits of good economic management. The good thing was that, notwithstanding their attempts to frustrate it, the Labor Party failed. The coalition were able to deliver good economic management.</DOC>

 - As I have observed many times in this House, the member for Hotham began by making a false statement in his question, on the old ACTU principle that, if you repeat the falsehood enough times, somebody will start to believe it. The second point I would like to make is the following: I welcome the Labor Party's interest in the indexation of excise on fuel because, after all, it was the Labor Party that introduced it in 1983. - That is right - you are going to roll back the GST. I had forgotten that. - He did not introduce the GST; he is going to roll it back - a word which has not passed the Leader of the Opposition's lips since 21 July. We all wait for roll-back. When the Labor Party introduced the indexation of fuel - a policy which it steadfastly maintained from 1983 until it was voted out of office in 1996 - the petrol excise was 6.155c a litre. When it left office in 1996, the petrol excise was 34c a litre; that is, it rose from 6c a litre to 34c a litre. After absorbing the 8c a litre state excise, which the Commonwealth has absorbed because of the High Court case Haha and Lim, the excise is now at 38c a litre. So talk about the world experts on indexing petrol excise - it is the Australian Labor Party.I am then asked: what are you going to do for farmers? Let me make this point in relation to farmers: farmers who use diesel off-road in their tractors or harvesters do not pay excise on their diesel. You cannot cut it any further, because farmers do not pay excise on their diesel. Whenever they are off-road in relation to their tractors or their farm machinery, there is no excise. On their diesel, there is a full diesel fuel rebate. The next question we are asked is: what would you do in relation to transport? In relation to transport - that is, vehicles outside metropolitan areas or over 20 tonnes - the excise on diesel today is 24c less than it was on 30 June; that is, we cut the tax on diesel for transport by 24c a litre on 1 July. We were opposed in doing that by the Australian Labor Party. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, today farmers would be paying 24c a litre more tax on their diesel.There were some recent blockades in both Melbourne and Queensland by truck drivers. The press consistently reported that they were over petrol. Major tankers use diesel. The tax on diesel for heavy transport and transport outside capital cities was reduced on 1 July by 24c a litre. Some elements of the press tried to run this together as if this were like the European blockade. Can I observe that there had been no cut in excise in Europe. If the European drivers had been given a cut of 24c a litre, as applied in this country from 1 July, I am sure that they would not have been engaging in what they were. They were looking for the kind of treatment that Australian truck drivers got.  - The member for Hotham, the old ACTU president, interjects. His policy was nothing; no cut. - No GST, he says. A truck driver gets a full input tax credit for all of his GST and got a 24c a litre cut in his tax from 1 July. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, today farmers would be paying 24c a litre extra tax on all of their transport. Let us go through our policy. The policy is a full rebate for all diesel off-farm, a cut in tax of 24c a litre in relation to their transport, and where they use petrol in their business an input tax credit one-eleventh less. You put that together with the income tax cuts, the cuts in capital gains tax and the cuts in company tax, and you have a government which has delivered on tax. The one thing that you can say to the truck drivers of Australia is this: aren't they lucky the old ACTU president did not have his way because, whatever the price of diesel is today, truck drivers would be paying an extra 24c a litre if the Australian Labor Party were in office?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of a number of comments over recent days, particularly one article in the Sydney Morning Herald by the member for Jagajaga which, I have to say, is wrong in quite a number of areas. As we know, the honourable member never lets the facts get in the way of a good story. I do not intend to weary the House with a detailed response to this - it would take too long - but there are two things that have happened in the last few weeks since the House sat that I think it is worth informing the House of.The first is that the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to proceed with individual criminal prosecutions against radiologists. I am advised that the Director of Public Prosecutions made his decision primarily on the basis of advice that cases could not prove criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt as required by the standards of criminal law. This is in spite of the fact that there was evidence that some of the contracts sent to the Health Insurance Commission bore a date earlier than the date that the signatures were attached to those documents.The second thing that has happened in recent weeks is that the government has finalised its position on Professor Blandford's report on the way ahead on this technology. Professor Blandford is from Flinders University. He has done a thorough and exemplary job on this technology and he has made 10 recommendations to the government. The government intends to accept them all. Seven of the recommendations can be implemented straightaway. Three of them we are putting back to him for some further detailed work. Two of the recommendations include the setting up of an independent committee to look at the way we expand this technology, particularly on the basis of new scientific evidence coming to us and new clinical evidence as to the way this technology works. We think this is good and we are happy to take it.Professor Blandford says there are some areas that are seriously undersupplied with MRI. He notes south-west Western Australia, rural Queensland, rural New South Wales and outer metropolitan New South Wales. So the government is prepared to fund up to another seven machines, particularly in those areas that he identifies. When we look at where we were four years ago with this technology that is used particularly for brain and spinal cord disease, we find that people had to pay $600 to $800 for a scan. Today they pay between nothing and $50. Four years ago people had to wait four months for a scan. Today they wait one to two weeks. Four years ago we had 18 machines available to the public in Australia. Today we have 66. We intend to expand this technology to rural Australia. Rural Australia should have the right to expect similar standards. Professor Blandford gives us the way ahead. </DOC>

 - I do remember visiting Hamilton and I remember saying a number of things to the people of Hamilton, including how well represented they are in the parliament by the member for Wannon. I remember that very vividly. As always when you are asked questions like this, if you are prudent, you check the exact transcript because occasionally they leave a word or a comma out, don't they? Occasionally they misrepresent what you said. I would have said that there were a lot of benefits for country people. There have been, and there remain, immense benefits. I am surprised, after what the Treasurer said, that any Labor Party frontbencher would have the gall to ask a question about cheaper fuel. You lot wanted to make it 24c a litre dearer. - The reality is that the increase in the price of fuel around Australia, and indeed around the world, over recent months has been caused by a sharp increase in the world price of crude oil. The other reality is that, if the Labor Party had had its way, every farmer in Australia and every truck driver would have been paying more for their fuel than they are now paying. The real comparison is between a group of men and women on this side of the parliament who voted in favour of a 24c a litre reduction in diesel and those on the other side who opposed it. - I would further reinforce the point that I have made and that the Treasurer has made by referring the member for Corio, and others opposite who are interested, to the Shell web site, for example, which shows that the refinery price of petrol has risen by 5.4c a litre between 30 June and 2 October. That data also shows that the average retail price over the same period has increased by 5.6c a litre. For anybody to argue, in the face of that, that the driver of petrol price increases over the past few months has been other than the increase in the world price of crude oil is to defy reason and to defy logic.The reality, if anybody cares to check, is that in the days immediately after the GST was introduced - and that would be the crucial date in deciding whether the GST had produced an increase in the price of petrol - the price of petrol either remained the same or, in many parts of Australia, actually fell. It was only later on, when increases in the world price of crude oil were resumed, that the price at the bowser began to rise. Those opposite who voted to inflict a 24c a litre higher price of diesel on the users of it around Australia have no credibility in arguing for changes in government policy. We regret - and we are doing what we can internationally, as are other countries - the increases that have occurred in the world price of crude oil. But we have opportunistic, hypocritical questions and attacks from those who sit opposite, those who introduced petrol excise, those who presided in their 13 years of government. I had some interesting material taken out on the cost of a tank of petrol as a proportion of weekly wages over the last 30 years. It produces some very interesting analysis. It shows that under the coalition the average cost of filling a tank with petrol as a proportion of weekly wages has been about 3.8 per cent. It also shows that under 13 years of Labor the average was 4.5 per cent. Indeed, that 3.8 per cent not only would probably be higher but certainly would get higher in the future if the Labor Party's attitude towards excise on diesel had prevailed. They voted for a higher excise on diesel. They prevailed over a regime which produced, on average, a higher cost to the motorist over the period that they were in government.We have kept our commitments in relation to the GST and the price of petrol. The reason why the price of petrol is painfully high throughout Australia is that the OPEC countries have pushed up the world price. The solution lies in a change at that level. It does not lie in the opportunistic sallies of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and I know of her strong support for school funding reform. It is indeed, as she says, going to expand opportunities for choice for low income families in her electorate. The government's funding reforms for non-government schools replaced Labor's discredited funding system, the ERI system, with fairer, more equitable and transparent funding. Information released to schools last week exposes just how false were the claims by Labor, and the member for Dobell in particular, in this House on 30 August that the government was interested only in giving increased funding to the wealthier schools. The member for Dobell should apologise to the House, because the accurate information is now on the public record. What this shows is that schools serving less well-off communities will receive increased funding -  - of up to 70 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school or $5,721 per secondary student by the year 2004. - That is still less than is given to a government school student but a very significant increase in funding for low income parents. By contrast, those schools serving the world's most well-to-do communities funded by the government's new funding system receive only 13.7 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school or $1,120 per student in 2004. Labor claimed that the 62 elite schools -   - would receive an average of $800,000 per school.  - Labor was wrong. What are the facts? The facts are now on the record and they show that the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities in Australia will receive an average increase -   - The facts show that the schools serving the 67 wealthiest communities in Australia will receive an increase of $184,791 per school in 2004, less than a quarter of the amount claimed by the member for Dobell. That just shows how far Labor will go to stir up misunderstanding and division in the community. The government have put forward reforms which have strong community support. I draw the House's attention to the results of a recent Saulwick survey which showed that more than two-thirds of voters support the principle of government assistance to non-government schools and that a very clear majority of these voters support that assistance being based on the needs of parents. The Labor Party now finds itself in a completely untenable position, because it opposes our policy but it does not have a policy of its own, and non-government schools are entitled -   - The Leader of the Opposition says, `It's rubbish; they do have a policy.' - Non-government schools are very keen to know what the Labor Party's policy is. Does it intend to return to the ERI funding system? Does it intend to reduce the grants that schools will receive under our funding system? Do you intend to revive the new schools policy? The fact is that no-one knows. - He wants to get rid of the opportunity for low income families to choose the school which suits them. The member for Bendigo should stand up and refute the comments of the member for Dobell. He should stand up for increased funding for Central Goldfields Christian College. The member for Werriwa should stand up for increased funding for the Macquarie Fields Seventh Day Adventist schools. Likewise, where are the members for Bass, for Dickson, for Kingston and for the Northern Territory in defending funding for low income families in their electorates? All the information is now available on the public record and it shows that Labor has no policy and has been trying to mislead the Australian public.</DOC>

 - The interest displayed by the member for Banks in Meals-on-Wheels is commendable and it is a great example of the Australian volunteer spirit. But the claims that underpin his question are dubious at best and deliberately mischievous at worst.  -  - They are. I hate to burst the balloon, but the reality is that this new-found liberation on the back bench does not extend to inserting in your question the causes of increases in the price of fuel. Would you like me to go through it all again? I really do not like to detain the House, Mr Speaker, but they keep asking me. Can I just quietly and patiently explain to the member for Banks that we have a system of world parity pricing in this country whereby the price of petrol is driven by the world price of crude oil. This policy was introduced in 1979 by the Fraser government. It was, I can say, wholeheartedly embraced by the Hawke government, and it was grabbed with both arms in an eager bear hug by the Treasurer in the Hawke government who subsequently became the Prime Minister. Not only did they embrace that but also they embraced a thing called the half-yearly indexation of petrol excise. - I guess you embrace something you introduce. But the Treasurer corrects me: they introduced and embraced it, and it has remained a policy. You know, Mr Speaker, and everybody in this parliament knows, and everybody in the press gallery knows - and I am certain that all of those motorist organisations that are lobbying at the present time also know - that if the world price of crude oil had stabilised at or about 1 July or, indeed, had gone down we would not be having any debate about the price of petrol.The reality behind what has driven the price of petrol up, what has made it a difficult issue - and I acknowledge that it is causing concern in the Australian community and it is a matter that has been raised with me by people in many walks of life, including over the past few weeks - the truth as distinct from fable and opportunism, is that you really have two alternatives: either you see a reduction in the world price of oil or you embrace a discretionary reduction in the level of excise. If you embrace a discretionary reduction in the level of excise, that will run the budget surplus down. - I do not believe it is economically responsible to run the budget surplus down at the present time. And it is too early -  - It is far too early to make final judgments -  - about what the budget outcomes of the current financial year are going to be. I have no clear view of what the budget outcome for this year is going to be, over and above what was announced by the Treasurer in May of this year. Those who run around saying that you should embrace a discretionary reduction are arguing, on all the information available to the government at the present time, for a lower budget surplus than we now have. That would not be good for interest rates, it would not be good for world perceptions of the exchange rate, it would not be good economic management; and that is why the government is not willing to embrace that policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question, and I note that unemployment in his region has fallen from 9.5 per cent in March 1996 to just 5.5 per cent now, thanks to the splendid policies of the Howard government. I am aware of recent comments by the member for Fremantle reported in the West Australian newspaper claiming that southern Perth was being deliberately starved of employment services. I note that unemployment in the statistical region covering southern Perth is 7.6 per cent. It is far too high of course, but it is much less than 14.3 per cent, which was the peak hit in December 1992, when none other than the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training and when the member for Fremantle herself was Premier of Western Australia. When it comes to the subject of unemployment, members opposite have absolutely no sense of shame. The member for Fremantle has made the very serious claim that this government is guilty of `explicit discrimination' against people in southern Perth. Let me point out that, when Labor was in government, there were just 14 CES offices in metropolitan Perth. Now there are nearly 70 Job Network sites in metropolitan Perth, half of those south of the Swan River. When Labor was in government, there were just two CES offices in the electorate of Fremantle. There are now 10 Job Network sites serving the people of Fremantle. Of course Australia needs a responsible opposition. Unfortunately, what it has got is an opposition that will say or do absolutely anything in its quest to score a cheap political point, and the Australian people and the people of Perth deserve much better.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should look across the Tasman, I would have thought. That would have provided a very ready answer to his comment. - You asked me a question and I answered it. Mr Speaker, they go into great hilarity. As I have said before, it is psychobabble followed by exaggerated laughter. He yells and then he goes into great laughter, as if this is some kind of joke. I know the admiration you have for Swaziland. It is the Australian Labor Party and the government of Swaziland that remain committed to wholesale sales tax. When I saw those athletes from Botswana come in - and Premier Bracks will be my witness on this because I saw him at the opening ceremony - I cheered loudly and said `a progressive force against the Australian Labor Party'. Botswana is embracing tax reform - or did I get it wrong? Maybe the Labor Party really do agree with the goods and services tax. Maybe they really do. It was 21 July that we last heard the word that begins with `r' uttered by the Leader of the Opposition - the `r' word. It is called `roll-back'. - I do want to make a couple of serious points about the state of the economy. Mr Speaker, as you know, Australia operates a flexible exchange rate - a policy which was introduced by the Labor Party in 1983 and a policy which we adopted and support. As a consequence of that, exchange rates vary according to movements in other currencies. As I have observed on a number of occasions before, what is happening in the world currency markets at the moment is principally the rise of the American dollar and the fall of the euro. The fall of the euro has been so substantial that a week ago there was a central bank intervention, which has probably never occurred before, coordinated by the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan in relation to the euro. That had the effect of stabilising the euro at that time, which stabilised world currencies - something that Australia certainly welcomed. From the government's point of view, the important thing is to keep a strong, fundamental economy. The fundamentals of the Australian economy are very sound and very strong. Since this House last met, we had the national accounts for the June 2000 quarter, which showed that the Australian economy grew above four per cent continuously for 13 quarters for the first time in Australian history. The fiscal outcome for the year just ended on 30 June 2000 was the largest in Australia's history. Inflation in Australia is historically low, notwithstanding the one-off effect of tax reform, which we expect to have flowed through in this quarter and which will be reflected when the CPI for this quarter comes out. Inflation by world standards is low.As the Prime Minister said of Australia's fiscal position, our central government debt to GDP now stands at eight per cent, compared with those of Europe and America, which are over 40 per cent. We have managed to bring that down from a peak of 20 per cent. If the Senate should pass the government's legislation, then Australia's central government debt to GDP ratio could, in the next couple of years, go to zero - that is, we could clear all Commonwealth debt. There is only one thing that stands in the way of that goal for Australia, and in the way of the wonderful opportunities that it would set up, and that is the Australian Labor Party. If the Australian Labor Party had any decent respect for Australia's economic position, it would certainly deal with that. We continue apace with our reform of the taxation system. We continue apace with our reform of the industrial relations system, which the Labor Party also opposes. People have remarked on the productivity performance of the US economy over the last three or four years. The productivity performance of Australia has outstripped that of the United States over the last three and four years; that is, our performance has become faster growing with higher productivity - in both a labour and a multifactor sense - than that of the United States. It is a credit to structural reform. It is something that should not be stopped. It is something which the government will continue to put in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and recognise the continuing interest he shows in foreign affairs issues. The Australian government is deeply concerned at the loss of at least 56 lives and the damage to mutual confidence between Israel and the Palestinians that has occurred as a result of the violent confrontations in the different parts of the West Bank, Gaza and Israel in recent days. Both the provocation which led to the disturbances and the violence that has followed have been widely and justifiably deplored. There has been a period in recent times when a final settlement to the Middle East problems has appeared to be increasingly possible and the latest events have obviously cast a shadow over Israelis and Palestinians alike.It is the government's view that it is now essential for both sides to take all measures necessary to end the current violence, both in the Palestinian areas and within Israel, and to redouble their efforts to secure a comprehensive agreement through negotiations. Despite the severe blow which recent events have represented to the peace process, the leaderships of both sides remain committed to the resolution of their dispute, and they do deserve the support of their people for their efforts to build a lasting peace and an opportunity to do so without being undermined by terror or provocation directed against the other party. I very much hope - and I know many in the international community hope - that the recent violence will be turned into a spur to encourage the revitalisation and conclusion of the peace process and not accelerate a further descent into increasing violence. In conclusion, Australian travellers are strongly advised to defer travel to those areas affected by the latest violence. </DOC>

 - If I can go to the last part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, I do not accept that proposition. I think it is a very superficial argument that says that the economic relevance of the use of technology, particularly information technology, is to be found in the investment in the manufacture of it rather than the application of it. There is nothing falser than the notion that is being fuelled by the Leader of the Opposition and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as they flail around for some kind of political argument, that despite the fact that we are right up there at the very top - second only on most measures to the United States - in the use of information technology and in the use of innovative approaches it is because we are not a manufacturer of it that you can lay all the comments and all the observations about the level of the Australian dollar at that particular door. That is a completely false argument, just as the argument that seeks to create a false divide between a so-called new economy and a so-called old economy is also a completely false argument. If Australia were lagging so badly in technology application, our productivity performance would not have outclassed that of the United States. So that explanation is not to be found in the proposition put by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is some good news in this area - or at least some hopeful news. You would think the Labor Party, finally finding a health policy after 4½ years, would decide to put it out and actually give it some publicity. We had the Labor Party on 25 September, Monday, announcing that they had done a complete backflip in relation to private health insurance. The day they chose, 10 months after the legislation came in to the parliament, was the day Cathy Freeman was running in the 400 metres final. Why might the opposition be choosing the highest news day this year to announce good news in private health insurance? There is only one reason, and that is that they are embarrassed by the comments that they are on the record as making in the last 2½ years on private health insurance. In February of this year the Leader of the Opposition described the 30 per cent rebate as a dreadful failure - `It is a complete and monumental failure' - so much so that the Labor Party has accepted it in toto, without any change whatsoever. The member for Jagajaga in 1998 in the debate in this parliament on the rebate said, `What we have got here tonight is the worst example of public policy ever seen in this parliament' - so bad the Labor Party has accepted it lock, stock and barrel.In fact, the member for Jagajaga has put out 30 press releases on this issue in the last 2½ years. I have looked to see if she put out a press release on 25 September, last Monday, to announce the backflip. It is the first time in history we have not been showered with confetti press releases by the opposition - so ashamed is she that she has been rolled on this issue. It is not only that: if you look at the Labor Party's web site, which usually has the most trivial musings of the Leader of the Opposition, there is not a word on this - no transcript, no idea that they have changed whatsoever on the issue. It was put perfectly in the Australian when they described it as:... Kim Beazley at his poll driven worst, with a proposition he does not believe in.The simple fact is the Labor Party did not invent the 30 per cent rebate, they did not want the 30 per cent rebate, they did not support the 30 per cent rebate, and they just cannot be believed on this issue.</DOC>

 - I accept the implied compliment in the question - that I am sort of a walking encyclopaedia of what everyone in the government does. I will answer for myself. It is a fair question. Then as well as answering the question I will add another little bit which is relevant to the issue raised by the member for Kingsford-Smith. I was given a general briefing about the investigation. I was not told until after the warrant had been executed that the visit had taken place. That is my position. I was not told. Can I also make the point that the decision to issue and execute the warrant was done quite independently of the government. At no stage was my permission - or to my knowledge the permission of anybody else in the government - sought for the issue or the execution of the warrant.Protestations of unprecedented outrage have emanated from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was red with rage the morning that this took place, on the basis that this has never happened before. That would be news to the member for Gippsland; it would be news to the Treasurer; it would be news to many other people. I would remind the House, as the member for Kingsford-Smith has raised this matter, that in 1993 in the course of an AFP investigation into a leak to the Age of an Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence report on allegations of organised crime in the meat industry search warrants were issued in relation to the federal member for Gippsland, Mr McGauran, and a member of his staff, Mr Peter Richards. Specifically, warrants were issued on 27 January 1993 to search Mr McGauran's private residence and his electorate office. A warrant to search Mr Richards's private residence also was issued on 27 January 1993.There is a suggestion coming from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kingsford-Smith that the action taken by the Federal Police represented some kind of unprecedented infringement of the rights of members of parliament, some never before attempted invasion of human rights by the Australian Federal Police acting under the direction of the government - the executive using the police for political purposes; that was the tenor of what the Leader of the Opposition said. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kingsford-Smith were members of the then Labor government when that warrant was issued - against not the staff member alone but the shadow minister himself. That was followed several months later by the issue of yet another warrant involving the member for Gippsland. The police were asked to conduct an investigation. At all times, as I have been advised, the appropriate separation between the actions of the Federal Police and ministers was obtained. The normal protocols regarding generalised briefing would have been observed. Permission was not sought for the issue of these warrants. The decision to issue and execute was taken by the Federal Police in the exercise of their prerogatives. The nonsense proposition coming from the member for Kingsford-Smith that this is an unprecedented action, an invasion of his rights, is an absolute distortion, a complete untruth and an attempt to mislead this parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. He was very keen to see the government take every advantage of the opportunity, while the focus of the world was on Australia during the Olympics, to showcase what we have in our country in terms of technological development, a strong economy and opportunities for investment. Very early in the piece our government took the decision that we would maximise the business opportunities arising from the Olympics in Australia in the year 2000, and we established a program called `Australia Open for Business'. Part of that program was Business Club Australia, which was situated at Darling Harbour. We had over 14,000 visitors to Business Club Australia during the Olympics attending different networking functions and functions promoting Australia as a place for investment, a place to do business and a place to establish headquarters in the region. Of course it has been an outstanding success. Australia's Olympic team did very well in terms of the medals they won; Australia has done extremely well with its stunning success in the conduct of the Olympic Games and certainly our business promotional program during the Olympics has also been a stunning success.Over the period in the lead-up to and during the Olympic Games some $400 million in investment and trade has been secured, including new investments in the telecommunications, agriculture, manufacturing and IT sectors. Through the Virtual Club members of the Business Club were able to participate and generate new export opportunities both before and during the Olympic Games, and certainly well and truly after the closing ceremony last Sunday night members of the Business Club will be communicating in the Virtual Club doing business. For members' information the world's second biggest distributor of interactive entertainment software, Info Gram Entertainment, announced at Business Club last Wednesday that it is going to establish its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Melbourne, which will create up to 160 new jobs in that facility, an initial great outcome from the government's activities promoting Australia as a safe place for investment. It is estimated that about $1 billion worth of new trade and investment will be generated through the `Australia Open for Business' initiative. Overall, as a result of the Olympic Games, it is estimated that there will be $6.5 billion worth of benefit to Australia's GDP between now and 2006.Of course it does not end there. We have had a great deal of interest shown by the next host city, Athens, in this type of activity in terms of running a business promotion initiative. Certainly we are going to capitalise on the expertise and the skills base that have been built up in Australia over the four to five years leading up to the Olympics in Sydney. Austrade will be establishing an office in Athens to maximise the Australian business opportunities in Greece over the next four years that will present themselves during that time.It goes without saying that I would like to thank all the people involved in Business Club Australia and all the people involved from the different departments who have worked tirelessly over the 16 days to ensure that we maximised the business opportunities out of the Olympics. We have done that - it has been proven and recognised by our international visitors. The investment that will flow into Australia and the trade opportunities that will be developed over coming years will go a long way towards securing new jobs and investment in Australia in the future. </DOC>

 - I have read in full the remarks that were recorded in Le Monde. I believe that the reaction to those remarks - whilst I can understand why people would react in that way - has been unfair to the minister. I will not therefore reprimand the minister. The minister is known in this parliament for his decency and compassion towards indigenous people. The minister - and I have known this minister for in excess of 30 years - has always displayed a very conscientious interest in the welfare of the less privileged in our society. I do not believe that the reactions by some people - including some spokesmen for the Labor Party - have been fair. It is easy to take one comment without looking at the entire context of what he had to say. I am satisfied from reading the full article and also from comments that the minister has made to others which have been passed on to me - he is currently overseas - that the last thing Philip Ruddock intended was any offence to the indigenous people of this country. I do not believe the comments that have been made about it are reasonable. It is very easy on an issue like this to grab hold of a remark and to build up to a sense of moral indignation about it without giving credit to the context in which the remark was made and without giving any credit at all to the record of this particular minister. I repeat: he is a person of immense decency and compassion, he has a practical concern for the indigenous people of this country and he does not embrace the moral semantics on this issue that many in your party do, and I stand by the minister. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - A big build-up with a flat punchline, I thought, ending of course with a complete nonsensical -  - The Prime Minister reminds me that the Leader of the Opposition says that Mr Crean is the hard man of the Labor Party. The definition of a hard man in the Labor Party is: you produce a deficit of $10,200 million rather than $10,300 million. In relation to the fraudulent claims that have just been made, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition now says that he can isolate one day. He says, `If we take one day in the New Zealand dollar, we can see that there has been a movement on the Australian dollar more than the New Zealand dollar, but we can ignore three months, four months, five months, six months.' It is a totally fraudulent proposition that you would take one day. I would be quite happy to take one day in relation to currencies of my choice to prove the statistical point. I noticed that yesterday, in his wisdom, he also referred to a whole lot of currencies which are not even floating exchange rates.  - `Oh,' he says. One thing you will notice about a pegged currency is that it does not move. That is the idea of a pegged currency. To say, for example, in relation to the Vietnamese currency that it has not moved is basically to state the obvious: that is, it is a pegged currency - one of the other clever little observations of the Labor Party intelligentsia!While we are on the subject, one of the important things that the government believes is to continue its fiscal policy and to ensure that the Australian accounts are kept in surplus for a whole variety of reasons. I notice this is not the policy of the Australian Labor Party. Yesterday the Australian Labor Party proposed an unfunded $600 million cut in excise. It wants to cut R&amp;D. It wants to roll back the GST. Have we heard the `r' word in question time? Let's hear the `r' word in question time. In an unfunded way, it wants to spend more money on health, education and regions. It wants to spend more money on research. Oh, I forgot: it also wants to produce a bigger surplus. `BS' when it is applied to the Labor Party does not stand for `bigger surplus'; it stands for `bigger spending'. Nobody believes all of these claims. It is a completely opportunistic Labor Party. If it had any decency and it wanted to get credibility, it could mention the word `roll-back' - tell us when, how and how much. The markets would be very interested to know.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The statistics relating to private health insurance have been nothing short of spectacular and have gone beyond anyone's imagined success. Between 1 January 1999 and now, 2.25 million Australians at least have joined private health insurance. In the June quarter, 41.2 per cent of all Australians had private health insurance cover, and these statistics seriously underestimate the final figure because the 14-day extension of the period of grace for Lifetime Health Cover has brought a whole lot of extra people in, which will not show up until we get the September quarter figures in about four weeks time. This has been a lot of hard work and it really has turned around an industry that is an integral part of Australia's health care system.One thing that is interesting, though, is that the member for Hume asked about alternative views. In fact, this issue has probably united the ideological left of Australian politics more than any other issues in recent times. An extraordinary range of quotes can be found about the private health insurance rebate. These are some quotes I took out this morning: `increases the differential between the winners and losers', the `$500 million attack on the Commonwealth budget surplus', `fiscally careless', `completely failed', `subsidising a product that people don't want', `an expensive debacle', `a chain reaction of inflation which will see the benefits swallowed up', and `on economic and health policy grounds it is indefensible'. That sort of incredible prolonged barrage of abuse has in fact come from just one person: the shadow minister for health, the member for Jagajaga. Yesterday I told the House that she had put out 30 press releases critical of the private health insurance rebate. I was wrong. It is in fact 31. We found another one. That averages, between December 1998 and April 2000, one press release every 12 working days, not taking account of public holidays, Christmas and New Year. - It does not take into account rostered days off and it does not include one press release from the acting shadow minister for health because he just rehashed the shadow minister's arguments. I thought honourable members would find this interesting, so I have got them together and I will table them for their benefit. The other thing that is interesting is to look at the titles to get some idea of what they are after, and I am happy to read the titles of some of these press releases. Let me give you a sample: `Wooldridge fails to make case for private health rebate' - I have obviously done something much more successful since that came out; `Howard concedes the futility of the insurance rebate' - I must have missed that; `Public hospitals should come before extras'; `Health insurance bill: $1.7 billion down the drain'; `Assault on Medicare repeats history'; `Private health insurance woes continue'; `30% rebate a dismal failure'; `Health insurance not reducing the pressure on public hospitals'; `Premium rises too large and too soon'; and `Health rebate cost blow out caused by premium hikes not participation' - that was after the smallest premium increases in a decade, but that is another matter. For the benefit of honourable members, I have collated those and I will table that as well. It just makes it easier for referencing.When we look at this, the fact is that the shadow minister for health has been prepared to walk up and down the press gallery, briefing people off the record as to what the opposition's plans are with the private health insurance rebate and how they would like to abolish it. It has been sanctioned by the Leader of the Opposition. The simple fact is that on this area they have no credibility whatsoever. The member for Banks was prepared to resign over an issue of principle. The shadow minister for health obviously has no such principle. </DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition invites me to back Labor's plan. The only Labor plan I know of was to make diesel 24c a litre dearer for consumers. The only Labor plan that I know of is a plan to deny Australians $12 billion of personal income tax cuts. The only other Labor plan I know of is to cause untold confusion -  - I was asked a question about Labor's plan and I was also asked -  - Mr Speaker, the only Labor plan I know of in this area is to make diesel dearer for Australian farmers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. We on this side of the House know the simple fact that, if you look after our small business community, you will see higher living standards, higher wages and a stronger economy. That is why this government gives very high priority to the interests of small business. I must say that that is in contrast to the Labor Party, who had 17 inquiries into small business in 13 years and basically did nothing for small business except send a whole lot of them broke, particularly in the early 1990s. I am happy to say that things changed in 1996 dramatically and for the better when the Howard government was elected. One of the strong policy reforms that we introduced for the benefit of small business was to change the Trade Practices Act to make unlawful unconscionable conduct against small business. Not only did we change the law; we provided the ACCC with the funds to pursue appropriate cases to establish the law, to establish the rights of small business. So I am very pleased to be able to advise the House that, in a recent landmark decision in the Federal Court, the interests of small business were given the high priority that was intended by this parliament as initiated by the Howard government. The Federal Court decision said in respect of the new provisions of the act, which they recognised strengthened the act and strengthened protections for small business, that they would protect a small business from `unreasonable, unfair, bullying and thuggish behaviour'. `Hear, hear!' to the Federal Court and `Hear, hear!' to the Howard government that stood up for small business, and now we see the practical consequences of that support for the small business community. The ACCC, which took the action, said that they consider it to be an important decision `in assisting to better protect the interests of small business from excesses in conduct by bigger businesses'. The Labor Party never did this and were never prepared to work for small business. We came in, and here you see the consequences. I am asked: what alternative policies are there for small business? Well, there is the `r' word. We know the `r' word - the `roll-back' word, and of course that would be, as Della said - I have never met Della, but I must say he is now somebody whose judgment I appreciate -  - Yes, he is unforgettable, and he is dead right: that would be a nightmare in red tape for the small business community. That, of course, is why we have not heard the word `roll-back' since 21 July. The Leader of the Opposition is not interested since that happened; he cannot bring himself to say it again. The Labor Party has been in opposition now for four years, going on for five years. It is about time it produced a policy - other than roll-back - which would actually be of benefit to the small business community. The reason why this is such a low priority and why the portfolio languishes in the outer with an underling is that the real people who count in the Labor Party are of course the ACTU, with all the ACTU presidents sitting on the other side. Never forget what Labor's attitude to small business really is. In fact, out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition, he said on radio on 7 July this year:... we have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party, we have never pretended that.His words simply reflect his lack of action for the small business community. This is a great win for the small business community, and I can assure them that we are going to continue to back them because, if it is good for small business, it is good for the economy, good for jobs and good for Australia.</DOC>

 - I observe again the old ACTU trick, which is that you state a false premise on the belief that, if you state it often enough, it becomes accepted wisdom. We repudiate the old ACTU trick, and we repudiate the false premise that began the question. In relation to the indexation of excise, which, I think the Leader of the Opposition says, creates some kind of windfall, the point has been made on a number of occasions that, because the government indexes both its excises and its outlays, it does not actually get a windfall; it costs the Commonwealth money. That is, by indexing payments which are larger than excises and indexing excises, the ratio of payments out to revenues in is something like two to one. I think that is in the budget papers. I have asked before: is there anyone in this parliament who believes that we should not be indexing pensions? - Oh, we are on to bracket creep now. We are asked a question about indexing and excises, and we are on to bracket creep. Let us move immediately to bracket creep. I would have thought that the kings of the bracket creep would be a government that presided over an eight per cent inflation rate for 10 years in a row. - During the 1980s, the CPI averaged eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent for 10 years. Not only did that give bracket creep, but Labor indexed excise eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent for 10 years. It was only when this government came to office, when the CPI came down to one per cent, that figures like a three per cent or a 3¾ GST effect became meaningful. The Leader of the Opposition calls this 3¾ a spike - a one-off spike in February. What would you call eight per cent per annum for a decade? A mountain range; you are of Himalayan proportions. There was no one-off spike - it was eight per cent, on eight per cent, on eight per cent for 10 years, with discounting on the excise not once. And not only was there full indexation from 1983, and eight per cent per annum with no discounts because there were no spikes - it was a consistent mountain range - the Labor Party actually, voluntarily and discretionarily, increased the excise as well. It did not just rely on indexation, but with voluntary increases increased, from memory, five per cent on unleaded and seven per cent on leaded. If you had actually increased five per cent on unleaded and seven per cent on leaded, do you think you might have actually taken that spike out in your next indexation. Did the Labor Party ever do that?Here we are with a Labor Party policy, introduced in 1983, which produced an indexation factor of eight per cent per annum for 10 years. It is only when this government comes to office, keeps the system, produces one per cent, and you get a one-off 3¾, which is dwarfed by the Himalayan proportions of Labor performance, that the Labor Party suddenly gets interested in indexation. Every now and then you come across political opportunists. I have to say that, in this Olympics season, there are gold medals all round for the Labor Party frontbench.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real interest in what is happening to employment opportunities in regional areas, including his own in New England. Essentially there is some very positive news around, and that is, I know, welcomed right across rural and regional areas of the country. The June 2000 quarter edition of the small area labour market series, published by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, shows some quite widespread falls in unemployment figures, with particularly good results in non-metropolitan areas such as the Hunter; the North Coast region of New South Wales, where unemployment has been very high in historical terms; western Victoria; and the Riverina. While the figures, of course, jump around a little from time to time, there is no denying the very sound trend lines based on the economic management of this government. The national results for the month of August show that total employment has increased to a historical high of 9,141,800 under the coalition - 800,000 more than existed under Labor. Sixty per cent of that has been in full-time jobs. Since 1996, when we came to power, the number of jobs in non-metropolitan areas has increased by 175,000.Grateful as I am to the Parliamentary Library for the work that it does on estimating the unemployment rate in electorate divisions, I can point to the fact that the unemployment rate in the electorate of the member for New England, for example, was 6.7 per cent in June compared with 6.9 per cent in March - a solid downward trend. In Richmond the figure is still higher than we would like, at 12.3 per cent. But that compares with something like 20 per cent when the member was elected. In Bendigo, the rate is down from around 11 per cent to close to nine per cent; in Dawson, it is down from around 10.6 in March to 8.9 per cent now.  We have seen quite significant falls in many rural and regional communities, very welcome falls. Of course, they are underpinned not only by sound economic management but also by valuable reforms - for example, difficult as we know the relatively high fuel prices are at the moment, we have very significantly reduced the tax take, the tax burden, on transport. Jobs out in rural and regional areas depend upon export industries, and we have, for example, just completely abolished fuel excise on rail. We did not see the ALP doing that. We have completely abolished it. There is no fuel excise on rail. We know about the shadow Treasurer. Oh, we do. He said he favours the old, indirect tax mix - the old one. That means he presumably would want to put it back on under some version of roll-back, although we do not hear much about it. Even in relation to trucking, and we all know the stresses that exist at the moment, the reality is that, if the ALP were in power, the trucking industry would be paying 24c more for every litre of fuel they use. That is the reality. If the Labor Party were in power today, the trucking industry in this country would be paying 24c a litre more for every litre of fuel that they use. Of course, the other thing that has to be remembered about the export performance in the rural sector, which is the key to employment in rural and regional areas, is that, in terms of competitive advantage, we have just overseen a significant cut in the price of fuel relative to that of our competitors. We have not seen French farmers, for example, who have been blockading Paris and what have you, enjoying such a substantial reduction in taxation excise as we have presided over.The contrast just in that one area of economic management and taxation reform is stark enough. In more general terms, the only policy that is evident at all in relation to rural and regional Australia from those opposite is the obvious one of making it too expensive for anybody to live there.</DOC>

 - I do not accept those calculations. The reality is that the variation in fuel prices is a direct consequence of the trebling in world oil prices.  - The reality is this, if you take all of the policies into account. Take the reduction in excise on diesel. That is a fuel; it is a fuel that is used by a lot of people in Hamilton. Have you forgotten that we proposed, and you tried to block, a 24c a litre reduction in the price of fuel?  - Have you forgotten that, as a result of the operation of the GST, all tax paid on fuel used in a business is now fully rebatable - something that did not exist before the introduction of the goods and services tax? Mr Speaker, if you take into account what might have been the situation if the old taxation regime had obtained and superimpose that on the changes that have occurred in the price of fuel driven by variations in world fuel prices, I stand by the remarks I made. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. I can advise the House that, since 1 July, Commonwealth tax through excise on petrol and diesel has been reduced by $2.2 billion. - The opposition has been promulgating this proposition of some kind of revenue windfall out of excise. On 1 July, excise was cut by $2.2 billion. Let us make this point, which I think was made earlier -  - that, if the Labor Party had had its way and defeated that cut, the windfall to the Commonwealth government today would be $2.2 billion. This is another one of these negative windfalls; it is like their negative surpluses. It is a negative windfall of $2.2 billion.Yesterday the farmers made representations to the government about excise on fuel. I know that some of these points were made by the member for Groom and also by the member for Page, both of whom are practising farmers, I believe; they made them very well on the media in the last 24 hours. I will just go through it. For farmers using diesel in farm machinery - that is, off road - there is no excise; it cannot be cut. For farmers who are using transport - that is, from the farm gate to the port or, indeed, with their supplies coming from a city manufacturer up to the farm gate - the tax on the diesel used in those trucks was cut 24c a litre from 1 July. You might argue that it could have been cut 25c; it was cut 24c. If it had not been for this government, it would have been cut zero. For farmers who use petrol in business - that is, they might have a vehicle which uses petrol for the business - because they get an input tax credit, they get a cut effectively of one-eleventh on the petrol price.The only area in which farmers can be paying the same amounts of tax as a result of reform would be as consumers of petrol, like every other Australian: where they are using petrol vehicles for private purposes. That is the only area. Like every other Australian who can take the advantage under the new tax system of income tax cuts, company tax cuts or capital gains tax cuts, they get those benefits.When you isolate that out it is clear that, under the new tax system, not only are farmers not suffering any disadvantage but also they have been given substantial advantages. That was a central part of the tax package. That point was made no better than by the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Ian Donges. He said in an address at a GST and tax reform seminar on 19 July 1999:NFF has particularly welcomed the inclusion in the package of reductions in the excise on diesel fuel. - The interjection is whether I met with him yesterday - and I did, as it turns out. - Yes, Mr Speaker. But let me add in another thing which I had forgotten until I pulled out the speech from Mr Donges at Yass - and I think it was made by the member for Page on television this morning. Mr Donges said:The long overdue cuts in excise will lift some of the burden on country people by reducing the costs of farmers' inputs. Our grain farmers particularly will welcome the considerable reductions which will flow from the complete removal of excise on rail fuel.This is Mr Donges:We have estimated that the value of removing all rail excise would mean an extra $1.60 per tonne in grain farmers' pockets. There are other estimates that say it could be as high as $2. So no tax off road, a 24c reduction on road and no excise on rail - the complete removal of excise on diesel for rail.When you hear the Labor Party get up and ask questions about fuel, you have got to start from this premise: if they had had their way, diesel on road would be 24c a litre higher today and there would be diesel on rail. That is where they come from. Yesterday the Labor Party said, `Oh, we actually now believe in a freeze of 2c next February on petrol excise' - at a cost of $600 million, completely unfunded. Did the Labor Party say, `And to fund that, we will steal back from the farmers the 24c a litre cut in diesel'? Did the Labor Party say, `We will put the excise back on rail'? Did the Labor Party say, `We will increase income tax'? Did the Labor Party say, `We will increase the company tax'? No, it is just another unfunded promise - from somebody who today was feigning an interest in the exchange rate - to add to all of their other unfunded promises. Roll-back? We have $600 million on fuel excise, and they cannot tell you where any of this money is coming from - more money on the regions, more money on this, more money on that, more money everywhere.But the explanation as to how this is to be done is really in the Financial Review of 14 August 2000 - a very important date. I rub this close to my chest because it explains how it is all going to be done. They have got a $600 million cut in excise. They have an unfunded roll-back, the dimensions of which we have not yet heard because the Leader of the Opposition cannot now pronounce the word `roll-back'. We have more spending on everything that moves - we have apparently got more spending on R&amp;D and more spending on universities - and do you know how it is all going to be done? With bigger surpluses. `Labor pledges budget surpluses'. As I said earlier, `BS Crean'standing for `bigger spending'.Back in the days of responsible opposition in this country, you would not be allowed to run around with that kind of opportunistic, unfunded political pap. But the standards of opposition in this country have now gone so low under the Leader of the Opposition that he is allowed to emit anything that comes into his mind. Here we are with a completely unfunded program which nobody takes an interest in because nobody believes it. Yesterday's `2c a litre, $600 million' unfunded promise in relation to indexation from the party that gave you indexation at eight per cent per annum right throughout the 1980s has been treated with the complete disinterest which it deserves. It would never happen, and nobody believes it.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of this individual, but it is important to note that the savings bonus, which of course was substantially criticised by the Australian Labor Party, has been paid to 1.68 million older Australians. Fifty-seven per cent of those people have received the full $1,000 bonus, and we have seen 72 per cent of those Australians who have received a bonus receive beyond $500. Of course, this is on top of the four per cent increase that we gave on 1 July and the recent indexation treatments. Regarding individual cases, if the member for Lilley has an individual case, I am quite happy to take that up.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question and recognise her interest in these issues. The people of Yugoslavia voted clearly and decisively at their elections on 24 September for a change of government. The Yugoslav government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced four days later that no candidate had won an absolute majority and that a second round of voting, which would be on 8 October, would be needed to determine the election outcome. It is the government's view that this announcement of the commission's figures is at variance with other highly reliable counts, counts which were very much in favour of the opposition. In concert with a number of other governments, including that of the United States and governments of the European Union, I have urged President Milosevic to respect the will of the Yugoslav people, and the Australian government joins with other governments in encouraging President Milosevic to stand down from office immediately.The government is deeply concerned about the risk of violence if President Milosevic continues to cling to power and about the threat this risk poses to the many dual national Australians who live in Yugoslavia. On 3 October, the Australian Ambassador in Belgrade met with the opposition presidential candidate, Mr Kostunica, and conveyed Australia's support for a peaceful change of government to reflect the clear will of the Yugoslav voters. Mr Kostunica greatly appreciates Australia's support, and he has said that it is important for the Yugoslav people to know they have the backing of Australia and the backing of the international community. As I said, the Australian government joins with other governments in looking to President Milosevic to stand down, to recognise the result of the election and to recognise that he no longer commands the support of his own people, that he does not command the support of the international community and that it would be in his people's best interest for him to concede power.</DOC>

 - I take it that LRP is leaded petrol. - I thank the honourable member for his question and thank his constituent Mr Dukes. The differential in excise between unleaded and leaded petrol was introduced in the 1993 budget. From 18 August 1993, the excise on unleaded petrol was increased by 5c per litre - it was not indexed; it was legislated, just a straight increase of 5c. The excise on leaded petrol was increased - not indexed - by 7c per litre. The actual absolute level was increased, that fed into the CPI and then the CPI was used to index it at the next indexing point. I am asked whether the reason was that older cars use leaded petrol and it was done on environmental grounds. I heard that said at the time, but the real reason was that the Labor government in that 1993 election won the election by promising income tax cuts without a GST and, when they went into the August 1993 election with the budget then haemorrhaging in the vicinity of $10 billion or more and realised that they could neither afford the income tax cuts nor keep their commitment against the GST in the 1993 budget, they took away the income tax cuts, they hiked every level of wholesale sales tax by two per cent and they increased the unleaded excise by 5c per litre and the leaded excise by 7c per litre. Those of us who were here at the time heard it said that this was done for environmental reasons, and I suppose that could have been the reason for the differential, but the reason for the 5c and 7c increases - rather than, say, 0c and 2c or, if you just wanted a differential, a cut of 2c and the other one maintained at the standard - was that the Australian Labor Party had got the budget in such terrible circumstances that they were increasing taxes on everything in that. Those of us who were here at the time regret that very much, but that occurred in 1993. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his interest in the contribution that senior Australians continue to make to the welfare of Australia. I am pleased to say that, within the last hour, the Prime Minister announced that the Senior Australian of the Year for this year is Professor Freda Briggs. Professor Briggs is an outstanding Australian and I will read just briefly from her CV. In her roles as educator, author, scholar and ambassador, she has ceaselessly and passionately worked towards her vision to provide for a safer and more caring world for children. She is the recipient of the inaugural Australian Humanitarian Award, the Anzac Fellowship award, the Jean Denton Memorial Fellowship and the Creswick Foundation Fellowship award for her work for disadvantaged children.Professor Briggs follows the inaugural holder of this award - this award was created by this government in the International Year of Older Persons - and that was Slim Dusty, who led us at the closing ceremony of the Olympics in a rousing rendition of Waltzing Matilda, the like of which I do not think we have heard before. Recognising and introducing the Senior Australian of the Year awards was to complete the trilogy of Australian of the Year, Young Australian of the Year and Senior Australian of the Year. It is interesting to note that there were 1,500 nominations for the position of Senior Australian of the Year, and that is more than the other two awards have attracted from the people. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is asking: what electorate does Professor Briggs come from? I am delighted to tell him that she is from his electorate. In acknowledging the second Senior Australian of the Year, it is important to acknowledge that the award is now sponsored by the Commonwealth Bank, News Ltd Suburban and Network Ten, and it is copresented by the National Australia Day Council and the National Seniors Association. This award has been taken to the hearts of the Australian people and, in awarding this award to Professor Briggs, we acknowledge that she will be an ambassador for the continuing contribution of senior Australians to Australia and our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. The government will have that issue before us in the next couple of weeks. The review of the Northern Territory land rights, as I recall it, essentially arises out of an inquiry conducted into the operation of the act by the former Labor member for the Northern Territory Mr John Reeves QC. He produced a very comprehensive report. We will take into account his recommendations and we will also take into account, as we always do in these matters, our obligations to all of the Australian people.  - We will take into account our obligations to all of the Australian people -  - and the sort of issues raised by -  - We will take careful note of what Mr Reeves had to say. Mr Reeves is a person who enjoys considerable respect and I would have thought that the views that he has expressed on this matter would command respect within the Australian Labor Party, as he was a member of this House of the Australian Labor Party. I do not know whether he is still a member of the Labor Party or not - that is his business - but he is a person who does not come to these matters with any particular axe to grind. He does not come to these matters wanting to do hurt or injustice to the indigenous people of the Northern Territory and therefore we will be very carefully guided by what he has had to say.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question, because it does give me an opportunity to report on some of the achievements of this government in the area of research and development and on its support for innovation in agriculture, which contrasts very sharply with the attitude of the opposition, whose view it is that there is no role for innovation in agriculture. - Indeed, it responds also to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday about Australia's performance in research and development. This government is providing about $170 million a year for agricultural research and development. That has increased by about 10 per cent per annum under the auspices of this government. There has been a real commitment to increasing research and development in agriculture because we recognise the potential that innovation has to boost our rural production. It is interesting to note that all of our major industries have research and development levies which are supported by the government - horticulture, the red meat industry, the pork industry, the wool industry. But, even in much smaller industries, we have promoted research into crocodile farming and emu farming - some of that in the electorate of the honourable member for Herbert - and research into things like culinary herbs, coffee and the like, all of which have the potential to open up new industries.Today I extended an invitation to wool growers to take up the offer for shares in their new research and development company, which will be established as a result of legislation before the parliament at the present time. As a result of these arrangements, wool growers will be able to take the responsibility for the ownership of their own services company and to take a leadership role in directing research and development in that really key national industry. My colleague the Minister for Forestry and Conservation recently announced the doubling of the government's contribution towards research and development in the forest industry. For a long time there has been an anomaly, introduced by Labor, that the forestry industry received only half the support for their levies that other industries received. This government is rectifying that issue. In addition, we have introduced the new innovation fund for agriculture, and the first round of applications for that closed last Friday. So we are making a very real commitment to supporting research and development. Sadly, Labor does not match us in that regard. This government has played a key role in promoting particularly biotechnology, and indeed last night, I think it was, the Prime Minister presented science awards to some Australian scientists who are leading the way in gene technology and demonstrating clearly that there is a real capacity for Australia to lead the world in this research.  - I notice the Leader of the Opposition is not able to keep his mouth closed, because I know he has the embarrassment of the Tasmanian government, his Labor colleagues in Tasmania, who are trying to shut gene technology research out of Australia. They want Tasmanian farmers locked up in a time warp way behind the developments that are occurring in the rest of Australia. It is important that Australia remain up to date in research and development. This government is backing research and development. We will develop the knowledge nation. Under the Beazley government, it would be a Beazley backwater, because there is no interest in research and development and no commitment to building better industry in this country.</DOC>

 - I have not misled the people who listen to that very fine program and, I am advised, in increasing numbers at 8.30 on Friday morning every fortnight.Government member - Are you on commission? - No, I am not. As always, when I am asked a question based on something I am alleged to have said, I always take the precautionary measure of saying I will have a look at what I actually said. But I can say to the member for Dobell that I welcome his interest in the new schools policy of the government. I think it is of advantage to this country that we have a debate on government funding for both government and independent schools. One of the things that I am unconditionally proud of is the fact that, because the government I lead abolished the old new-schools policy, it is now possible, for example, for the Anglican Church to build  low fee schools in the western suburbs of Sydney. - The great virtue of the change that we have made is that it is now possible for working-class families in the western suburbs of Sydney to aspire to an education choice which goes beyond a government school and a Catholic systemic school. - I repeat, to the obvious discomfort of the Labor Party, that the great virtue of our new policy is that it is now possible for the first time for many thousands of working-class families all around Australia - and I quote the western suburbs of Sydney as an example, but that opportunity is replicated in similar parts of the country - as a result of a change that we got through the parliament only with the support of Senator Harradine - and I record my gratitude to Senator Harradine for the support that he gave to us three or four years ago; the Labor Party voted against giving the working-class families of the western suburbs of Sydney this opportunity - to choose to send their children not to a high fee private school but to a low fee private school. I would like the member for Dobell to go into those areas of Western Sydney where low fee independent schools have been opened up over the last few years. We have given more choice not to wealthy families but to battling working-class families. That is what the Leader of the Opposition finds so distasteful about our policy. Our new funding policy does something that the Labor Party hates, and that is it confers choice on working-class families in Australia. - I continue: the choice that we have given to working-class families in the western suburbs of Sydney is only one element of the new system. The SES policy which has been introduced by the minister is fairer than the old ERI system. It is based on a school community's capacity to pay. The 63 schools serving the neediest communities will receive an average increase of $207 per student next year, rising to $966 by the year 2004. This is five times the increase flowing to the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities, which will receive $43 extra per student next year and $198 by the year 2004. SES funded schools serving the wealthiest communities receive per student 13 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. This compares to schools serving the neediest communities that will now receive up to 70 per cent of the average cost of educating a child at a government school. The maximum has been increased from the present 56 per cent for primary students and 62.4 per cent for secondary students.This new policy of the government is a win, win, win again for every section of the Australian community. This government has not only presided over increases in funding to government schools and guaranteed the position of the Catholic systemic schools but also opened up choice and opportunity for tens of thousands of working families in Australia. These working families want a choice to send their children to independent schools, and it can only be a choice if it is an affordable choice. Under the old Labor policy if you were not able to afford to send your children to an established independent school in a city like Sydney and you did not want to send your child to a Catholic systemic school you had no alternative other than to send your child to a government school. What we have done is open up choice. We are giving people choice. It has always been a cardinal principle of our education policy that we will give people maximum choice. We will support the government school sector. The government school sector has served this country extremely well and continues to do so, and I speak from very strong and appreciative personal experience of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and his interest in this matter. Becoming a global financial centre means exporting financial services from Australia to the Asian region in particular and obviously to the world. While the financial services sector represents seven per cent of the Australian economy, it also makes up just one per cent of exports. Agriculture and mining combined also represent about seven per cent of the Australian economy, but they represent around 50 per cent of Australia's exports. Since 1998 our primary objective has therefore been to put Australia on the list when international companies have thought about setting up financial services operations into Asia. Previously Australia was seen as a separate market from Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, even though we have undertaken very significant economic reforms, including very significant taxation reform which has been very well received. We have set out to try to improve the understanding of Australia in the international media, combined with face-to-face discussions with executives.The Olympics have unquestionably delivered to Australia unprecedented opportunities for the development of a financial centre. In Sydney recently there were 17,000 sports journalists, but more importantly for a financial centre extensive media coverage was provided by 3,200 non-sport journalists, who delivered coverage in the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, Bloombergs, CNBC, CNN and a range of financial publications across the world. This has reassured global executives of companies that have moved operations to Australia over the last two years. To name a few of these, banks like UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, JP Morgan and Citigroup have recently established regional operations in Australia. Funds managers like HSBC and Deutsche Asset Management have moved regional operations to Australia, meaning that decisions about tens of billions of dollars of investment in Asia are now made from Melbourne and Sydney. Moreover, Vanguard, Schroders and GE Capital have expanded Asian funds management operations to service the region.During the Olympics, Goldman Sachs announced that their Asia-Pacific e-commerce headquarters will be in Australia. This follows the announcement by Lab Morgan, which is the technology arm of JP Morgan, that their e-commerce hub for Asia will be in Australia. Deutsche Bank also announced that one of only two world foreign exchange hubs will be in Australia - the other one being in London. All these companies cited Australian technology and human capital as key influences on their decisions. I might add that the Prime Minister's visit to London in July significantly assisted in bringing those operations to Australia.But the true benefit of the Olympics will be delivered in the next few months and the next few years. Already Charles Schwab and ING and HSPC Internet Bank have indicated that they will be opening operations here before Christmas. It is no use having a company like Visa bringing 300 international banking executives to Australia for the Olympics with only a good impression to leave behind. I will be joining with the Invest Australia crew, Access Australia and the state governments to increase the tempo of our promotion to offshore investors over the next few months and next few years. We want more jobs, more business and more investment in Australia, and no doubt the Olympics are going to provide us with an even better story to tell.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the member for Blair for his continuing interest in the workers in his electorate who rely on the forest industry to keep their families. The Courier-Mail of 29 September has reported the closure of the Nandroya sawmill in Cooroy in Queensland, and reports the mill as being the biggest hardwood mill in that state. As a result of that closure, 60 workers immediately lost their jobs. The balance of 20 will be dismissed in April. Furthermore, at the same time the North Ipswich mill has retrenched 37 workers because of its imminent closure. Both these mills were once the property of Boral. If one reads the media reports it could mistakenly be thought that the firm Boral has been sacking these workers. In fact, those of us who follow the regional forest processes in Queensland know that the Queensland government spent $14 million of taxpayers' money to buy those sawmills with one purpose in mind and one purpose only: to close them down and sack the workers who were employed there. Their policy was to swap those workers' jobs for a few lousy Green preferences at the next election. Furthermore, at that time Mr Beattie, the Premier, promised 400 new jobs which have not materialised. Included in those 400 jobs that were supposed to materialise were 100 new Department of Primary Industry forestry jobs in the new reserves that were being created, yet when we look at the new budget for Queensland - the 2000-01 budget - do we find provision for 100 new jobs? No, we find a report on the sacking of 96 DPI forestry workers. I drew to the attention of the House the other day the troubles recognised by green activists in America as arising from fires - including deaths and property damage - caused by insufficient appropriate management of reserve forests. It is a great question for Australia, but how do you achieve that when you are sacking the keepers of the forest, not adding to their numbers as you promised when you did a deal on these things?When it became obvious that the Cooroy mill was to be closed down, the member for Fairfax arranged for me to go to the Noosa council and discuss with them opportunities to get some protection for those workers. That member worked extremely hard. I have just drawn to your attention that another mill that was also known to be closing at that time was North Ipswich, but have I had any representations from the member for Oxley? Not one. In fact, I have to look around to see which one he is - I could not recognise him. -  - It is not in Blair; it is in North Ipswich in Oxley, and the member for Oxley has not got an interest in it. Isn't it amazing: although the sawmill is in North Ipswich the workers most likely live in the electorate of Oxley, and these blokes think it is a big joke because those workers have just lost their jobs! The member for Oxley is also a Queenslander, and he does not care. -  - The Howard government has a very clear response, in great contradiction to the things that the Beattie government promised and is not doing; that is, I have announced a $5 million program to try to address some of the problems in the Queensland timber industry resulting entirely from the circumstances of the reduction in resource that was unnecessary scientifically. As far as we can see, the only increase that the Beattie government is able to achieve in Queensland is extra numbers on the electoral roll. </DOC>

 - I can see no evidence or reason at the moment that I should have an inquiry, for the simple reason that I believe the Health Insurance Commission to be adequately looking into the matter. If the shadow minister understood a little bit more about her portfolio, she would realise that this is governed by legislation introduced by the Labor Party in the late 1980s - it was a response to the deficiencies shown up in Public Accounts Committee report No. 236 into pathology in 1986 - and it separates the whole process of investigation of fraud and overservicing from the political process. If the member for Jagajaga had been around a little bit longer she would understand that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for including links to employment service sites run by my department on his own Gary Nairn web site, which he launched so successfully just last week. Australia is now a world leader in the online delivery of employment services. Five years ago a job seeker in a CES office had access to a few hundred job cards on notice boards at most. Today, thanks to the Australian Job Search database administered by my department, job seekers have access to more than 50,000 jobs right around Australia. Thanks to the Job Outlook function, job seekers can obtain details on employment prospects, training requirements and wage rates for more than 400 different occupations. Also, the Australian Job Search contains more than 50,000 resumes which means that it operates as a virtual online labour exchange. Job seekers can still receive personalised help at more than 2,000 Job Network offices around the country. That is more offices than ever before. Every day job seekers are making some half a million job searches on touch screens run by my department. They are making more than 100,000 job searches every day on the Internet, and job seekers can access the Internet at well over half of the Centrelink offices around the country.Recently the government announced a new cooperative arrangement with the Recruitment and Consulting Services Association, which has more than 900 member organisations. This arrangement means that for job seekers there is access to thousands more jobs; it means for employers there is access to tens of thousands of potential employees. Meanwhile, all the opposition can offer is a downloaded copy of an already superseded document called Workforce 2010, which they wanted the government to post out to schools. It is old-fashioned, old economy, old Labor. The Leader of the Opposition is supposed to have a good mind, but he can never make it up on anything. </DOC>

 - Obviously, with a question like that, I would have to go and look at the list before I gave a specific answer. But the basis of the question of course is to continue the mythology of the Labor Party attack on the government - that is, that in some way the policies of this government are designed to help the wealthy schools of this country. The policies of this government are designed to promote choice. I wonder whether the Labor Party continues to oppose the opening of schools like the Thomas Hassall Anglican College in Hoxton Park in the western suburbs of Sydney where, I am advised, the fees for a primary school student are $2,200 a year and for a secondary school student $2,600 a year. There are many working families in Australia who are willing to make the sacrifice to send their children to schools with that fee structure but have no hope of being able to afford to send their children to schools that have a higher fee structure. It is schools like the Thomas Hassall Anglican College in Hoxton Park that are exemplars of the new schools policy which you voted against. - I have finished. </DOC>

 - I am grateful to the honourable member for Moreton for asking me that question because it gives me an opportunity to state very clearly the approach that the government has taken in relation to the sale of Telstra. The government has been totally honest and up front in respect of the sale of Telstra. Before the 1996 election, we indicated quite clearly to the Australian public that we would sell one-third of Telstra, and we did. Before the 1998 election, we indicated quite clearly to the Australian public that we would not sell more than 49 per cent of Telstra until such time as an independent inquiry reported on the adequacy of service levels, and we have kept that commitment as well. On that basis, I noted with some interest statements made by Labor over the past several months. I note that on 18 April last the Leader of the Opposition promised: No Labor government presided over by me will continue the privatisation of Telstra, full stop. I also noted the documents flying out of the Labor Party national conference held in July in Hobart. Those documents stated:Labor opposes the sale of Telstra and will not sell any further portion of the company. I did not believe that, and I do not believe that the Australian people should believe it any longer either, because we know that the Leader of the Opposition is the man who privatised Qantas, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Commonwealth Bank. He would sell Telstra in a minute. If we once had suspicions about this, we no longer do because this has been confirmed. Labor is hatching a secret plan to privatise Telstra, and that plan is revealed in the 8 September edition of Telco Weekly. This is a publication issued by that pre-eminent investment house Macquarie Bank, and it states clearly that Labor is actively considering the break-up and privatisation of Telstra. Let me quote from the Macquarie report:The ALP is considering such a break-up for Telstra. Our discussions with senior members of the Opposition has indicated that a split between Telstra's network and its retail businesses is an option being considered by the ALP.It goes on:It has been mooted that the government could 100% own the network business. The retail business could then be either fully or partially privatised.The report states further:... such an idea was discussed by the previous ALP government when Paul Keating was Prime Minister.So the whistle has been blown on Labor. The whistle has been blown on the Leader of the Opposition. They are representing to the Australian people that they are opposed to the sale of Telstra - to `any further portion' of Telstra were the words of the Leader of the Opposition - but at the same time they have been holding clandestine meetings with investment bankers on how to break up and sell off the company.I think it is time that the Leader of the Opposition confirmed to the Australian people what the true position of Labor is. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean on the details of any plans to break up and sell off Telstra, to come clean on why unnamed senior members of the opposition are discussing with investment banks the break-up of Telstra, and to disclose which senior members of the opposition have discussed the break-up of Telstra with Macquarie Bank. There is some degree of continuity in those words in that particular report of a certain author who sits on the front bench of the opposition. Some particular theme runs through that. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean. I do not expect an answer from the Leader of the Opposition. He has a convenient memory about his attendances at meetings where the sell-off or break-up of Telstra is discussed. We see here a grubby, politically expedient approach by the opposition on the sale of Telstra, and that of course is something that the Australian people deserve the truth on, just as they deserve the truth on roll-back, and we never hear about that. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition told the Australian people what he really will do if he ever gets the opportunity in government. It is the old story: say one thing when you are in opposition, but, if you ever get a chance at government, in one minute you will be flogging off Telstra, as that report proves. I table Telco Weekly. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his attempt - I think at his great political cost - to polarise this debate within the Australian community. The debate is about freedom of choice for parents, not the creation of an envy driven society, which is precisely the attempt which is being made. The Leader of the Opposition rails about need. I think the Leader of the Opposition should try to justify a policy approach by his party that would deny to working families in the western suburbs of Sydney the opportunity of sending their children to an independent school of their choice, which is what our policy is about. Our policy is about expanding options for parents. Our policy is not about aggregating comparisons of schools; rather, it is about expanding choice for Australian parents. I am very proud of the fact that Australian parents now have a lot more choice than they had under the policies of the former government. The reality is that, no matter what policy you have, there will always be a capacity by some parents in this country to send their children to schools like the school referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. That is a choice which is exercised by parents throughout Australia. That has always been there and it will always be there irrespective of the schools policy.The new element that this government has introduced, the new area of choice that we have introduced, is that we have created an opportunity for working families to exercise the option of choice. It is under this government that the option for working families to send their children to independent schools has been expanded. Schools like the Anglican school at Hoxton Park, with fees of $2,600 a year, would not have been possible under the policies of the Labor Party, and it was only the coalition, with the help of Senator Harradine, that brought about a change in the policy.We have in this country an education system that increasingly is enabling people to exercise choice. It is based upon a strong government school system, and it is a government school system with which I am personally very familiar - just as familiar with, or more familiar with, than are many who sit opposite and who choose to pretend that they are the sole defenders of the government school system in this country. We need a strong government school system. The government school system has made an outstanding contribution to this country, and it has produced outstanding people in all walks of Australian life. But what this government has additionally done - and what the Labor Party hates because the teacher unions hate it - is to provide choice to those people who want to send their children to non-government schools. Labor wants a school system permanently set in the model of an elite group of GPS schools in the government system, the Catholic systemic system and nothing else. This government wants to preserve and strengthen those three existing elements, but to introduce a new area of choice. It is no surprise that the fastest growing area, as I understand it, in the area of education is not at the very top, not the so-called elite schools, but this new group of independent schools, which reflects the growing desire of aspirational Australia to exercise educational options - the growing desire of aspirational Australia to exercise education options which we are catering for, which are providing people with more choice and which is a policy which I believe is to the long-term benefit of the Australian community. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I think it is well known that the government believes that Telstra, the telecommunications company, would be suited for private share ownership by the millions of Australians who want to invest in the stock market. With the proceeds of that, what this government does is pay off debt - free Australia from the Labor debt which would have otherwise chained us for generations. Just as Labor ran up $80 billion of debt in its last five budgets, so the coalition has paid off already $43 billion - and, by the end of this financial year, $50 billion - of the $80 billion Labor debt. That is freeing young people in the future from the effects of Labor wanton mismanagement.There has been a lot of talk in the community recently about Australia's future as a new economy in the area of IT and telecommunications. I cannot help but observe that the Labor Party, which would have you believe that it understands the new economy, as evidence of its commitment to the economy comes out with its first central key plank: the nationalisation of the phone company. You can imagine how this is received in the investment houses of New York when the Labor Party would walk in and say, `And just to illustrate how committed we are to a new economy, what we believe in is nationalisation in the telephone industry' - a complete contradiction of terms. I have hitherto actually thought that maybe the Labor Party did believe in the continued nationalisation of the telephone company. But I was rather taken with what has just been revealed to the House by the Minister for Finance and Administration in the Telco Weekly which he read out - and it bears reading again; it is very revealing. It says this:Our discussions with senior members of the Opposition has indicated that a split between Telstra's network and its retail business is an option being considered by the ALP. It has been mooted that the government could 100% own the network business. The retail business could then be either fully or partially privatised.Macquarie make this comment - I think it is a good comment:The current state of the polls indicates that the views of the ALP should be considered by investors.In other words, the ALP ought to come clean to investors on what it would do if it got into government. There are people who are making financial decisions at the moment. It goes on to say:Note that such an idea was discussed by the previous ALP government when Paul Keating was Prime Minister.It begs the question: who was the senior member of the opposition who met with Macquarie Bank? Who was the senior member of the opposition who met with Macquarie Bank? If the Leader of the Opposition wants to deny this, perhaps he could deny that a senior member of the opposition ever met with Macquarie Bank. I happen to believe that the senior member of the opposition who met with Macquarie Bank could almost be within arm's reach of the Leader of the Opposition right at this moment. If he wants to say that the Labor Party would never privatise Telstra, could he please explain why senior members of the opposition are going around investment houses talking about its break-up? We could launch another inquiry. You know we are having this inquiry into the frontbencher who said that Aboriginal affairs was like a toilet cleaner on the Titanic. We are still awaiting the results of that inquiry. We could add to that inquiry another inquiry where the Leader of the Opposition could go and inquire as to who was down talking to Macquarie Bank. He would probably show all of the energy that he is showing in his attempts to try to get to who the shadow minister was who made the comment about the Titanic.But this is the last piece in the puzzle of something that has been worrying me for quite some time. I said to the House yesterday that there is a clipping, which I hold close to my chest on a regular basis, from the Financial Review of 14 August 2000 in which Labor pledged bigger budget surpluses - as I have said, `BS Crean, bigger surplus Crean.' In that we had the famous `Simply Simon' interview. The `Simply Simon' interview read as follows:At the same time - This is speaking of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition:he is also grappling with contradictory elements -  - Listen to this!  - He is yelling as loud as he can; they are both yelling as loudly as they can to try to drown this out.  - I have never known somebody who wanted to drown out his own words. All I am doing is quoting you and you are yelling at the top of your voice to drown out yourself. The words were the following -  - Mr Speaker, he is yelling still at full pelt and people who are watching this may not know that the deputy leader is trying to drown out himself. He said this:... At the same time he is also grappling with contradictory elements of Labor policy such as those relating to the sale of Telstra and GST. He goes off the record quite often to express a personal view.I bet he goes off the record to express a personal view on Telstra. If he really believed that Telstra never would be broken up and never would be privatised, why would he go off the record? He would presumably just say on the record, `Telstra will never be privatised and Telstra will never be broken up.' Why would you go off the record when you were grappling with Labor's contradictory position on Telstra? There may be some Labor Party backbenchers who actually believe - when they hear the Leader of the Opposition say that he does not intend to privatise Telstra - that that is what would happen if he ever got elected. But those of us who have been here remember him saying over and over again that the Commonwealth Bank would never be privatised. We also remember that, on the eve of the 1995-96 budget, without telling the caucus, the decision was announced in that budget to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. Do you know who was informed before the Labor Party? We were informed, Mr Speaker. The Labor Party came to us to get our support to privatise the Commonwealth Bank - which it had pledged never to do - over the opposition of its own Labor backbench.We have seen it before. We know what happens. There is no logical explanation for a frontbencher to be in Macquarie Bank making these inquiries. There is no logical reason for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to go off the record with his private views in relation to Telstra, except for one thing, and that is we know they did it in the past and they will do it again.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the member for Groom that, in a word, the economic benefits flowing from the government's policy of privatisation have been `immense'. That is why the coalition parties not only since being in government but also when in opposition have been absolutely up-front in their support for policies of privatisation.One of the ironies of this whole debate about privatisation and one of the things that underlines the utter hypocrisy particularly of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue is that, when the Labor Party in government sought against its election commitments and in repudiation of its election commitments to privatise government business undertakings, it would not have been able to do so without the cooperation of the then coalition in opposition. I certainly remember conversations I had with the now Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance on the eve of a budget when he sought the support of the coalition in opposition in relation to the privatisation of one of the government business undertakings. Without our support, that would never have materialised.But the advantages of privatisation are significant. Privatisation of Telstra, the continuation of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and other privatisations carried out by the coalition government have greatly facilitated the reduction of the debt run up by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance. We have taken about $43 billion out of the $80 billion of debt or more that we inherited in 1996. As a result, this country now has probably the lowest, if not one of the lowest, government debt to GDP ratios of any country in the world. We have reduced it from a level of 20 per cent of GDP to a figure of 8½ per cent of GDP. That has greatly strengthened the economy, and it is one of the reasons why privatisation is an extremely good policy.We have also seen massive spending initiatives made possible by the privatisation of Telstra. We had the Natural Heritage Trust, worth $1.25 billion. We had Networking the Nation, worth $250 million. Out of the Telstra social bonus, we have had $1 billion - that was out of the sale of the second tranche of Telstra. That has provided untimed local calls in extended zones - $150 million. The extension of SBS in TV black spots to $120 million. Rural transaction centres - $70 million. Local government fund - $45 million. Expanded mobile phone coverage on major highways - $25 million. Tele-communications for remote and isolated islands - $20 million. And connecting Tasmanian schools - $15 million. All of those initiatives were opposed by the Labor Party, yet it does not stop Labor premiers like Jim Bacon turning up at the launch of telecommunications initiatives in Tasmania and seeking to share the limelight with the federal government. Labor say, `We will vote against it; we think it is absolutely terrible policy,' but when it comes to actually announcing an initiative which has been won for the people of Tasmania by the coalition and Senator Harradine and opposed by the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party Jim Bacon waltzes along and says, `Don't leave me out, John. Make sure I am on the platform. Let me share the limelight in the announcement.' Steve Bracks does exactly the same thing, and Bob Carr does exactly the same thing. It is therefore no surprise to me to learn that a senior member of the Labor Party frontbench, who I think might be studying his brief at the moment in relation to the next question, should have been talking to Macquarie Bank about Labor plans for privatisation. Everybody around this building knows that, if Labor win the next election, they will find a reason to ditch their opposition of the sale of Telstra. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows that, just as they did it with the Commonwealth Bank, just as they did it with Qantas, just as they did it in relation to Australian Airlines, they will do it in relation to Telstra. They have done it before; they will do it again. If it is possible to have one policy in opposition and a completely different one in government, you can be absolutely certain that that is exactly what the Australian Labor Party are going to do. They are total, rolled gold hypocrites on this issue, and the Australian public knows it.</DOC>

 - As always with these, I will check the figures. It may well be that the base grants, the point from which you are starting before you add the additional amount, explain those differences. I think you will find out that they probably do, but as always I will have those figures checked, and if there is anything further I should inform the House of I will. As the member for Dobell has asked me a question about the government's new funding approach for schools, let me take him through the details of it. Let him be reminded that the state grants funding for schools bill contains the highest ever level of funding for government schools. A record $8.6 billion in Commonwealth funds will be spent on government schools, and that is an increase of 18 per cent on 1997. In this current year alone, total direct Commonwealth funding to government schools is $2 billion, and this is $402 million more than in Labor's last year of office. That is an increase of 26 per cent.The new SES policy, which we have introduced, is much fairer than the old ERI system. It is very much based on a school's capacity to pay. Under that policy, the 63 schools serving the neediest communities will receive an average increase - and I invite the member for Dobell to listen to this - of $207 per student next year, rising to $966 by the year 2004. This is five times the increase flowing to the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities, who will receive $43 extra per student next year and $198 by the year 2004. Schools serving lower SES communities - that is, the schools with SES scores of 100 or less - and the Catholic systemic schools will receive over 79 per cent of government funding, while the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities will receive only 2.3 per cent of Commonwealth funding. SES funded schools serving the very wealthiest communities receive per student 13.7 per cent of the total cost of educating a child at a government school. This compares with schools serving the neediest communities, which will now receive up to 70 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. This maximum has been increased from the present 56 per cent obtained in earlier years for primary students and 62.4 per cent for secondary students - in other words, one of the elements has been to increase for the neediest non-government schools the percentage of the cost of educating a child at a government school being paid to those needy schools. In the face of that, any claim by the Labor Party that our policy discriminates against the neediest schools is absolute nonsense. Over the next four years, total funding for Catholic schools will be $8.15 billion. This is an increase of something like 40 per cent over the last four years. It is therefore barely surprising that, on 23 August, a media release from the National Catholic Education Commission, which speaks for the generality of Catholic systemic schools throughout Australia, had this to say:The Senate should pass the State Grants Bill 2000 intact, the Deputy Chairperson of the National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC), Rev. Tom Doyle said today.Reverend Doyle said the commission:Supports the proposed State Grants legislation;Endorses the Commonwealth Government's application of the principle of need in making grants to Catholic systemically funded schools andAccepts the Commonwealth's decision in its determination of the present levels of funding to Australian schools.The media release continued:The Bill has the support of the NCEC and the State and Territory Catholic Education Commissions as it recognises that the allocation of funds is based upon need.When it comes to a determination of whether the government's policy is based on need or not, I would rather believe the Deputy Chairperson of the National Catholic Education Commission than the member for Dobell.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. As the Prime Minister has just outlined, the government's funding reforms for non-government schools deliver the greatest benefits to families on lower incomes at lower socioeconomic levels, and the vast bulk of the funding under the new arrangements goes to schools serving lower income families. The Labor Party continue to persist in misrepresenting the policy by selecting distorted figures to create a false impression about the impact of the policy. For example, they quote total figures of funding going to schools or increases without, as the Prime Minister said, looking at what the starting point was or what the total per capita funding is. For example, the King's School, being a former category 1 school, did not receive any funding increase for 15 years under Labor and is being funded at 31 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. -  - We will get to your hypocrisy in a moment, but just listen to the facts of the situation. The Thomas Hassall Anglican College is funded at 56 per cent of the cost of sending a child to a government school - in other words, at almost twice the level that a family sending a child to the King's School will get. Families sending children to the Tyndale Christian School will be receiving over 50 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school and, therefore, much higher per capita grants. That is why parents using the schools serving the neediest communities are much better off as a result of our policy. Still Labor say 30 per cent for a family sending a child to a government school, the King's School, is too much. Whatever we are giving in per capita terms to the schools that are category 1 schools is too much is what you are sayingthat you are going to reduce that amount.  - Labor are claiming that we are overfunding the schools serving the wealthiest communities. We can illustrate their absolute hypocrisy, because we are in a position to determine whose funding system provides more funding for schools serving the wealthiest communities. We are in a position to compare Labor's ERI system and the funding it delivers to schools serving the wealthiest communities with the SES funding system, the system we are introducing. We can do this very clearly because about half of the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities - that is, 32 - will have their funding maintained at the levels Labor paid those schools. We judged it to be fair not to go around reducing schools' funding levels - the funding levels that they have relied upon. So, essentially, half of these 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities are funded at Labor's levels and half are funded at our levels. What do Labor deliver to these schools? On average, Labor fund these schools at 29 per cent of the cost of sending a child to a government school. - The Leader of the Opposition insists on placing Labor in a position where they support a funding system which is rejected by every element of the non-government sector. Everyone who will be subject to the new funding system rejects Labor's funding system, and it does the Leader of the Opposition and Labor no good at all to keep insisting that the totally false, corrupt system that they use should be applied. The system that we are applying gives a fair measure of funding.Labor funds these schools serving wealthy communities on average at 29 per cent of the cost of sending a child to a government school. The government system funds its schools, under the new system, at a level of 20 per cent. In other words, Labor funds the schools serving the wealthiest communities at a level 50 per cent higher than under the government's funding system. The party that delivered higher per capita funding to schools in the wealthy communities was the Labor Party under its funding system. Let us just put that into per capita terms. Those funded under Labor's funding system, those schools serving wealthy communities, receive $3,031 per student per head whereas under the government system schools receive $2,025 per student in 2004. In other words, Labor provides 50 per cent more funding to the schools serving the wealthiest communities in Australia under its system than we provide under ours.So let us have an end to the utter hypocrisy and the selective statistics that the Labor Party put up. They have been completely caught out trying to play the divisive class warfare card by attacking a very select group of schools without in any way acknowledging that their funding system delivered more funding to schools serving wealthier communities than ours. There could be no clearer demonstration that the system the government is putting in place is a much fairer funding system than has existed in the past. That is why it has the support of the entire non-government sector.</DOC>

 - It appears that the member for Dobell is incapable of understanding a very, very simple explanation, because it is self-evident, from the answer that was given by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs - and this is an important issue - that it is not only the amount of the increase but also the current funding level that is important. I do not have in front of me the details of the funding level of Melbourne Grammar, the school to which the member for Dobell referred, but can I again remind the member for Dobell, in relation to the comparison he has sought to make between the King's School, the Thomas Hassall Anglican College and the Tyndale Christian School, that the Thomas Hassall Anglican College will, in the year 2004, receive $3,507 per primary student and $4,593 per secondary student. This is more than $2,000 per student higher than the funding that will be received by the King's School.What that means, of course, is that, even after these increases have been taken into account, under our policy we are funding children at schools like Thomas Hassall - which I use as an example of the sort of school for which we want to provide more opportunity and choice for parents to send their children to - at $2,000 a student more. The same point can be made in relation to the comparison with the Tyndale school, because those two schools were being funded under the present policy at a much higher level because their need is assessed as much greater. It is therefore quite misleading and incomplete, deliberately so, on the part of the opposition to say that the only thing that matters is a comparison of the increases. What matters is the ultimate outcome of the present funding plus the increase at the same point of time. If you do that, you find that under our policy students attending schools like the Thomas Hassall Anglican College and the Tyndale Christian School will get far more support from the government than students attending the King's School. You can spend the whole of question time talking about swimming pools and all these other envy symbols that the Labor Party seeks to drag into this debate, but nothing can alter the fact that we are, under our policy, giving far more support to the low fee independent schools than to schools like King's School. And no amount of deliberate distortion of the fact by the member for Dobell will alter that fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and interest in this area. I am aware, of course, of the Labor Party's recent announcement on the 30 per cent rebate, but other people could be forgiven for not being aware of it. It was announced on the same day that Cathy Freeman won the 400-metres gold medal. The Leader of the Opposition has given four doorstops since and has not mentioned it once. On radio 2GB last Friday, in spite of being given the opportunity to talk about health policy, he chose not to mention it. It has not appeared on the Labor Party's web site, and we have not had a press release on it.It is interesting to look at the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this because, by their own standards, the government has been criticised in the past by the shadow minister for health for secrecy in certain decisions. In a press release on 8 September 2000, we were accused of `secrecy' surrounding a Health Insurance Commission appointment, for the simple reason that we had not gazetted it and had not put out a press release. Well, of course, we do not need to gazette under the Health Insurance Commission Act, so that is incorrect as usual. So that means we are being secret when we do not put out a press release! Here we have the Labor Party with the biggest single spending decision they have made in the last two years in opposition too ashamed to talk about it, too ashamed to put out a press release about it and trying to hide it on the busiest news day in the last two years. I can understand why the Labor Party is embarrassed about this backflip, because it is not just the shadow minister for health but also members of the Labor backbench who have been talking about these issues. It was interesting that the member for Swan should interject earlier on this - on my best estimates, over 54 per cent of the adult population in his electorate is covered by private health insurance. He is on the public record as saying:There would be little doubt that in recent months this government has passed one of the most offensive pieces of legislation seen in this nation. I am referring to the so-called health reform package ...We will be reminding his constituents of his views on their 30 per cent rebate. The member for Sydney - and you can always trust the Left on these issues - with over 65 per cent of her electorate covered by private health insurance, has said that the government being prepared to spend $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money to increase private health insurance cover was `hardly money well spent.' But perhaps the best is the member for Paterson, with over 45 per cent of his electorate covered by private health insurance, saying:We are seeing one of the greatest bits of waste that this country has ever had presented to it by an irresponsible government.Such waste, such irresponsibility, that the Labor Party has picked it up lock, stock and barrel. The simple fact is that the shadow minister has been completely rolled on this. The Labor Party has no credibility. They did not want it, they did not invent it, they did not support it and they will get rid of it if they ever get the chance.</DOC>

 - I am not personally aware of the facilities at all of these different schools. My capacity to find out about those comparative facilities would be no greater or no less than the capacity of quite a number of people who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked me about need. The bottom line about the approach of this government to need is to be found in the end result of the application of the policy, and the end result is that schools like the King's School -  - get far less funding under our policy than do the more needy schools in the community. It is as simple as that. You can try to generate envy about basketball arenas; you can try to generate envy about swimming pools; you can play that silly old Labor game, but at the end of the day you are, on this issue -  - Just as the Labor Party was behind the eight ball in the early 1960s, when the Menzies government provided a historic breakthrough that delivered justice to the Catholics of Australia by state aid, in the early 21st century you are once again behind the eight ball in relation to the provision of choice in education. A growing number of Australians want more choice. Your envy games are not impressive to them, and your envy games will not prevent this government delivering choice to not only the better off people in the Australian community but also working-class families. You did not know that in the early 1960s and now, 40 years on, you still do not understand the dynamic of this debate. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I know she is genuinely interested in this issue and it is very important that all members of the House take a genuine interest in trying to improve job opportunities for indigenous Australians. The government does work tirelessly right across the broad range of issues - the Minister for Health and Aged Care in the health area, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in his area and me in the employment area. In the employment area we have a new policy, which we unveiled last year. We have put more resources into that policy and introduced some innovative programs. I must say we are pleased to see the positive response to various elements of it. We have, I think, 35 CEOs of some of Australia's largest companies committed to doing more for indigenous employment and we have the Structured Training and Employment Program.The Voluntary Service Foundation is a new proposal from the government trying to link the desire of Australians in the broader community to help indigenous communities with their particular skills. We are hoping to see real progress being made in that area. We have also moved to widen the National Indigenous Cadetship Scheme. I say to any employer who would be prepared to do more: if you could provide a helping hand to a young person in a university, give them a holiday job but also say to them, `If you are good at the holiday job, we will find you a job in our company at the end of your studies.' That to me is real encouragement for young people to find themselves meaningful employment.There is no question that we have a very significant problem. I was in Arnhem Land only in the last week or so and I pay tribute to Yirrkala Business Enterprises, who have worked very hard to improve opportunities. They work as subcontractors to Nabalco and a lot of jobs are provided. We are keen to build on the good work that has been done and to see more done in the future. I was pleased that there was a positive response to the discussions I had there. I must say, however, that when you hear in some places only 20 per cent of the kids are attending school it just reinforces the point that we still have a lot more to do to improve job opportunities. I am pleased to announce to the House today that the government have approved eight projects worth over $800,000 to provide jobs under STEP - the Structured Training and Employment Program - for indigenous people throughout the country, with projects from Penrith Lakes in Sydney and Ti Tree in the Northern Territory to Brisbane in Queensland. I think we have had bipartisan support on aspects of this policy; I appreciate that. I must say, however, that I was concerned that the new shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs in some of the first public comments that he made on this issue, rather than dealing with the substance of the issues, decided to play the man. He has been attacking the credibility of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation. The minister for reconciliation, both in government and in opposition, has been more committed to this issue than many other people in the House. When you go to Arnhem Land and see the extent of disadvantage and when you are confronted by the enormity of the task which we, as a parliament, still have before us to improve the employment opportunities of Aboriginal people, I must say it is disappointing that, rather than adopting a constructive approach, the opposition just revert to playing a game based on personalities and put the substantial issues to one side.This is a hard enough challenge for all of us without people attacking on a personal basis a person whose reputation stands very high in this parliament - on both sides of the parliament, I might say. It is a bit rich when a member of the frontbench on the other side says privately that none of them want to take the Aboriginal affairs job because it is like the toilet cleaner's job on the Titanic, and that person still sits on the front bench. He is known to the Leader of the Opposition, who has his shadow minister out attacking somebody with a reputation like the minister for reconciliation. I say to the Leader of the Opposition genuinely: you should say to your shadow minister, `Why don't you stick to the substantial issues?' There is enough disadvantage in this country without the distractions and the nonsense of personal attacks. You ought to play the ball and stop playing the man.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Despite the Labor Party's suggestion that there is some interest in the position it is putting forward, it remains totally isolated from every representative group for the non-government sector. The Catholic Education Commission has made very clear that it wants the Labor Party to pass this legislation as soon as possible. Terry Chapman, the Executive Director of the New South Wales Association of Independent Schools, said: The new system is fairer, more transparent than the old. We welcome it as a vast improvement on the old system and as an important step along the road to equity in Australian school funding.A particularly interesting comment came from Phillip O'Carroll, the co-founder of the Fitzroy Community School in working class Fitzroy in Melbourne, who said:The new scheme widens access to lower income parents.He went on to say:The old funding system forces the disadvantaged together and maintains a class system.The principal of the Creek Street Christian College in Bendigo said:As a community we believe we have battled long enough under the existing inequitable funding method and firmly hold the view that the SES funding method is more transparent and fairer.Dr Peter Tannock, the Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, said:It will give them - Catholic schools and systems such as the one mentioned in the last question - real increases in resources and a secure, long-term funding base. It will also help many Catholic schools to cope with cost pressures which are pushing up fees to levels which make it very difficult for families on low and moderate incomes.The headmaster of Camberwell Grammar School said:The SES model will mean that the amount of government assistance provided to Camberwell Grammar will reflect the financial capacity of our parents to pay school fees. We shall, as a result, be more accessible to families whose economic circumstances would otherwise make it difficult for them to choose this school for their children.The government's new funding arrangements mean significant increases for needy schools in electorates across Australia. I will just mention the electorate of Brand, the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition. The Hope Christian College will benefit by another $175 a year, Living Waters Lutheran College by $495 a year, Maranatha Christian College by $880 a year, Rockingham Family School by $1,011 a year and Tranby College by $997 per year. - The Leader of the Opposition should answer the question that all these schools are now asking him: are you going to take that extra money away from them or are you going to support the new, fairer funding system that the government is putting in place?</DOC>

 - I do not have in front of me -  -  - Of course I don't! I do not have in front of me the article to which the Leader of the Opposition refers, but I say that, as far as the statements made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and his general stewardship of these particular responsibilities are concerned, he has my total respect and support, because the minister for education has presided over the introduction of a new policy for all the schools of Australia that has won very widespread support. I have to keep bringing the Leader of the Opposition back to the reality that those who speak for the independent system of Australia - both those who speak for the Catholic systemic system and those who speak for the generality of other independent schools - all applaud the approach that is being taken. In other words, people who know -   -  - When Father Doyle spoke he was not speaking for King's, he was not speaking for St Ignatius College, Riverview; he was speaking for the poor systemic Catholic schools of Australia. As their spokesman, he said to Labor, `You pass this bill.' He would not have said that if this bill unfairly treated the Catholic systemic schools of Australia, because that is his brief. Surely the Labor Party understands that the National Catholic Education Commission, chaired by Peter Tannock, is the body that speaks for the thousands of Catholic systemic schools in Australia. They applaud the funding policies of this government, just as 40 years ago they applauded the breakthrough by the Menzies government which ended the discrimination against the Catholic school system.Once again, Labor is out of touch with what the independent sector is saying, Labor is out of touch with aspirational Australia and Labor is wrong to base this on some kind of very short-sighted envy politics which I believe will be rejected by the great majority of Australians, including many traditional Labor voters, who want the option, which they have had in the past, of sending their children to independent schools. They want more incentive, they want more assistance, they want greater choice. We are giving it to them; you are not. You are out of touch; we are in tune with the aspirations of Australia.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I think all members of the House know that he has a great interest in Indonesia and also in East Timor. Indeed, the House may be interested to know that the member for Farrer's book on East Timor has sold over 5,000 copies so far. I believe copies are still available.  - They are uncharitable remarks, by the way, from the Leader of the Opposition. The government welcomes the news that Eurico Guterres, who is one of the most prominent and notorious of the militia leaders in East Timor, was arrested in Jakarta yesterday and apparently will be charged with weapons offences in the very near future. The Australian government has been particularly concerned about the activities of Mr Guterres, and I made public our concerns I think on 7 September. So in the whole context of the Indonesian government moving to disband the militias in west Timor, as they have committed themselves to doing, this is a promising development. There is no doubt, though, in terms of collecting weapons from the militias in west Timor there is a long way to go. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Indonesian authorities said on 1 October that they had collected a substantial number of automatic guns - some 85 - 17 grenades and about 1,000 homemade weapons. Other ministers in Indonesia gave different figures on 1 October, and the Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security, Bambang Yudhoyono, reported the seizure under the voluntary phase of 63 military style guns, 40 grenades and 1,103 home-made weapons, so those figures are not entirely consistent.I make the point that the Australian government, along with the rest of the international community, remains very concerned about the number of weapons that are available to militias in west Timor, and of course from our perspective the risk it puts our own peacekeepers and other personnel - and obviously other members of the international community - in East Timor to. Nevertheless I had a discussion with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Alwi Shihab, during the course of today. In the course of that discussion I congratulated him on Indonesia's decision to arrest Eurico Guterres but I also reiterated the view of the Australian government, and I am sure of the Australian community as a whole, that we do hope that this campaign to collect weapons from the militias will be successful and that it is important to Indonesia's international standing that it be successful. The voluntary phase of the collection of the weapons is now complete and the Indonesian authorities have extended, I think until around the middle of October, the sweep by TNI and the police, POLRI, through west Timor to try to collect weapons. It is important that this process is successful, and we urge the Indonesians, as I did Dr Shihab in my discussions with him today, to ensure that it is indeed successful. The honourable member also asked about instability and problems in other parts of Indonesia. I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, according to Indonesian statistics, since January 1999 around 2,500 people have died in the Malukus in communal violence, that something like 500,000 people have been injured and wounded in that violence and that 400,000 people have become displaced persons. So we remain in this country, as I know they are in other countries, very concerned about the situation in the Malukus. As a result, today the government has announced a commitment of a further $1 million of emergency relief to the Malukus which will be distributed through a French based non-government organisation called Action contre la Faim. We are very concerned, and I think it is appropriate that here in this country we should do everything we possibly can to provide assistance to these humanitarian crises in Indonesia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It saves me adding to an answer after question time. I do remember the comment in 1999, and it was accurate. I believe the Health Insurance Commission with regard to MRI undertook the most thorough investigation ever. With respect to the case in Western Australia, I did in fact check with the Health Insurance Commission and there has been contact between the Western Australian offices of the Health Insurance Commission and the WA health department, and also contact between the Health Insurance Commission here in Canberra and the WA Health Commissioner. We do not even have a final report. We have no capacity to investigate state public hospitals ourselves because we cannot match data between Commonwealth agencies and state agencies. So we simply cannot be expected to have an investigation until the WA government has completed its own investigation.  With regard to whether or not I should be personally involved, let me use Western Australia as an illustration. In 1992 the Commonwealth attempted to get states involved in looking at issues of cost shifting, particularly with respect to public hospitals. Victoria was enthusiastic to proceed. South Australia and New South Wales came on board. Western Australia pointedly refused to become involved with the Commonwealth in any investigation of cost shifting in public hospitals. Who was the Premier of Western Australia when Western Australia actively stopped the Commonwealth taking action that could have prevented this happening in the first place? The member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence, was Premier and Treasurer at the time. Further, the legislation under which this would happen was introduced in 1994. The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1994, introduced in June 1994, specifically precludes the Commonwealth minister in any way becoming involved. So who was health minister in June 1994 when legislation was passed, stopping the health minister becoming involved? The member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. So we have gross hypocrisy on the Labor Party's part. Your own frontbencher stopped the Commonwealth looking at Western Australia. Your own legislation when you were on the front bench stopped the Commonwealth becoming involved.  Around 8,000 to 10,000 allegations are made to the Health Insurance Commission each year. If you take even the small investigations, there are up to 1,000 a year. In the last term of the Labor government, you could expect 25,000 to 30,000 allegations and 2,000 to 3,000 investigations. On how many occasions between 1993 and 1996 did the Labor Party health minister, either Graham Richardson or the member for Fremantle, become involved? Not one. Complete hypocrisy! Caught out - you do not understand the area.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Probably the best example of this is the Regional Health Services Program, which has been funded over the last two budgets under the Howard government. We have put aside $110 million for implementing this new program over the next four years, and we hope it will benefit around 120 communities. This is a major investment in the future health and wellbeing of people in rural and regional Australia. Already 40 communities have been identified for action under the program, and we have received expressions of interest from another 100 communities. This program is about working with local communities, particularly small rural communities, to try to discover what they actually need by way of primary health care and to develop and fund their needs. Importantly, this funding is for the long term. While we do fund things on a four-yearly basis, this is a long-term program and the funding that each of these communities gets is ongoing funding. In the planning process stage we have communities such as Woorabinda in the member for Maranoa's electorate and the Eyre Peninsula in the member for Grey's electorate that are going through this first stage of planning their long-term needs. It is basically about asking the local community what they need and working with them to achieve that end, but that is a difficult approach that takes some time. And often communities have some difficulty finding the time or expertise to develop their proposals, which is where local members become important and the role of the local MP in this is therefore critical. The member for Wannon in asking this question can take some pride that Cobden and surrounding regions, which serve around 4,500 people, have recently benefited from $110,000 a year of funding, which Cobden have said they will use towards podiatry, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and a range of youth programs, particularly parenting programs and student counselling. This is what the people of Cobden themselves need and what has been delivered. Another example is the member for Gippsland, the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who has told me that over the weekend he will be visiting communities in the Gippsland electorate specifically to discuss this program and how they might benefit. I propose to write to all MPs on both sides of the House in the near future to advise them on how they can work with their local communities to access this funding, which is a great innovation for small rural communities. </DOC>

 - Unlike the shadow minister, I will actually wait until I have all the facts; that means waiting until the Western Australian department's report is complete, which is utterly proper. I would put to her: between 1990 and 1993, when she was an adviser to the then minister for health, how many times did he become involved in investigations of the Health Insurance Commission? I think she will find not once. The fact is that the Commonwealth on many occasions over the last 10 years has found this sort of irregularity. We have recovered moneys in the past. This is nothing unusual. This is a beat-up by the Labor Party who are being hypocritical in the extreme when I am constrained by their own legislation and when the situation could have been prevented if the then WA Premier, Carmen Lawrence, had cooperated with the Commonwealth in 1992. </DOC>

 - This morning I joined the Prime Minister, the member for Richmond and the member for Farrer, who is the Mayor of the Paralympic Village, at a delightful ceremony with the Ngunnawal people who lit the flame in a very Australian manner. They lit a wonderful cauldron just on sunrise, and the Prime Minister transferred the flame to the first torchbearer, who was none other than David Hall, the APC Athlete of the Year and quite a tennis ace. Following that delightful ceremony and after the various dignitaries had spoken, I then went out to the Australian Institute of Sport, where Hamish McDonald, one of the AIS scholarship holders, was a torchbearer into the institute. The institute has been supporting scholarships for athletes with disabilities since 1989 and is quite the leading edge centre for training athletes with a disability.The federal government has done far more than this in terms of supporting our athletes. There has been $35 million to underwrite the actual staging of the event, as well as $6.5 million in team preparation. It is going to be one of the best prepared teams that we have ever sent to a Paralympic Games. In addition to that, we provided $1 million for the entry fees, registrations and uniforms of Australian team members. All the way along our Pollie Pedal route this year from Canberra to Sydney, which the members for Warringah, Parramatta, Werriwa and Cunningham were involved in, we had a wonderfully warm reception from the various schools, community groups and councils. We normally raise about $20,000 from our Pollie Pedal, but on that occasion the community came forward and raised $60,000. That was a spontaneous reaction to the Paralympics.I know our Paralympians have the best wishes of all of our community. We saw Louise Sauvage in the demonstration event at the Olympics just last week win the 800-metre race. We certainly will be out in force to support all our Paralympians in the coming weeks. We wish all of our athletes the best and congratulate the volunteers who again will be coming out in force to support the Paralympics, as well as the 1.4 million Australian volunteers who every weekend get out there with our kids on the various sporting tracks and fields right around Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Could I take the last part of his question first and say to the Leader of the Opposition that a straight dollar comparison between amounts paid by the federal government to independent schools and amounts paid by the federal government to government schools is fundamentally dishonest. As he well knows, as a former education minister, historically the great bulk of the funding of government schools has been borne by state governments and the great bulk of the funding of independent schools has been borne by the federal government. I think, roughly speaking, of the total amount paid by all governments to government schools around Australia, 88 per cent of the cost of that funding comes from state governments - which in turn get about 42 per cent of that money or thereabouts from the federal government through financial assistance grants - and only 12 per cent of the cost of that funding comes from the federal government. Therefore, if you make any straight dollar comparison between increases going to independent schools from the federal government with increases going to government schools from the federal government, the amount going to independent schools will always, in dollar terms, be much higher. The Leader of the Opposition ought to know that because that is the system that obtained in the whole 13 years the Hawke-Keating government was in office and, historically, that has been the arrangement. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, for many years - until the early 1960s, when the change came under the Menzies government - no assistance was given by governments to independent schools in this country. So those dollar comparisons are intellectually dishonest, and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dobell know that.The other part of the question referred to millionaires living in low income areas. The basis of that assertion is this notion that all independent school parents are millionaires. That is, intellectually and in practice, fundamentally dishonest as well. This government is interested in providing Australian parents with choice. The Leader of the Opposition mentions the King's School, which has been a convenient example for the opposition to light upon. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that every reputable spokesman from all of the non-government school bodies in Australia has said that the old EOAR system adopted by the Hawke-Labor government in 1985 was becoming increasingly inequitable and that the new SES system, which reflects far better the fee paying capacity of parents sending their children to independent schools, is a much fairer measure. An intellectually dishonest comparison with direct funding of government schools, when the federal government provides only 12 per cent of that funding, reveals the absolutely facile approach of the Labor Party on this issue.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. It is particularly relevant that he should ask that question today as Townsville is to host the Solomon Islands peace talks, which we hope will begin with a dinner tonight and continue during this week. I acknowledge the enthusiasm of the people of Townsville and the member for Herbert, as their federal representative, in encouraging the talks to take place in their fair city. As I speak, Australian and New Zealand C130s are embarking Solomon Islands delegates for this round of talks. The government regards these talks as a very important opportunity for all the parties from the Solomon Islands to get together to develop a solution to the ethnic tensions that have caused so much harm to their country in recent times. From the signing of the cease-fire on board HMAS Tobruk on 3 August there has been a very major effort by many parties in the Solomon Islands and by Australia and New Zealand to get the peace process going. That cease-fire has, one would say, roughly held, but there has been a continuation of conflict and disorder, and that is doing enormous damage to the Solomon Islands.This evening I will be flying to Townsville to meet with the parties. I will be encouraging all of the participants in this week's peace talks to take bold steps to end this conflict as quickly as possible. These talks mark only the most recent stage in the very substantial support for the Solomon Islands peace efforts that the Australian government has been providing. Our ships have provided a venue for preparatory discussions for the Townsville meeting, assisted by a New Zealand ship as well. We provided very substantial support for the Solomon Islands Cease-fire Monitoring Committee to help with the implementation of the cease-fire. We are also providing support for the newly established Solomon Islands Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace and for Solomon Islands non-government organisations that are working for peace. These talks have a particular importance. If peace is not brought to the Solomon Islands quickly, the country faces economic and social disintegration. We will do all we sensibly can to support peace efforts, but, ultimately, the success of the Townsville talks and the future of the Solomon Islands itself must lie in the hands of its own people. I know I speak on behalf of all members of the House when I say that we wish the Solomon Islands delegates well for the talks ahead.  </DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that it is not. One of the many distortions peddled by the Labor Party on this issue is the claim that the enrolment benchmark adjustment takes money from government schools and gives it to independent schools. It does not take money from government schools and give it to independent schools. The reality is that as children transfer and parents exercise a choice which is increasingly available under our policies - and if the Labor Party wants to analyse the enrolment figures of independent schools, it will find this - the growth sector has not been in what the Labor Party chooses to categorise as the wealthy schools. - The Leader of the Opposition always interrupts when there is a relevant point being made in relation to a question asked by one of his colleagues. The growth sector in independent schools - and not the so-called wealthy schools referred to pejoratively by the member for Dobell - has been in the low fee structure independent schools. As parents exercise their choice to take their children from government schools to independent schools, the cost burden on state governments is thereby reduced. I would remind the House that 88 per cent of the total cost of running government schools is borne by state governments while only 12 per cent is borne by the federal government. It stands to reason that, if there are fewer students in the government schools, the cost of running those schools is markedly lower. The enrolment benchmark adjustment only makes an adjustment in relation to half of the notional cost saving, and the argument that it goes into independent schools is completely false. The member for Dobell asked me why it was that certain funding for particular schools had been increased. The reason is that, under the new fairer system, it was found that under the funding levels given the socioeconomic measurement according to census data of the parents sending their children to those schools, those schools were entitled to additional funding. The old system had failed. The old system was judged by every spokesman for independent schools to be an unfair, inequitable system and, in those circumstances, the government changed it. No amount of dishonest comparison of figures by the Labor Party can alter that fundamental fact.  We are providing significant increases for government schools. We are providing very significant increases for the low fee independent schools. When you take into account the existing level of funding being received by the low fee schools, it can be seen that in the long run the real winners out of this new policy are Australian parents who want to exercise choice. The Labor Party is interested in an ideological battle; we are interested in giving working-class parents choice. That is why this system is increasingly winning support within the Australian community, because we give working-class families choice while the Labor Party wants to take it away from them. </DOC>

 - I would like firstly to refer to the latter part of the honourable member for Sturt's question in respect of the impact on the government's policy. The government's position on the full sale of Telstra at an appropriate time is unchanged. We have been open, upfront and consistent with the Australian people on this issue. In fact, the government have a clear policy. It is now clear that the opposition, the Labor Party, has secret plans. I am aware of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday denying statements made by one of Australia's leading investment houses, Macquarie Bank, that senior members - that is `senior members' plural - of the opposition have indicated that Labor is considering the break-up and the sell-off of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition defended his spokesman on finance by claiming that he was verballed. It was fairly clear to me, listening to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, that it was Macquarie Bank that was being verballed.But we have heard nothing from the spokesman on finance, the member for Melbourne. This is the man who was willing to write about Telstra in his book, Open Australia, the man who was willing to talk to Macquarie Bank about the breaking up and selling off of Telstra, the man who is responsible for Labor's policy on privatisation. But all of a sudden he is saying nothing. We know that he visited the Macquarie Bank; but what other investment houses has he visited and discussed this issue with? The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition's public stance on Telstra is untenable. The Leader of the Opposition knows this. The member for Melbourne knows this. The entire frontbench of the Labor Party know this. The Leader of the Opposition continues to state his public opposition to the further sale of Telstra -  - What the Leader of the Opposition should explain to the House is whether or not he authorised the member for Melbourne or the member for Perth to go and visit Macquarie Bank. What this demonstrates is the inability of the Leader of the Opposition to control his frontbench. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition demonstrated some leadership, because the member for Melbourne cannot remain on the front bench when he does not support his leader's publicly stated position on Telstra. This is a test of leadership. He should demonstrate his leadership by removing the member for Melbourne from the front bench. The Leader of the Opposition has no choice. He either backs the member for Melbourne or sacks him. </DOC>

 - I will check the claims that have been made by the member for Dobell. I never accept them at face value. I do not know why, but I suppose it is a natural caution that has been bred into me that I never accept them automatically. But I do know what is contained in this letter that is in front of me, and I can read from it. Perhaps it has been provoked by this debate, but it was written to the federal member for Adelaide and it is from the Greek Orthodox St George College. This is a school -  - Well, it has got to do with school funding, and I thought the question was about school funding. But, if it is not -  - The letter is written by Mr Basil Taliangis, the Chairman of the Board of Governors at St George College, which is a school under the auspices of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, Community and Parish of St George. It says:Dear Trish,As our Federal Member of Parliament I thought it appropriate to send you a short note to say how better off St George College is as a result of the proposed new SES funding arrangements. St George College, as you are aware is a low fee based school with many needs. The new funding, when it peaks in 2004, will be of great assistance and enable us to offer and manage expanding programs and curriculum.The question asked by the member for Dobell of course is of the same genre as a whole long list of questions that seek to establish that a funding formula based not on historic need -   - The new system more accurately measures the capacity of parents and therefore the long-term viability of schools. It is a fairer, more equitable system. It replaced a system that worked very, very unfairly, particularly in relation to many independent schools in rural and regional areas of Australia that were lumbered with a funding formula that assumed a position of wealth and affluence that had years ago vanished. That is why the new funding system in the long run is going to work to provide a much fairer distribution. The attempt by the Labor Party to generate the politics of envy will be seen by the Australian people for what it is. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I can tell him that, largely as a result of the sale of the first and second tranches of Telstra, Australia has become one of the largest share owning democracies in the world. The first tranche added 560,000 new investors into the share market and the second tranche added 320,000 first-time investors. A number of members of the Australian Labor Party took up the offer to become shareholders, and we congratulate them for doing so. I am asked about any alternative policies in relation to Telstra. Of course there are now alternative policies that are being put forward not only by the Australian Democrats but also by members of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. You can imagine my surprise when I saw the Leader of the Opposition interviewed on Sunday, defending the situation of 49 per cent private ownership and 51 per cent government ownership in Telstra by saying, `The position Telstra is in now is the position of virtually every European telco.' I wondered what telcos he had in mind that had 49 per cent private and majority government ownership - certainly not the United Kingdom, which has a privatised telco; not the Netherlands, which has majority privatisation; not Denmark, which has majority privatisation; not Spain; not Portugal; not Hungary; not Ireland; not Italy; not Lithuania. Of course Germany is privatising its telecommunications. The only European economies that I could find that had minority private ownership and majority government ownership were the former communist states: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Serbia and Montenegro - apparently they are the European telcos that the Australian Labor Party wants to model itself on. I was also quite amazed when, after a long diatribe on how Australia should become a new economy, the Leader of the Opposition declared that part of being a new economy would somehow be a nationalised telephone company, which raised a few eyebrows amongst the interviewers. But of course there are some thinkers in the Australian Labor Party who are prepared to put forward views on the privatisation of Telstra. We know about the member for Melbourne, who has a view that the network should be separated and the business floated  - a view which he put in his book. But we also know that he was not alone when he went to MacquarieBank. He would have you believe he did not go to Macquarie Bank to discuss Telstra; no, he just went to Macquarie Bank to discuss his book. You can imagine Macquarie Bank saying to him, `Please come in and discuss your book. We are avid readers of the works of the member for Melbourne.' But also there with him, whom we have not heard from yet, was Mr Smith. He was also apparently doing the rounds of the banks. We read in the Canberra Times: `A spokesman for Mr Smith said yesterday that nothing Mr Smith said to the bank would have suggested he wanted to split up Telstra.' But he was certainly at the bank. What a great surprise! `We don't go to merchant banks to discuss privatisation; oh, no, we just go to discuss our books.' We have not yet heard an explanation as to why Mr Smith and the member for Melbourne were at Macquarie Bank. They just decided there was a good lunch on that day or they liked the wine, I suppose. But we now have the member for Melbourne and the member for Perth - wasn't this lucky: the spokesman on privatisation and the spokesman on communications! But another part of the jigsaw came into being when the Australian Financial Review on Friday reported:Senior Labor figures last night rejected suggestions the Opposition was actively considering such a strategy - that is, privatisation - Despite this, senior ALP figures have privately admitted Telstra's ownership structure, with the Government owning 50.1 per cent, is untenable.  I wondered to myself: what senior figures would go off the record to discuss Telstra? My mind went back to that favourite cutting of mine that I always keep very close to my chest: `Simply Simon'.  - I will, Mr Speaker. I just draw your attention to the fact that the Australian Financial Review reported on Friday that senior ALP figures have privately admitted Telstra's ownership structure is untenable. That was written -  - That is on the record. That was written by Steve Lewis and Christine Lacy. There was another article in the Financial Review by Steve Lewis and Tony Walker entitled `Simply Simon'. It said:... grappling with contradictory elements of Labor policy such as those relating to the sale of Telstra and GST - And listen to this:He goes off the record quite often to express a personal view ... -  - I just want to put the facts before the House. The shadow finance minister goes to Macquarie Bank to discuss his book, the shadow communications minister goes to Macquarie Bank for a good lunch, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes off the record to discuss Telstra, and senior figures of the ALP admit that the government owning 50.1 per cent of Telstra is untenable. I also table a Bulletin article of 18 April 2000; I will read the relevant part. It has a picture of the shadow minister for communications and Mr Swan under the heading of `The new adventures of the Bobbsey twins'. It says:While Smith sounds strong in his opposition to the further sale of Telstra, some of his colleagues believe he would be prepared to sell it in office.And how right they are. The Leader of the Opposition may have what he believes to be a policy; it is not a policy which is shared by his economics spokesmen. They are doing the rounds of banks, they are actively discussing -   - I am sorry, but it is the truth to say that they are doing the rounds of banks. - As I said, they are doing the rounds of banks, and they are actively discussing Telstra, and that ought to be made plain to the backbench of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I will check the figures, but -  -  - No. I will check the figures, but I will hazard the explanation: one of the reasons is that the existing funding provision for the St George College is on a per capita basis higher than that of the other school. I hazard that that is probably the explanation. If St George College is in fact a school that has been started fairly recently and is a low fee school, its per capita funding already is probably much higher than that of the other school referred to in the question asked by the honourable member. It stands to reason therefore that that would be the situation. I do not know that the exhilaration and the excitement evinced on the other side of the House on this question is justified.I say to the member for Dobell that under the present arrangement, which is essentially a product of the application of policies pursued over quite a long period of time, the per capita funding of what are generally accepted as the poorer non-government schools is much higher in percentage terms than that of the others. It stands to reason that, if when you introduce a new system you make direct dollar comparisons, those comparisons can be quite misleading and quite dishonest, just as they are in relation to direct dollar comparisons between government schools and non-government schools.In the end, we have introduced a system that more accurately measures parental capacity than did the old system. If you want to get a true yardstick of whether that is a correct statement, you do not selectively quote dollar increases without acknowledging the base to which those increases have been added. If you include the base, you will find that the relative outcomes are fair and equitable and not as suggested by the member for Dobell.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He well knows how his rural constituency and so many others have benefited in very tangible and concrete terms from the part privatisation of Telstra. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in upgrading telecommunications infrastructure, whether it be with regard to mobile telephone services or television reception, and there is much more to come. It is the same with the Natural Heritage Trust: we have seen the restoration and refurbishment of the environment in quite unprecedented ways. And they are both programs which the Labor Party totally oppose. But they are not so opposed to the full sale of Telstra, are they, Mr Speaker, because we know that it is not just a solo effort by the shadow minister for finance in his discussions with Macquarie Bank. We know that several other frontbenchers as well as their state counterparts have signalled their intentions on coming to government for the full sale of Telstra.  With regard to state governments, Labor's Carl Scully, the New South Wales Minister for Transport, told us a short while ago to hurry up and sell Telstra and distribute the funds. On 17 March on ABC radio, when at Coffs Harbour, he said:Hand over three hundred million to the people of Coffs Harbour for that Telstra sale and we'll build a western bypass.Tasmania's Labor Premier Jim Bacon refers to the sale of Telstra as a `once in a lifetime opportunity' to deliver infrastructure and telecommunications funding. So what about the federal Labor Party? The most fascinating thing about the Leader of the Opposition is that he does have form on this issue. On 5 June 1994 he did a Meet the Press interview. Remember that he is the old champion of privatisation: from when in government he has a string of notches on his gun belt. He said:Privatisation in the limited sense would work. I mean, you could privatise Telecom if you set your mind to it.In other words, `If you had the ticker you would do it'; but he does not have the ticker or the resolve. The shadow minister for finance's book - that bestseller, I do not think - Open Australia in 1999 has been much quoted. But you have to put the whole quote in context to understand his resolve and determination to privatise Telstra:Part-private ownership of Telstra creates internal tensions and contradictions and inhibits the extent to which social value can be obtained from a huge investment of public capital. If the balance of Telstra is not sold, it may be desirable to restructure its core infrastructure functions into complete public ownership and fully privatise some of its service provision functions.So now we know on whom the Financial Review based its quote last Saturday when it said: Senior ALP figures have privately admitted Telstra's ownership structure, with the Government owning 50.1 percent, is untenable.That is exactly what Mr Tanner has been writing and saying for a good while. Senator George Campbell looms large in this debate with his influence on the Labor Left, although not so much in policy development. In the Financial Review in 1998 he said this:I have heard arguments - they have some merit - that we ought to consider breaking up Telstra into a number of separate identities servicing specific regions within Australia.So he is firmly in the camp of the shadow minister for finance. So it has been revealed that there are a number of Labor frontbenchers and a number of their state colleagues who are in support of Telstra; they are gradually being revealed to be so. Before long it will be a question of who on the front bench is not in support of Telstra privatisation. The final word should go to the member for Dickson. Who will ever forget those immortal words when, in the Melbourne Age of 22 February 1996, she said:I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra but I'm more worried about Labor in government.Are you still worried about Labor in government? No, you are not worried because you know they will sell Telstra in government.</DOC>

 - I notice a reference in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question to `Labor's plan'. That is really a triumph of hope and baloney over reality if ever I heard it, because if there is one thing we have not had from the Labor Party in the now more than 4½ years that they have been in opposition it is a credible alternative economic plan. The reality is that the Labor Party's economic policy is a litany of contradictions. The Labor Party's economic position will tell you that they will roll back the GST, although they are now very shy about giving us details. The Leader of the Opposition could give you a 10-year plan for something else that starts with R, but he cannot give you 10 details of the roll-back that the Labor Party will introduce when they come into government. Of course, every single so-called plan that the Labor Party produce on any issue has to be set against the background of what will be the cost of roll-back. Will roll-back cost half a billion dollars; will roll-back cost $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion or $5 billion? It still remains the policy of the Leader of the Opposition - he dare not mention the word, he dare not give any detail, but it is still the policy of the Labor Party - to roll back the GST. But I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: until such time as you detail how and when you will roll back the GST you have no credibility to talk about alternative economic programs. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. We have heard a lot from the opposition about fairness and equity in schools funding in recent days, but an examination of the record shows the utter hypocrisy of the claims that it is making. Labor's policy essentially was to keep fees at the best resourced private schools high and to stop new low fee schools coming into existence. Labor politically manipulated schools funding for 15 years. In pursuit of its high fee policy, 107 schools with 90,000 students received no real funding increase for 15 years; and a further 75 schools with over 50,000 students have not received any real funding increase since 1993. Students with disabilities were particularly disadvantaged by Labor's policy because, under its ERI policy, schools which Labor classified as the wealthiest received nearly $3,200 extra per secondary student with disabilities, while the neediest schools received nothing - not one extra dollar.The government's funding model redresses Labor's discrimination against the needier schools by providing funding for special needs students that Labor never provided. Under our policy we will be providing a flat per capita rate of $527 per special education student, while ensuring that no school loses out by maintaining such students at their current levels. This means, for example, that the Gawler River school in Bonython will be entitled to an extra $4,200 for special education, compared with zero under Labor; Kormilda College in the Northern Territory will be entitled to an extra $23,700, compared with zero under Labor; St Charbel's College in Blaxland, New South Wales, will be entitled to an extra $13,700 -  - compared with zero under Labor. The hypocrisy of Labor in this area knows no bounds. Our policies are designed to put a downward pressure on school fees. We want more families to have the kinds of educational choices which were exercised by Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and Simon Crean. Why shouldn't more families have the opportunity to choose the kinds of schools which the Labor leaders send their children to? Why is Labor's policy designed to keep pushing up the fees for these schools, making them less accessible to families, whereas our policy is designed do make schools - all schools - more accessible and to give low income families more choice than they have ever had before? Ours is a low fee policy; yours is a high fee policy. Stop this hypocrisy of taking advantage of the system for yourselves and not being prepared to give it to other families!</DOC>

 - I am not sure whether the question is about the knowledge nation or the so-called divide between the old and the new economy. But let me say to the honourable member that the point that I sought to make in the remarks to which she has made reference is that the measurement of whether an economy is in the current language `old' or `new' is, in my view, overwhelmingly determined by the capacity of an economy to use the benefits of technology, particularly information technology. On that basis, if you look at Internet usage, computer usage and productivity, ultimately you survive or perish in this world on your capacity, your productivity capacity -  - I am glad the Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects and nods his head, because our productivity capacity has shot up dramatically, under this government. - In fact, our productivity measurement over the last few years, as the Treasurer reminds me, has been higher even than that of the United States.  - One of the reasons - and I warm to my task through the interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - that over the last four years we have been able to increase the real incomes of Australian workers is that productivity has gone up. You had to resort to boasting about how you cut wages: you cut wages in your 13 years in government, and you boasted about it. You not only cut them but also boasted about how you would reduce wages. You could never bring about the productivity improvements that have been brought about under this government. So, if you look at the runs on the board as far as the performance of the economy is concerned, and the measurement of that according to productivity gains, this is in fact an economy that has been greatly aided by an intelligent usage of information technology.The other point I would make to the honourable member for Fremantle is that measuring the capacity of economies to use technology is really, in my opinion, to demolish this false dichotomy between the old and the new within an economy. Just because a nation has a large dependence on agricultural and mining exports - and I am very proud of the fact that this country has highly efficient farms and highly efficient mining industries -  - It is the application of information technology to produce which is important. When you look at the application of information technology -  - to the industries of this country, you find by our general economic performance that that is one of the reasons why we have outperformed just about every economy in the Western world over the last 4½ years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for the question. I know of her very considerable interest in the welcoming of bona fide tourists to Australia as visitors. We do have a system designed to facilitate the entry of genuine tourists while, at the same time, maintaining the integrity of our border arrangements and our immigration program. It is a balanced approach. It is one which saw a record number of visitor visas, as well as working holiday visas, being granted by Australian officers overseas, in the year 1999-2000. Visitor grants rose by 7.3 per cent compared with the previous year - and this at a time when integrity was maintained because the non-return rate over the same period from the previous year has reduced significantly. Just to give you an idea of what has been happening in important emerging markets in China and India, for instance, visitor visa grants increased by over 36 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. There are a number of tools that are used to identify areas of risk. We use objective measurement for that purpose where there is evidence of overstay. What that means is that further inquiries are made by our officers to ascertain whether or not a visit is genuine. We do maintain certain risk profiles. The risk profiles are not an invention of this government; they were introduced by the previous government. They were reviewed in 1995-96 by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, chaired by Senator McKiernan. In its report, that committee commented:... the Committee supports the principle of the risk factor profile ... While the visitor visa refusal rates from posts in certain risk factor countries are high, large numbers of visitor applicants at such posts are approved.It needs to be clearly understood that the risk factor list does not automatically exclude anybody from entry to Australia; it simply points to those people to whom further questions might be directed to ascertain that a genuine intention to visit is there.I am surprised at reports that suggest that some members in the Labor Party question the use of the risk profile. It has been reviewed. I notice that in one of the more colourful comments - perhaps designed to get publicity - an Olympian, Tatiana Grigorieva, was brought into question. Let me make it very clear: nobody's migration or entry to Australia is usually introduced, for privacy reasons, into debate. But I might say that anybody coming to participate in the recent Olympics was, even when risk factors might have been involved, judged to be a bona fide visitor.I might also say that under the risk profiles that existed under the former Labor government for the former Soviet Union, the Russian federation, it was not only females of 20-plus but also males of 20-plus who were included in the risk factors. If you go through many of the other categories to which the honourable member referred, you will find that the more recent data that is being used has been considerably refined, and numbers of groups that were, under the risk profiles, identified when you were in office are no longer identified. This system is a very important system for tourism in Australia. It ensures bona fide visits. It ought not to be brought into question by cheap comments designed to get publicity.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. - The first bit of ignorance betrayed in the question is that Australia is a substantial importer of paper. There is an aspect of simple arithmetic that says that if one party uses an Australian product then somebody else has to use an imported product. Why are we importing paper? Because a previous Labor government shut down Wesley Vale. I can assure you that we would not have to go looking for paper to print something on if Wesley Vale were producing paper today at the rate that it would have done. Furthermore, there is a very good chance that we would have people constructing new paper manufacturing facilities in Australia today if the Labor Party would pass a regional forest agreement piece of legislation that would give those investors the certainty of resource they need for that purpose. The whole fact of life is that various people are using millions of dollars - in fact, about $1,500 million - of imported paper every year. We do not instruct private enterprises as to which they use because we have not got enough Australian paper, and all the reasons for that situation are the result of the previous policies of the Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I am pleased to advise the House that the government has approved the Bendigo Stock Exchange to form and receive a licence under the Corporations Law. The Bendigo Stock Exchange proposes to operate a market tailored to meet the needs of smaller companies across a range of industries, in particular those industries servicing rural and regional Australia. What this does is help smaller businesses to raise the capital to develop new ideas and to promote them, particularly at a time when Australia is a very attractive export oriented nation. It is good news for regional Australia because it creates a link between metropolitan Australia and rural and regional Australia so that businesses setting up in rural and regional Australia have the opportunity to expand. This sort of initiative has been supported by the Commonwealth not only through the licensing procedures but also through the $400,000 we have spent through the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. My colleague Senator Nick Minchin has supported this proposal with a view to supporting rural and regional Australian businesses which are looking to raise additional money.We have created an environment of self-help for Australian businesses. We have helped to stimulate and build new exchanges, including this exchange and the Newcastle Stock Exchange, to create an environment where smaller businesses can go to list and raise the money to support new ventures. The backers behind BSX include the Bendigo Bank group - which I understand has set up two community banks in the member for Mallee's electorate at Minyip and Rupanyup - and Computershare and the Small Cap holdings group. This is another step forward in the government's determination to try to help businesses, particularly in rural and regional Australia, to raise the money to expand their businesses and to create more jobs for people right across Australia.</DOC>

 - The agency did conduct an audit of The Oaks on 19 and 20 September. Since that time, the agency, the department and the approved provider have taken all appropriate steps. Two sanctions have been placed on the approved provider. Our concern has always been for the wellbeing of the residents. I will add that the matter has been referred to the Commissioner for Complaints, and one of the issues that has been referred to him for him to look at is the responsiveness of doctors attending residents when they are asked to do so, both from the point of view of their willingness to attend and the speed with which the attendance occurs. I repeat that the government's concern and my concern is always for the wellbeing of residents. On this occasion the agency and the department have been in constant contact with the approved provider to ensure that outcome. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Medicare has been very good at treating acute illness, but it has not been as good at preventing illness or as good at managing chronic illness. Last Friday, I was able to join the member for Deakin in his electorate in launching five demonstration projects on sharing the care, aimed at helping people manage chronic illness. This is a very exciting initiative. Chronic illness is the single biggest burden of illness the country faces. Three million Australians live with a chronic illness. Illnesses such as diabetes, pain, arthritis, cardiovascular disease and cancer all cost the community about $1 billion a year each in direct and indirect costs and, with just what we already know works, we could probably save 25 per cent of the costs in any one of those illness categories. The hard thing, though, has been incorporating into our health care system something that manages the chronic illness to try and stop people needing medical care rather than to just give them the medical care when they are actually ill.We were surprised with the amount of interest and enthusiasm. We received nearly 130 very serious applications for just five projects and, because of this, will have a second round of funding later on. The five projects cover a whole range of areas in Australia, from metropolitan through rural to remote. There is one in the member for Grey's electorate, looking at particularly diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In Brisbane, the Arthritis Foundation is taking the lead with arthritis and diabetes. The Tasmanian University Department of Rural Health is looking at economically disadvantaged small rural communities where there is a high incidence of chronic illness. In Katherine West we are building on the coordinated care trial that has had extraordinarily good early results in improving indigenous health in that area to look at people over 35 years of age who have cardiovascular disease with diabetes or renal disease.In the electorate of Deakin, we are looking at the Whitehorse Division of General Practice having what they call a `good life club'. This involves taking older people, particularly people with an Asian background, and helping them manage cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression. It is a very innovative project. It is one we are funding in excess of half a million dollars. We are using existing structures for this good life club, where people will be assigned a coach to work with their local GPs and to help people best manage their diabetes, heart disease or depression. They will keep a diary, they will use that with their GP to give feedback; and we think this can very substantially improve the quality of life for these people and, at the same time, reduce health care costs in the long term. This is the way of the future in health care; managing chronic illness is the biggest single challenge we have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and I note that unemployment in his region has fallen from 13.6 per cent - when the dud Leader of the Opposition was the dud Minister for Employment, Education and Training - to just 5.4 per cent, thanks to the outstanding policies of the Howard government. The latest round of announcements means that nearly 100,000 Australians have had the opportunity to participate in Work for the Dole. Since 1 January, the government has announced nearly 2,000 new projects, with places for more than 30,000 job seekers. I have been asked about any new threats. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition promoted to his frontbench one of Work for the Dole's biggest critics: the member for Fremantle two years ago called Work for the Dole `insulting and destructive', last year she called it `cynical exploitation' and most recently she called it `coercive and repressive'.The member for Fremantle is at odds with the member for Batman, who encouraged community groups to get involved with Work for the Dole; she is at odds with the member for Dickson, who claims that Labor is in favour of Work for the Dole; and she is certainly at odds with her own electorate, where community groups have put in place 38 Work for the Dole projects, giving valuable work experience to nearly 1,000 job seekers, and where 80 per cent of teenagers think Work for the Dole is a good thing, according to a Sunday Times survey of Perth young people. It is high time that the member for Fremantle and other members opposite said something positive about the great program that they claim to support. Unemployment in Fremantle has come down from 14 per cent - when the Leader of the Opposition was the dud minister for employment - to seven per cent, and Work for the Dole is one of the reasons why the situation is improving.</DOC>

 - The honourable member in his question has got many of his facts entirely wrong. The fact of the matter is that the agency has planned very fully for the best use of their assessors to ensure that the time line of 31 December is met and that all accreditation processes will take place. I might point out that the opposition spokesman for aged care, Senator Evans, has said that he is in favour of accreditation and wants to give this excellent policy bipartisan support, yet we have a backbencher who is trying to undermine the success of the policy of raising standards -   - and ensuring that those providers which ought not to be in the business are not in the business. The fact of the matter is -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It was indeed the agency that carried out the audit which is relevant to the Oaks nursing home. It is the department and the agency together -  - that are monitoring the progress of what is occurring. Indeed the matter is -  - in hand and the government department and the agency have followed the proper processes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and his interest. Just before coming to the House this afternoon I launched World Mental Health Day. I was pleased to be joined by the member for Jagajaga and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, which gives some idea that this is an issue that is taken seriously across the parliament.The new symbol for Mental Health Week is the flannel flower, which many members on both sides of the House are wearing. This is something we hope will become associated with Mental Health Week, just as daffodils are with cancer research or the red nose is with sudden infant death syndrome. The flannel flower is an Australian native plant. It provides a very positive image for mental health. It is synonymous with the qualities of resilience and the ability to adapt which are very important qualities in dealing with mental illness. This year the theme for Mental Health Week is `health and work.' It aims to look at workplaces as places to promote mental wellbeing, to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and to help those people in the workplace with mental illness, with the hope that it might be treated just like any physical illness in the workplace.The member asked about programs for mental health generally. Australia has a proud record in this area. The US Surgeon General, David Satcher, who was out here last year, publicly recognised Australia as a leader in this area, as did the British health minister, Paul Boateng, who the year previously was out here to look at what we had done and to see what he could take back to implement in the UK. We have been driving this through two national mental health strategies, the second one providing $300 million to states and territories to restructure and reform mental health services on the ground. We have a very significant program looking at suicide prevention. We provide substantial resources for community access to crisis counselling, such as Lifeline, Kids Helpline and Reach Out! And we have the National Depression Initiative, which has strong support across the whole parliament. At one time or another 20 per cent of Australians can expect to suffer from depression that leads to clinical symptoms. The Depression Initiative is a very exciting project that is going at a very fast pace, as you would expect with the former Premier of Victoria leading it. All in all, as I said, we can be proud of what we are doing. Mental illness and people's attitudes to it are changing. In this area we have got every reason for hope and optimism.</DOC>

 - The new system is a fairer measure than the one that it replaced. The new system, for example, accommodates, in a way that the old system could never accommodate, for the fact that many independent schools in country areas of Australia have lived through the phenomenon of having had, 30 or 40 years ago, a far wealthier parent body than they now have, because of the changed circumstances in rural Australia. But, because of the historic funding formula that was entrenched in the ERI system adopted in 1985, those schools and those parents were unable to get additional assistance. In this whole debate, the difference between us and Labor is that we believe in choice. We do not believe that independent schools should be available only to a limited section of the Australian community. We believe people should be able to exercise the right of choice, and I totally reject the class driven claims of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley, who is chairman of the government members' committee on environment and heritage and has taken a long interest in environmental matters, for the question. I am proud to say to the House that this is the biggest attempt at a national level by any government of any persuasion to do something serious about the salinity problem in Australia. For the first time, we have a national plan which seeks to mobilise state and federal governments, local communities and all of those who are concerned to leave to future generations of Australians not only a water quality but also a soil quality which reverses the deterioration of the past 200 years. We are putting to the states a plan, to be considered at the COAG meeting on 3 November, that over a seven-year period will involve a commitment by the federal government and the state governments of $1.5 billion. It will identify the 20 most affected catchment areas around Australia. It will develop in relation to each of those catchment areas an action plan involving not only the state governments but also the federal government and local communities. For the first time, we will have a plan of action for all governments and communities in Australia to do something about what everyone has known for a long time represents one of the most serious environmental challenges, if not the most serious environmental challenge, that this country faces.We must all be concerned about the fact that one-third of Australian rivers are now in a poor condition; that dryland salinity currently affects 2.5 million hectares, which is five per cent of the cultivated land area of Australia; that, without remedial action of the type I outlined today, this could expand to 12 million hectares; that land and water degradation is estimated to cost up to $3.5 billion a year; and that, if we do not do something about it, in 20 years time the drinking water of the city of Adelaide will be unfit for human consumption on two out of five days. The only way that you can address that problem is to have a national action plan - something that this country has needed for years. I am proud that, building on what we did in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust and building on the other policy initiatives of my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, the coalition's environmental credentials have received another boost with the announcement that I have made today. I would ask the state governments of Australia to join us in tackling this very serious environmental problem. I hope that they will put political differences aside. I hope that I can count as much on the support of the New South Wales Labor Premier as I can on the support of the Western Australian Liberal Premier, because this is a national problem that transcends political differences. This is a national problem that should have been tackled years ago. This government has summoned the political courage, the economic commitment and the environmental zeal to tackle this problem, and I hope it is endorsed by the premiers because, if they do so, they will be making a practical contribution to the restoration of the environment of Australia in an area which represents a very serious threat to the long-term environmental health of our nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform the honourable member for Hinkler and all members of the House that the government's position with regard to the sale of Telstra is unchanged. The government has been open and up front with the Australian people, and the remaining shares in government hands will be disposed of at an appropriate time. I note that about an hour ago, at the Press Club, David Hale from Zurich Insurance was asked a question in respect of administration in Australia. He said that one of the things he would do is get bipartisan support for the sale of the rest of Telstra. He said that this is essential because the current ownership structure is depressing the share price, increasing the cost of Telstra, raising capital and limiting Telstra's ability to play a role in the region.The honest approach which the government takes contrasts starkly with that of the previous government. Labor's approach in government was to simply say they were not going to privatise something and then to flog it off. They did that not just once but twice when it came to the Commonwealth Bank, and they also took this approach when it came to Qantas.  With regard to the second part of the honourable member's question, the House will recall that yesterday after question time the shadow spokesman for privatisation, the member for Melbourne, gave a personal explanation. This personal explanation raised more questions than it answered about the spokesman for privatisation's position on Labor's secret plan to break up and to sell off Telstra. In the statement, the honourable member for Melbourne confirmed that he met with Macquarie Bank and he confirmed that the structural separation of Telstra was discussed. What he did not state was his support for Labor's public position that no portion of Telstra would be privatised, and he did not disclose what he said to Macquarie Bank on Telstra. I looked at his words closely in the Hansard, and he said:At no stage in this meeting or in any other forum have I ever expressed support for further privatisation of Telstra.In his explanation, he ignored the fact that in his book - and may I remind the House of his book entitled Open Australia - on page 179 he said the following:If the balance of Telstra is not sold, it may be desirable to restructure its core infrastructure functions into complete public ownership and fully privatise some of its service provision functions.He went on:Public money is more appropriately invested in the basic telecommunications network rather than the provision of particular niche services ...May I also remind the House of what the Leader of the Opposition said on 10 February 1999 in a doorstop. He was referring to the statements by the honourable member for Melbourne in his book. He said:The particular idea of Mr Tanner was to extract the net and to have a publicly owned net with the services provided privately around it. That's an idea. We would, in any roundup review, be looking at the whole range of ideas on that and other matters.I do not know what the honourable member for Melbourne considers a forum. Obviously, his ideas on a forum and mine differ somewhat. But I would have thought that his statements in print and clearly his discussions with the Leader of the Opposition on his idea to break up and sell off Telstra clearly constitutes a forum under any reasonable definition. The member for Melbourne continues to deceive and mislead. He has failed to clarify his position on Labor's secret plans to break up Telstra. He has refused to back Labor's public position that there would be no further privatisation of Telstra, that there would be no break up and sell-off of Telstra under a Labor government. He continues to defy the Leader of the Opposition. As I said yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition has two choices: he either backs him or sacks him.</DOC>

 - The driving force behind our policy is to give choice to parents. Therefore, you need a funding system that more accurately measures the financial circumstances of parents than the old funding system. The old funding system, particularly in relation to parents in non-metropolitan areas, was clearly unfair and unreasonable. That is the view of not only the government but also the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Association. Those who sit opposite seem incapable of getting into their heads the proposition that in the end it is the needs of parents that count more than some kind of rigid formula.The reality is that you can go to any independent school in Australia - particularly but not only some of the schools that have been mentioned by the Labor Party over the past few days - and you will find thousands of parents who have made massive financial sacrifices in order to send their children to independent schools. That is a sacrifice and a choice that we believe should be recognised on an equitable basis, and that is the basis of our funding approach. Just as we fully support the right of people who are well-off to send their children to government schools - that is their perfect right - we equally support the proposition that a funding formula that looks to the financial circumstances of parents rather than historic judgement about the wealth of schools is a far more equitable formula. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I can tell her that, no, the government has not altered its policy on privatisation. It intends to do precisely what it said to the electorate it would do before the election. In answer to the second part of the question, doing what you promised to the electorate at the time of the election when you were elected into government is a policy absolutely unprecedented. Certainly in fulfilling what we said to the Australian people before both the 1996 and the 1998 elections we are acting in an absolutely unprecedented way, because before this government came to office the Labor Party policy was always to promise one thing and do precisely the opposite. The Labor Party would always go out and deny that it had any privatisation plans until it launched a Pearl Harbor style attack on either a budget night or some subsequent occasion. Let me go through the evidence. On 17 September 1990, in relation to Qantas, the then transport minister, Kim Beazley - criticising the coalition, then in opposition - said:... the opposition would sell 100 per centcriticising us over Qantas - ... the position we are putting forward and which we are suggesting to conference, would sell around 49 per cent.May I ask the question: does Qantas still today have 49 per cent private ownership and government majority ownership? Who was it that privatised Qantas? It was the Labor Party; Mr Kim Beazley. The policy was then moved on in a higher plane to the Commonwealth Bank. Not only did the Labor Party promise that it would never privatise the Commonwealth Bank but in a letter dated 24 September 1993 to every investor in the Commonwealth Bank the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, wrote this, speaking of the Labor Party:The government has no intention whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding. The government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the bank's majority shareholder in the future.If a private promoter had put that out in a prospectus and then turned around and sold off all the shares, you would have the ASC down investigating and you would probably end up with some kind of conviction. And then we remember, notwithstanding that promise in 1993 - and I will table that promise - budget night of 1995. As it turned out, Mr Willis was then the Treasurer and the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance. Having promised to every investor that the government would never sell down the government majority in the Commonwealth Bank in that famous budget where he promised he would produce a surplus and came in $10,300 million short, the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, said in relation to achieving a surplus:This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue, and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the Government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank.The Labor Party backbench were not even told about that. They filtered in on budget night to hear the then Treasurer, in defiance of his earlier promise, announce the sale of the whole of the Commonwealth Bank. I say to the Labor Party backbench: it will happen again. You know it will happen again. You are not let into the secret until it is first cleared with the opposition. But I must say that there is one Labor Party member who fought this process all the way, who knew what was going on, who knew that the Labor tactic was always to say one thing on privatisation and do another -   - that is, the lady who now interjects - it was the member for Dickson. She knew all along you could not trust the Labor Party. She was fingering them time after time. - She said, `And they changed the policy.' Of course they changed the policy, and they will change it again. That is the whole point: they always change their policy. They changed their policy on Qantas, they changed their policy on the Commonwealth Bank and they will change their policy on Telstra. She was right previously. - She now interjects: `I do believe them - now.' And she did believe them then, she says. The member for Dickson did not believe them then. She said on 9 December 1996:The Labor government ... hoodwinked a great many people about what majority Commonwealth ownership means. ... Then history says that the government - contrary to all assurances - said, `We are going to sell the rest.' And it happened.Contrary to all assurances, they said, `We are going to sell the rest,' and they did. Contrary to all assurances, do not listen to what they say, Mr Speaker; watch what they do.</DOC>

 - The Australian Taxation Office has consistently taken the view in the past, and it still does, that abusive, employee share schemes - abusive, artificial, employee schemes - are contrary to part IVA of the tax act and associated legislation, because their dominant purpose is a tax benefit, and that they will be struck down under those provisions which were put in place to prevent abusive and artificial schemes. The Commissioner for Taxation has consistently advised the government that he intends to take all steps to enforce that, and we rely upon his advice. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition then alleges that there must have been something wrong with meeting the Remuneration Planning Corporation - I think that is the essence of what he says. -  - If there is nothing wrong with meeting the Remuneration Planning Corporation, why did you ask, `Did you have a meeting?' The heavy implication is that anybody who met with the Remuneration Planning Corporation, which presumably is in favour of employee share schemes, is doing something wrong or should not be taking advice from them - a heinous thing to take advice from the -  - He interjects: `Did you take advice from them?' - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked if I took advice from the Remuneration Planning Corporation, the assumption being that one should not take advice from the Remuneration Planning Corporation. I want to table a document here on that point, which is called `Handle with Care'. There is one member of the opposition frontbench who will know the name. It was a publication of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which the Australian Council of Trade Unions produced to promote employee share schemes. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions who presided over this report `Handle with Care' was Mr Martin Ferguson. I want to read out the acknowledgment and thanks from the ACTU at the beginning of `Handle with Care': This publication was produced with the assistance of the Australian Employee Share Ownership Association, in particular, Mr Geoff Price, the principal from the Remuneration Planning Corporation, who prepared the initial draft and provided ongoing advice.I get asked questions about whether I took advice from the Remuneration Planning Corporation - when the ACTU had it writing its reports! One ACTU president badly letting down another. I table the document.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. There is no doubt that the partial sale of Telstra has delivered enormous benefits to the Australian community and created tens of thousands of jobs. About $990 million has been released into the community from the two tranches of the sale of Telstra to support a very wide range of projects. Some $250 million has gone into the Networking the Nation project which provides world-class telecommunications infrastructure for regional and rural Australians. We have seen $150 million allocated for untimed local calls in extended zones, which will allow even more young Australians to access the Internet without the burden of STD telephone rates, and we have seen $158 million go to the Building on IT Strengths program, including $78 million for incubators for young Australians to get their great information, technology and communications ideas to market. In September I announced in Tasmania a project worth $9.4 million to support skills development in the ecotourism and IT industries. This is going to help provide jobs to some 1,800 Tasmanians over the next four years.Just to show the great benefits of the partial privatisation of Telstra, I also draw attention to the fact that in Tasmania last week another project of great importance was launched by Senator Gibson and the Tasmanian Minister for Education, called Connecting Tasmanian Schools. This initiative is going to establish area networks linking government schools as well as provide additional computers and support equipment for both government and non-government schools in Tasmania. No wonder the Tasmanian Labor Premier, Mr Bacon, has called the privatisation of Telstra `a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity', because all these projects represent a very substantial investment in building communities and building opportunities in Australia. The Labor Party of course, which voted against and opposed all these initiatives, are showing that they are a party not committed to the kinds of community developments which this government believes in and which the partial privatisation of Telstra so far has permitted. The only question in everybody's mind is: can you believe Labor on this; will they do the same in office as they have done in opposition? We know the answer to that question. They say they will not, but they will.</DOC>

 - Can I say first of all that with this, as with so many of the questions that are asked, the Labor Party make a false assertion on the old ACTU theory that if you make a false assertion long enough somebody will believe it. Government members who contributed to a report released yesterday on employee share ownership advocated no such thing as legalising bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It is a totally false allegation and, frankly, you ought to know better. As I said earlier, I must say I am totally bewildered by the Australian Labor Party's position. On the one hand they go to their conference and say they want to promote employee share ownership, and then on the other hand they come in here and engage in useless, childish ploys - like those engaged in by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who asks, `Did you take advice from the Remuneration Planning Corporation' -   - when one of his frontbenchers was having reports written by the Remuneration Planning Corporation. - We then had this question about legalising bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were artificial schemes - if I can go back through a bit of tax history - and the view was taken at that time that no sooner had you taken one such scheme to court than somebody would amend it in some particular way and make it legal. So the government at that particular time decided to change the tax law and introduced general anti-avoidance provisions. I believe it was the then Treasurer who did that. The general anti-avoidance provisions say that it does not matter whether you engineer things from this kind of structure to that kind of structure - if your dominant purpose is to get a tax break of some kind or another, the scheme can be struck down and tax can be assessed on the basis of what would be the transaction otherwise. Those provisions were inserted into the law so that such schemes could be attacked under general anti-avoidance provisions.The commissioner's advice, as I said before, in relation to abusive employee schemes - not all schemes, but abusive employee schemes where the dominant purpose is a tax benefit - is that they will be found contrary to the law. That is the way in which he proposes to attack them. Those are the steps that he takes. That is why the provision is actually in the law. I know that the Labor Party has a lot of trouble with tax policy. The Labor Party has sat in opposition in this parliament now for five years; what was its big tax policy? The `r word' - a word which it cannot now even pronounce. Let's say it for them: `roll-back'. In order to try to disguise the absolute lack of policy, they run around making false accusations.I want to finish on this point. As far as this side of parliament is concerned, we actually want to encourage share ownership. We believe that employees should be able to own shares. We do not think you should lock employees up and have union bosses tell them what to join and how to think. We think you should give them a go in the company. We are pleased that Australia now has the highest per capita share ownership in the world. The only thing I can say to the Labor Party is that, if they want to encourage it further, they should get on with their policy to privatise Telstra.</DOC>

 - Members of the House will be aware that, in a recent survey done by the OECD, Australia was found to be one of the six economies in the developed world that had so lifted its productivity and its performance that it was described as a `new economy'. The test of whether an economy is a new economy is whether it is able to so lift its productivity that it grows its economy faster with low inflation. On any basis, Australia has performed well on that test; in fact, in terms of multi-factor productivity Australia has outranked the United States over this decade, particularly over the last four years of this decade. This was a point made by the Economist on 23 September.  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `David Hale'. - As I recall, he said that the best thing Australia could do -  - was privatise Telstra. Some mothers do have 'em, don't they? The Labor Party sits there and says, `David Hale', who gets up at the Press Club today and says, `The best thing that Australia could do would be to privatise Telstra.' This is a government which has cut capital gains tax in half - something the Labor Party never did; has made US pension funds able to invest in venture capital without paying capital gains tax - something the Labor Party never did; cut company tax - something the Labor Party never did; cut income tax -  - The 1995 budget, which I read out earlier, increased the company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. That was the last Labor Party budget. - You took it down and brought it back up again! Some mothers do have 'em. Really: `What about the one that brought it down'! - The Labor Party said it was going to cut company tax, but got re-elected in 1993 and increased company tax so that when this government came to office it was 36 per cent. It had previously been 33 per cent. This government has put in place cuts to company tax - from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. We cut company tax and, in relation to US pension funds, we cut capital gains tax - never been done before; the Labor Party never cut capital gains tax. We make it so that US pension funds can invest capital gains tax free in venture capital - never done by the Labor Party. We cut company tax and we cut income taxes - and we are fought every step of the way on income taxes. We fight for a privatised telecommunications carrier and we are fought every step of the way, and then the Labor Party says at the end of all that, `We are in favour of a new economy.' You have opposed all of the tax reductions and privatisation programs which could take us there. The Economist says:The popular distinction between the old and the new economy completely misses the point. The most important aspect of the new economy is not the shift to high-tech industries, but the way that IT will improve the efficiency of all parts of the economy, especially old-economy firms....				...				...... historically, the biggest economic gains from a new technology have come not from its invention and production, but from its exploitation.This is all about creating an open economy which can adapt IT to make old economy firms more productive, which can build new economy industries with lower capital gains taxes and lower company taxes, and which can harness productivity which will come out of labour market reforms and out of privatisation. The OECD finding was that Australia has had success amongst the six top economies of the world over the last 10 years. That is not to say that we can now stop. It is important that we continue, that we take every step we can to enhance productivity in this country, that we run a good fiscal policy, that we run a good privatisation policy, that we run a good tax policy, and that we ensure, with labour market reform, that we get every piece of benefit we can to build a stronger Australian economy in the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to be able to advise all members of the House that the Bureau of Transport Economics has today released a very important report. In fact, I think it is a report which in time will be seen as a bit of a defining moment in the quest for an improved productivity performance on the Australian waterfront. The report demonstrates that in each of the three months to June of this year - April, May and June - Australia recorded the best productivity on the Australian waterfront that we have ever had since the commencement of the series. This is not just an improvement in one or two ports; this is an improvement right across the board and in particular in the big ports in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle, where of course the reform process has been a long hard road to achieve. The jump in this month's quarter is up from 20 lifts an hour to 23 lifts an hour. We are getting much closer to the government's target of 25 lifts an hour, which was the benchmark objective that we set.I am also able to say to the House that we have had independent reports from both the stevedores that on many occasions they have exceeded these figures by a very significant margin, demonstrating what we have always said, which was always denied by the Labor Party, and that is that, with significant reform on the waterfront, we can have a decent performance. That is, of course, not to say that there is not more work to be done, but I can report to the parliament that all the rorts and the rip-offs -  - supported by the Labor Party for years - all those rip-offs on the waterfront - are in fact now behind us. -  - We are now achieving 23 crane lifts an hour -  -  - but with basically half the number of people who were employed there when the Labor Party was in charge. I think many members -  - I think members might remember what John Coombs told the Australian Financial Review on 19 November last year. He said:We used to boast that we could stop the country in 15 minutes on the phone. You just had to phone the delegates, and they would walk off the job ... The fact is we can no longer do what we did.  -  - This country had been bedevilled for years by a waterfront where the unions could basically hold this country to ransom. All through that reform process, the fact is that the Labor Party opposed reform -  -  - So successful have these changes on the waterfront been that, only last week on 5 October, Bob Carr, the New South Wales Labor Premier, said in the Sydney Morning Herald:These are the sorts of boasts you can routinely make of this country now. What are you doing about productivity, the president of the World Bank, Jim Wolfensohn, asked me? I was able to respond that our labour productivity growth in the `90s was stronger in Australia than the US. In underground mining and on the waterfront, two once-laggard industries, our productivity is up with the world's best.No Labor Premier was ever able to say that when Labor was in office and, furthermore, if Labor is ever in office again, its policy to abolish the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act -  - and to go back to industry bargaining is just an invitation to go back to the way the waterfront was before this government came in.</DOC>

 - I certainly wrote to the Prime Minister and said that the matter should go to the police. - That was in May.  - The matter first came to my notice on 30 August 1999. It came to my notice because a member of the Department of Finance and Administration approached my personal assistant and asked her whether or not I was still using my telecard. She said, `No, he isn't.' She asked me about it, and I had not used my card for some time. I can advise the House that what had transpired was that a person at Telstra was looking at my account - he knew my name, obviously, because of my public duties - and came to the conclusion that there was no way known that a federal minister could make such phone calls. He was referring in particular to the period 1 January 1999 to 30 August when he made contact with us. Just to give you a sense of it, he sent an email to DOFA, which gave me a copy, which said that in the nine-month period to 30 August there were 619 calls to Malaysia, 448 calls from Singapore, 317 calls to Singapore, 389 calls from various mobile phones and 478 calls from various countries back to Australia - 2,301 calls in total costing $9,100.45. So my immediate reaction was: obviously I have not been using the card, obviously this card has fallen into the wrong hands, as it were, and there was unauthorised use.On that day I had someone from my office ring DOFA after I had seen that material and had been advised accordingly and we said to DOFA, `The minister has not been using it; obviously there should be a full inquiry by the department.' As we later were told, there were 11,000 calls roughly from approximately 900 locations. I was advised of that in about April. I certainly had a long discussion with DOFA and gave them all the information I had. As a consequence of that which, as I best understand it from DOFA, had sort of brought their investigations to a certain level, I advised the Prime Minister and said that I thought the matter should go to the police. In terms of my knowledge of this prior to 30 August, the fact is that, like many members, I certainly had a telecard. It was issued to me in the early 1990s. I stopped using it when I got a mobile phone, which I think was around 1994, and basically never gave any further consideration to the telecard. - In respect of the accounts, the senators and members handbook in 1996 and some of the other handbooks around that time that I have looked at say specifically, `Costs for telephone charge card use will appear on electorate office telephone accounts as a single line showing the number of calls and total costs.' The fact of the matter is that it was never so provided to me, and I would suggest that it has not been provided to any member in the parliament. - To fully answer the question, Mr Speaker, the senators and members handbook made it quite clear and advised members that they would be told of telecard usage. I then asked DOFA whether or not at any time they had provided me with any information about the use of the telecard. Their response was that a minister of the government of the day had made arrangements so that members were not so informed. I can only tell you what I have been told. - In respect of the card -  -  - I am quite happy to tell you about the card or give you any other details you want. Members were issued a card, and that card had on it numbers, and in addition to that they were given a PIN. -  - As all members who have used this card would know, you do not need to physically have the card to use the number and the PIN. By some means, which is the subject of police investigation, the details on the card and the PIN have come into the possession of people unknown to me. For the sake of completeness, since I have been asked a question about it, it is a fact that I gave my son the card and the number and the PIN.  - I am quite happy to answer the question; I am attempting to do so. - He was a student at the time. He was going on an interstate trip. Expecting that I would not necessarily be at home, I said to him, `If you have some particular reason to contact me, this is a means that you can use to do so.' That is basically the only conversation I ever had with him about it. The best we can ascertain is that over five years his usage was to the value of about $950. As soon as I became aware of that, as is the normal case with other people where there has been expenditure outside the entitlement, I repaid the money. Should I have given him the card? No, I do not think I should have. That is a fact. I had not appreciated that he had used it. The irony of it is that, for a lot of the phone calls that he made to home, if he had made them on a reverse charge, this would not have come up. But it has come up. As has been advised, the matter is with the police. That is the proper place for it to be. I hope that they will bring their investigations to a timely conclusion.</DOC>

 - Farmers certainly have been great supporters of waterfront reform and they have a right to take a share of the pleasure associated with the good news in the latest Bureau of Transport Economics study on waterfront reform. An efficient, effective and dynamic waterfront is absolutely essential if our country is going to achieve its full potential as an export nation. We all have memories of the horrors of the docks - the holding up of farm exports and, indeed, the whole of the trade of our nation, under the previous government. During the life of the previous government, 25 per cent - a quarter - of all industrial disputes on the waterfront in the world were on Australian waterfronts. A quarter of the whole world's supply of industrial disputes was on our waterfront, even though we had only one per cent of trade. Fortunately, that is being turned around. The laughing stock of Australian industrial relations, the embarrassment to our country, is now being turned around with this improved performance in grain handling facilities and with greater reliability of dock space for vessels when they arrive. Our ports are becoming more reliable. Since a significant proportion of our exports, including farm exports, leave in containers, that is very good news for Australian farmers. Around $1 billion worth of our wine exports leave in containers; half a billion dollars worth of rice, $2 billion worth of wool, significant quantities of dairy products and grains, $1½ billion worth of cotton and $2 billion worth of veal and other meat are now able to move more smoothly and more effectively across the waterfront. I would like to congratulate the minister on his achievements in taking on the tough fight on the waterfront. He took them on. Now there is a culture change on our waterfront. We still have some distance to go - there are still more reforms to be undertaken - but there has been a culture change on the waterfront. No longer do people turn up to work for the union or when the union thinks they ought to be there. They now recognise that they have a task to do and they want to do it efficiently and well. So this change certainly represents a significant improvement. It will boost our nation's export competitiveness and give our farmers a chance to trade freely and fairly around the world. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calwell for the question, because it does give me an opportunity to say to the honourable member and to members of this House that Australia has the most creditable record amongst civilised nations for the extent to which it assists refugees. We have nothing to apologise for at all. We are a country, one of seven or eight countries around the world, that has been largely immune from significant refugee outflows and yet, nevertheless, has conducted the largest per capita refugee resettlement program in the world. It has been a mark of our generosity as a nation and as a people that we have continued to do that under governments of both political persuasions over a long period of time.  -  - Yes, the honourable member makes the observation that per capita we have been the most generous, but in the context of the extent to which we are now beset by a number of asylum claims in Australia our per capita resettlement program is the second largest in the world.But if you were to add to that - which many people seem to have forgotten - the 4,000 people from Kosovo whom we took on a temporary basis, and the almost 2,000 people we took from East Timor in addition to the 12,000 people who have made asylum claims successfully or been resettled in Australia, there was an effective 50 per cent increase under this government last year in the numbers of people who were assisted. It would have made it the record program under any government over decades. That is not something we hear praised by the member for Calwell. I do not suppose I would expect him to praise it. It is not something that I hear praised by the advocacy groups, who have another agenda. I understand that. But the fact is that not only have we that generous program in place but we have the most developed program of any country in the world for assisting people who are refugees in the resettlement process. - The member says, `Rubbish.' - Take the time out -  - I know that people will want me to conclude fairly quickly, and there is a lot I would like to say on this particular subject. But we do have the most elaborate and sophisticated program for assisting people who have suffered torture and trauma, people who need to develop language skills and those who have come through the program in an efficacious way.Last week I had the opportunity of attending a meeting of the international community in the form of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There is an international crisis in relation to the way in which resources are applied and the demands that are being placed on developed countries like Australia through the asylum system. One ought not to use the fact that amongst some asylum seekers there are refugees to disguise the obscene - and I use that word deliberately - misuse of resources in developed countries like Australia to deal with asylum claims in comparison to the needs of people who are refugees around the world.When honourable members understand, as the international community is starting to understand, that developed countries like Australia spend something like $10 billion a year through sophisticated, elaborate and jurisprudential models for determining asylum claims - that is, as the member for Bowman says, doing justice, and that justice gives people the opportunity to exploit every opportunity to test their claims in Australia - it means that in comparison the 50,000 or so genuine refugees amongst half a million asylum seekers in developed countries use up something like $10 billion worth of resources and yet the UNHCR, to look after the world's 22.7 million refugees and people of concern, has only $1 billion. If the UNHCR had to use our systems to determine who were refugees, it would need something like $440 billion to be able to go through the process.We would be able, if we made savings of 10 per cent in what we spend in dealing with asylum claims, to double what we spend in supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I suspect that, even out of this Minister for Finance and Administration, I might have been able to get a little bit of a dividend if I had been able to deliver those savings. But I make the point: if the international community could save one-tenth, we could double the UNHCR's budget to $2 billion. Instead of having the situation where we spend something like 11c a day on looking after a refugee in Africa, we would be able to put resources into supporting them more effectively, instead of the hundreds of dollars a day we have to spend in assessing, in relation to people who are here for long periods of time, asylum claims in this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. The government's school funding policies are designed, as the member for Bradfield suggests, to put downward pressure on school fees. This puts them in dramatic contrast to the policies which the Labor Party pursued when in office. No party in fact has done more to force school fees up than the Labor Party. The fundamental fallacy of the position that is being put by the Labor Party is that, when parents work hard to build up the resources and facilities at a school, support for those parents should fall and that school fees should be forced to rise so that that school becomes less and less accessible. This government believe that, when parents make an effort to invest in education, we should widen access to that school to give more parents the opportunity to educate their children using those facilities.In New South Wales, this aversion to choice in education appears, today, to be driving education policy. We have seen comments from Dr Ken Boston, the highly paid official of the Carr Labor government, who has implemented policies designed to restrict access to non-government schools and ratchet up fees, apparently in an effort to prevent the continuing outflow of students from government schools in that state. I would have to say that I think that Dr Boston's contribution has been little short of scandalously inaccurate and unprecedented for a professional public servant. One can only speculate about his real motives.Under Dr Boston and Mr Aquilina, 20,000 students have left the New South Wales government schools system over the last four years. The New South Wales government is consistently underfunding government schools in that state. In the last budget the Commonwealth government, the Howard government, increased funding for government schools in New South Wales by over four per cent, whereas in the Carr government's budget funding increased by less than two per cent. Some 50 per cent of all the capital expenditure on government schools in New South Wales is coming from the Commonwealth at the moment. In New South Wales the Carr government makes the lowest contribution to building up the capital stock, the buildings, of government schools of any mainland state government. Dr Boston has presided over 18 months of teacher disputes, strikes and 20 lost-teacher days while at the same time pocketing, one would have to say, a lucrative $20,000 bonus from the New South Wales government for his services. That works out at about $1 for every student who has left the government schools sector. Whether it was provided by the New South Wales Treasury or not, I do not know, but we can look to the next bonus with some degree of trepidation.New South Wales has now instituted a review of non-government school funding policies. It has cut money from the non-government schools on a totally unjustifiable ground of the EBA. The Sydney Morning Herald reports this morning:Fear of retaliation by the State Government will stop many private schools reducing their fees ...In other words, the natural tendency of the Commonwealth's policies to push down school fees is being deliberately undermined by the Labor Party government in New South Wales. It is no different in this approach to high school fees than the Labor Party when it was in office federally; all its policies were designed to make schools less accessible. That was the reason why you failed to fund new low fee schools at their appropriate level of need. That is why, since this government abolished the new schools policy, some 113 new low fee schools have opened, which would never have opened under your policy. This government believes in school choice. We believe that people are entitled to build up the resources of schools and that they should not be punished for that. This government approach is to encourage parent choice. The policies of the Labor Party are designed to undermine parent choice and to drive up the fees facing all parents at all schools.</DOC>

 - As to its wider usage, that is entirely a matter for the police. I have had a long discussion with the police. My son who lives and works in London was out here during the middle of the year. We made arrangements for him to meet with the police, and he gave them all the information that he has. In particular, in answer to the question whether or not he had given the details to anybody, he has strongly denied that. But that and all matters are entirely matters for the police, and that is where it rests. - What was the first part, sorry? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I have said to the House, I did give the card to my son, and I should not have done so. There is a Remuneration Tribunal determination which says that you must only use the card personally, and I was in breach of that. I must say, though, that, as a member of the federal parliament and not often at home, I gave it to him because I thought that if he needed to contact me -  -  - He could ring home at any time but, if I was in a hotel somewhere else and he was stuck somewhere and he wanted to contact his father, I thought he could do so. - I am sorry, but that is the basis upon which I gave it to him. It is in breach of the tribunal, and I have said that quite openly to the PM. As soon as I knew about the matter, obviously I repaid the amounts. I should say also, as members know, that other people have found themselves in the situation where they have been outside of the entitlement and, where the matter has been brought to their attention, they have repaid those moneys. As I also said earlier, I had no means of knowing that the card was actually being used.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I note that unemployment in the Parramatta region peaked at no less than 20.7 per cent in February 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training - a job which he described at the time as a `poison chalice'. Unemployment in Parramatta was 13 per cent in March 1996. I am sure all members of the House will be delighted to know that unemployment in Parramatta is now just 3.4 per cent thanks to the policies of the Howard government, and those policies of course include Work for the Dole. Since November 1997, there have been 14 Work for the Dole projects in Parramatta, which have given nearly 500 job seekers valuable work experience in things like environmental restoration, working with community groups and boosting local facilities. I have just become aware of a new Work for the Dole proposal in Parramatta to restore 42 hectares of degraded bushland which is part of the Vineyard Creek catchment. This proposal has the support of the local catchment committee. It has the support of nearby Macquarie Boys Technology High School. It has the support of local community work coordinators. The only group which does not support this proposal is Parramatta City Council under the leadership of the Left faction Labor Lord Mayor. In fact, what we are seeing here is a bit of a family feud inside Labor's ruling class. You have the member for Batman saying that community groups should participate in Work for the Dole and you have his brother, the member for Reid, who has vetoed participation by his factional acolytes on Parramatta City Council. There is hope for the Vineyard Creek project and for other community initiatives in Parramatta. The Labor Lord Mayor has been replaced, so I now call on Parramatta City Council to participate in Work for the Dole and give Parramatta job seekers a fair go.</DOC>

 - The chief executive of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency, Mr Tim Burns, wrote to me and informed me that there were three assessors who had done their course, had passed their course and had not been registered by the registration agency. The letter that he wrote to me said that a decision was made still to use those three assessors, and nine accreditation audits took place in the course of a week. Those facilities have been contacted, fresh audits have been arranged and Mr Burns is personally apologising to each of the facilities for the inconvenience caused. It was quite clear that the decision that was taken by the agency to allow those audits to go ahead when the registration of those assessors had not taken place, despite the fact that they had completed their courses, was the wrong decision for the agency to have made. Hence, the reaccreditation audits will take place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for what is a very important question and builds on the nationally significant announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister of a new $1.4 billion program to address salinity and water quality issues. The member for Mallee is amongst the many members in this place who live with the issues of salinity and water quality all the time. He is in a very productive electorate, one which is providing a great deal of leadership in the way in which water can be used wisely and well to extend production in a sustainable way. This action plan has the potential to mobilise the community to address issues which are of great significance to all Australians. There are many communities already where there is evidence of the damage that can be caused by salinity, and they are not all in rural Australia; there are many examples also where urban salinity is a significant issue and where the problems need to be addressed. At last we have a government that is prepared to take a positive step and to provide the leadership to help mobilise the states and local communities towards a nationally coordinated plan of action. I welcome the generally supportive response from the community. Indeed, we even had a press release from the Leader of the Opposition which was warmer than we usually get, but of course Labor would have done it differently. They always have a different approach that they would have taken. There are some concerns in the community about the different approach that Labor would choose to adopt. They make it clear that, as far as they are concerned, they would tell the states what to do. They would tie any government contributions to abiding by a plan developed by Canberra. There would be no avenues for local consultation and no capacity to address and mobilise the issues at the local level. I think that demonstrates one of the very clear differences between our approach to these vital issues and Labor's. Labor believe in the big stick. They believe in attempting to belt people around the ears and particularly demand that states sign up irrespectively. We acknowledge that one size does not fit all. The issues are vastly different. From the Murray-Darling to North Queensland, salinity issues are at different stages in many places. There are large parts of Queensland where salinity is not an issue at all, but of course that does not mean that appropriate care should not be taken in the future. Our action plan is not antidevelopment; it is about ensuring that development is sustainable and that we use our water wisely and well.As a result of this strategy, we have the opportunity to mobilise communities through local action plans and the development of specific endeavours to ensure that water quality is maintained throughout the nation and we address some of the degradation issues associated with salinity. This is a major initiative. I welcome the cooperative response that we have had from many of the states, and I hope that the opposition will drop its negativity and seek to work cooperatively with land-holders, not seek to strip away their rights, as so often happens, or in Queensland and New South Wales take away the rights of land-holders without any compensation. We recognise there will be some costs associated with a strategy of this nature, and they have to be met by the whole community. Our approach is different from Labor's. We will achieve real outcomes; Labor will just continue to argue and achieve absolutely nothing to redress these major national concerns.</DOC>

 - Centrelink and the government have introduced a number of measures to try and get more compliance and to get more accuracy of payments. Of course, that is what taxpayers demand. As far as Centrelink is concerned, over one-third of the budget goes out in social security payments. With the family payments, we have introduced a policy of full reconciliation. That means that we are encouraging those receiving social security payments, and particularly family assistance, to ensure that they declare to Centrelink their correct earnings. This means that, for the first time, as at the end of this financial year, those individuals and those families -  - The Leader of the Opposition may choose to listen to this. Those families that overestimate their income for the first time will be able to have a top-up payment to ensure that they get their correct entitlement. Why should we not be encouraging families to get their correct entitlement? Under these changes, for the first time, they will be able to receive more if they have overestimated their income. This is a measure that we have introduced. The important point is that there have been enormous increases to families - over $2.4 billion in family assistance, something that you never provided - and very generous savings bonuses that go towards older Australians, which you never provided when you introduced wholesale sales taxes and failed to give tax cuts.</DOC>

 - The Commonwealth government has announced some wonderful initiatives and I thank the member for Ballarat for his continuing interest and, particularly, for the representations he has made to me on behalf of the problems associated with the Avoca catchment. The Commonwealth's announcement of a salinity action plan is just that: a plan for action that will maximise both economic and ecological gains for our nation. In the area of South Australia and the city of Adelaide, it will maintain a very important resource for that city in terms of its water supplies. It will do so by initiating a national effort at the Commonwealth, state and community levels by utilising already available data research and new Commonwealth government agency initiatives arising from research introducing aerial magnetic data information from enhanced analysis, which I call the `ultrasound' of the earth. This, in conjunction with other known information, allows us to now identify the locality of salt, the quantities that are in the soil, the depth at which it is in the soil and, where it is in a stream, the direction of flow.Suddenly, we have a planning tool that will give us the opportunity to be very surgical in our approach to this problem. A classic example already discovered is the Haughligan Creek, accredited with delivering some 13 tonnes of salt a day into the Murrumbidgee system from a surface flow. The new technology has identified that the real villain is 40 metres below the ground, and that salt is eventually intersecting with the surface river. At 40 metres, a reafforestation project would have no benefit whatsoever, and we must of course revert to engineering solutions already practised in the Riverland of South Australia, where we intercept such salt flows with pumps and other activity and pump it to evaporation ponds, where even that salt can be turned into an economic benefit. The whole background to this policy is to bring the economy and the ecology together. These sorts of solutions are very important.In terms of the Murray-Darling, suggestions that wide scale reafforestation would fix the problem overlook the scientific fact that we would achieve a 20 per cent reduction in freshwater surface flows to that river system from those reafforested areas. So that would have downside effects in Adelaide and in the great Murray irrigation areas. In other words, the Howard government is doing its homework and will propose outcomes the development of which it is prepared to support financially. It now seeks the support and involvement of the constitutional land managers, the states, to confront this problem in a joint effort. Most state governments have responded positively, but one has not. Premier Beattie has felt obliged to refer in the paper to this very positive, well-planned, well-documented commitment as a `stunt'. When it comes to stunts, there is no greater expert than Premier Beattie - in fact, he is a gold medal performer. The fact is that it is time that Premier Beattie got out of the make-up room and got into the engine room of his state. It is time that he took some responsibility for what happens. Premier Beattie still thinks a forest product is a ballot paper or an Electoral Commission white card! The reality is that he has done nothing in an environmental sense. What happens every time he is asked to address the environment in Queensland? Does he do what other state governments have done - get on with the job? No, he comes running down here and says, `If you don't give me the money, I won't do it.' New South Wales did not take that position on land clearing. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia did not think that was necessary. Why does Mr Beattie always have to avoid his responsibility by trying to lay the blame elsewhere? At last, when he gets the opportunity to join with the Commonwealth in an arrangement where there will be substantial Commonwealth funding, what does he do? He calls it a stunt. He only understands politics; he does not understand the environmental management of his state. It is time he gave the people an opportunity to make a change. But there is a bit of a problem: let's sort out the electoral rolls first.</DOC>

 - I am not quite sure about the issue that the member for Cowan is raising. If he has had a representation from a veteran in relation to an overpayment where the mistake has been made by my department, he should make that representation to my office. If he is genuinely interested in the welfare of veterans in this country, rather than turning them into a political football he would make representation to my office. I would also remind the House that, as many would be aware, we have one of the most, if not the most, generous repatriation systems in the world. - I remind the other side of the House that, as I have said in this House before, my door is always open for representations on behalf of the very special people of our country - the veterans and war widows.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. I can inform her that recent surveys of business confidence in Australia show that business confidence remains strong, consistent with a strongly growing economy. The most recent of those is the national survey, which was released yesterday, saying that, notwithstanding that business conditions were down, business confidence was strongly up. That confirms the outcome from the national accounts in June this year showing that, for the 13th consecutive quarter, the Australian economy grew above four per cent, a record of growth which has not been matched since we took measurements in Australia. There have been periods where there has been higher growth followed by credit squeezes or recessions - or, in the case of the Labor Party, the recession it said Australia had to have! - but we have not had growth above four per cent for 13 consecutive quarters. As the world economy strengthens, I expect that will also strengthen Australia's exports, making sure that they contribute to growth in forthcoming quarters.The productivity improvement in Australia has also been very strong, with multifactor productivity in Australia growing throughout the 1990s faster than in the United States - something that is not commonly understood. So we have a high growth, low inflation, high productivity economy. I have seen some claims that the all-ordinaries index in Australia does not have a substantial share of market capitalisation in the so-called new economy stocks. Can I say that measuring new economy stocks in the all-ordinaries index to include telecommunications, media and technology shows that the percentage in those stocks - which was two per cent in 1990 - is now, in the year 2000, at 32 per cent.In addition, I can inform the member for McEwen that Merrill Lynch recently released a global ranking system designed to estimate growth potential of economies around the world. It ranked Australia third out of 35 countries with growth potential - third after Sweden and Singapore - narrowly beating the United States into fourth place. The OECD found recently in its report on the science, technology and industry outlook:... small OECD countries - Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway -  have all undertaken a broad programme of structural reform which has improved the business climate, strengthened competition, pushed firms to improve performance and enabled innovation and growth to flourish.There have been structural reforms in the economy, together with our openness to new technology and the reforms in industrial relations. I pay tribute to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business for having the courage to push through landmark reform on the waterfront - this landmark reform on the waterfront now being hailed by Premier Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, for lifting productivity on the waterfront. It is the lift of the productivity potential, it is the leadership that is shown by ministers such as the minister for workplace relations and it is the leadership in relation to taxation that are going to give Australia the growth opportunities. One thing you can say about the last decade is that young kids have a much better chance of getting a job under a coalition government than they ever had under the Labor Party. We intend to give them a better future.</DOC>

 - Members might remember that on the waterfront we had the practice of double headers. Double headers meant that if a ship -  - was not stevedored in one period of time, then the arrangement was that you would have to finish the stevedoring in the second shift. It was widely acknowledged -  - that the system then operating on the waterfront -  - was that people would go slow on one shift so they could get onto the double header. - On those double headers you would be paid double time and a half for the whole of the shift, even though you had timed it so that it would only take you an hour or so to finish and you could thereby achieve double time and a half for the whole eight or nine hour shift. No-one, apart from the Labor Party, thought that that was a fair deal. Furthermore, the people who were involved in that knew exactly what was happening. It was public knowledge. - In respect of the usage of my telecard, the fact is that I did not know. And the reason I did not know is the previous Labor government put in place a system that I did not know.  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects and says we put that system in place for privacy reasons. - You claim it was from us, okay. - I do not see that as a matter of dispute. No-one in this House would quibble with the idea that there should be privacy arrangements made in respect of people's telephone calls. If you are in the Labor Party and somebody gets access to all of the telephone calls you have made for a preselection faction contest, that would be a matter of political embarrassment.I do not make that statement as some sort of cheap political point on my behalf as an accusation, but it is the fact. The fact is that none of us knew - not one person in this chamber knew what their telecard account was. Like most people, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised when they rang up and said there had been this massive use of my telecard. The simple reason for that is not only was I not told but on the public record the senators and members handbook was telling us that we would be told. Because I never used my telecard - basically had stopped using it - I was perfectly entitled, as every other member in this House would be entitled, to assume that, if they were not telling you when they said they would tell you if you were using it, then obviously I got no information, therefore I knew nothing about it.It is said that I paid back two per cent - that is the Labor claim in the Senate. The fact is that I sat down with the Department of Finance and Administration and they went through every account. For those accounts that were related to me and/or my son I paid back 100 per cent. That was done by me and at the same time I said that I believed the police ought to come in and investigate the matter. So the very simple answer to this matter is that I was not informed until August last year and when I was so informed I acted properly and ensured that people were properly informed as to all the circumstances, as I knew them. The government then properly followed the processes already put in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. With little more than 10 weeks to go now until the end of the school year Labor still has no position on the schools funding legislation in the Senate. Commonwealth funding for all schools dries up on 31 December. Unless the Senate passes the legislation without delay schools are going to face serious budgetary difficulties. An open letter has been sent to all senators urging quick passage of the legislation. The letter says:The bill is a significant reform and a fairer and more valid measure of need than the present ERI scheme.It goes on to say:Any further delays in the passage of the bill would certainly cause serious problems for the more than 2,500 non-government schools that have no funding certainty beyond December this year. It is therefore important for this bill to be passed quickly, and the undersigned organisations seek assurance from all senators that the bill will pass through the Senate as soon as possible.That letter is signed by the Most Reverend Goodhew, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, on behalf of the Anglican Church of Australia, the Reverend Professor James Haire on behalf of the Uniting Church of Australia, Peter Crimmins on behalf of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, Dr Bruce Yulden on behalf of the Seventh Day Adventist schools; Adrian Jericho on behalf of the Lutheran schools, signatories for the Rudolf Steiner Schools Association of Heads of Independent Schools, and the NCISA. Not only have all the leaders of the Protestant churches in Australia written to the Senate requesting immediate passage of the legislation; the bill also has the endorsement of the National Catholic Education Commission and all the Australian Catholic bishops. Only the Labor Party says that this bill is unfair. It is time for the leader of the Labor Party to exercise some leadership and determine what the Labor Party's position actually is on the bill. Yesterday the member for Dobell said:The opposition moved amendments in the House of Representatives debate and will be moving amendments in the Senate.But today the Australian reports that:A spokesman for opposition leader Kim Beazley said yesterday the Labor Party had not decided on how or whether it would seek to amend the bill.So we have the usual typical policy confusion in the ranks of the Labor Party. It is so dedicated to misrepresenting this legislation that it has isolated itself from all the Australian churches on this matter of educational equity. No-one believes the position. The Labor Party, through the Leader of the Opposition, tries to defend a discredited, politically corrupt funding system which has been abandoned by everybody else in the non-government sector. It is time for this weak Leader of the Opposition to decide what the Labor Party's position is on the bill and get his colleagues in the Senate to pass it as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - Let me make it clear -  -  - There is no-one I know who has worked harder to advance the cause of low fee Christian schools, particularly in Victoria, than the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. This question is all about the Labor Party's theme today of double standards. There are no double standards on this side of the House. If we wanted examples of double standards, they may be seen in the fact that the leaders of the Labor Party - from Bob Hawke to Paul Keating to Kim Beazley to Simon Crean - all sent or send their children to private schools, whose fees they want to put up out of the reach of ordinary Australians and the people who are entitled to educational choice. That is an example of double standards - pursuing a policy which is designed to push school fees up out of the reach of ordinary Australians while they access those schools themselves. Let us have no more cant and hypocrisy from you on that side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I know that she will be very pleased to hear, as other members on this side will be, that we are seeing an ever increasing usage of the Australian workplace agreement, which is a form of agreement introduced by this government back in 1996 and which, importantly, gives people choice at work - whether an employee or employer - as to how they settle their arrangements. During September we had 5,534 AWAs filed and 5,529 approved, bringing to an all time record high the quarter figures for the volume of AWAs filed and approved. AWAs are working; they are increasingly being taken up by the community in the business sector. The number of AWAs approved in the first nine months of this year is 52 per cent higher than the corresponding period in 1999. Whilst the numbers are of importance and, obviously, of interest, the other point to make is that people have a choice. It is not a question of the numbers; it is just the fact that we believe workers and employers ought to have a choice about how they go about running their own businesses.I am also pleased to be able to say that we introduced a form of collective agreement, which is called a 170LK. That form of collective agreement is not with the union but with the workers directly. The Labor Party talk about collective bargaining, but their idea of a collective bargain is all the workers being told what to do by the unions. It is certainly never the idea of the rank and file of the workers themselves getting together and collectively bargaining. We introduced that system. It is another choice we gave people. As at 30 June this year there have been 2,177 of those agreements, covering approximately 197,000 workers. When you put those two forms of agreement together, we are talking about well in excess of 300,000 - probably 320,000 - people who have had the benefit of a new system that we have introduced.Looking forward and seeing the continuing growth of AWAs and the non-union collective agreements, then we would think that, as at August of this year, there could have been in excess of 467,400 employees covered by both sorts of agreement. I mention that figure of nearly half a million employees because if the Labor Party are ever elected and get their way then those half a million employees will have a basic choice denied to them because the Labor Party do not like people making agreements without the union bosses dictating the outcome. These agreements have meant that people have enjoyed higher pay, more flexible arrangements and family friendly arrangements. It is part of a modern work force that employers and employees should be able to make these arrangements.Why is this important? There has recently been a very interesting survey by the Business Council of Australia. They asked their CEOs what they thought about the need for further reform in the area of workplace relations. Ninety-one per cent of these chief executives said they wanted to see further reform but, more importantly for the community as a whole, their view was that such reforms could deliver a 20 per cent improvement in business performance across Australia. Think of the increase in living standards for ordinary workers that we could have if we could get that sort of improvement in the business community.We have made a lot of reforms but, as these business leaders are saying, the opportunity costs of the system, its limiting act on the art of the possible and its capacity to obstruct, deter and delay change, innovation and improvement are basically holding the system back. They are absolutely right, and what is the Labor Party's policy? Not only are they not looking forward, their policy is to go back to a system Australia discarded in the 1970s. It was a system that even the Labor Party discarded. Now, of course, it is policy for the Labor Party if they are elected. The people who will miss out if Labor's policy were ever enacted are the very rank and file people they claim to represent. We are determined to continue reforms because this means a better deal, particularly for the workers.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition has asked me when I was first advised of a matter relating to an unusual amount occurring on the telecard of one of my colleagues. I was informed of that in April this year. I can further inform the House that the Special Minister of State, who has responsibility under the administrative orders for these areas of members' ministerial and parliamentary services, was informed of it in August last year. At that time, my colleague the minister for workplace relations, as he has informed the House, also became aware of it. At that time, as is the normal process, an extensive investigation was instigated by the department of finance. That investigation into the numerous calls that related to that account - it involved over 11,000 calls made from several hundred different locations - was undertaken by the internal audit committee, and subsequently referred to a senior departmental committee that is established in the normal course of events for such matters that may involve irregularities.Those matters were then canvassed with the minister for workplace relations in April and early May this year. The initiative was then taken by the minister for workplace relations - at least, with the concurrence of the minister for workplace relations; I believe at his request - to refer the matter to the Attorney-General for further investigation by the police. Those investigations are still going on. I believe the matter was brought by my colleague to the attention of the Prime Minister -  - when there was sufficient information from the extensive investigations that were being conducted by the Special Minister of State. I think all members would appreciate that there is an extensive amount of work that had to be conducted that was carried out diligently by the department, and matters were then progressed, as the House has been informed quite extensively over the last two days.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and his interest in this subject of telecommunications. The honourable member knows well, as do the Labor Party - not least of all the Leader of the Opposition - that Telstra's present state is untenable. After all, they are briefing the media and, indeed, some of the board members of merchant banks that that is the case. We know the Leader of the Opposition supports the privatisation of Telstra. He has a track record on this. We have the evidence of Frank Blount and others, which I will come to in a moment. The Leader of the Opposition's position on Telstra is the same as his position on the GST. He once opposed the GST; he now supports it. With private health insurance, once he passionately, totally, obsessively opposed it; now he supports it. It will be the same with funding for non-government schools. He is presently opposing it; but we have already got a sense that he is going to end up supporting it. He will do the same flip-flop on Telstra as he has on all those other matters. Frank Blount, the former head of Telstra, let the cat out of the bag when he told the Age last year that, before he took the job, he came out to Australia and he attended a meeting -  - Let everyone in this chamber be the judge. The Leader of the Opposition was minister for communications in 1991 and was about to appoint the most senior executive of the largest agency or business enterprise within his control. The prime candidate came out to Australia to test the water because, he said, `I wasn't going to go to Australia just to be the CEO of a company owned 100 per cent by government. I was all about trying to explore this with the government, with the minister of the day, with the head of the department of communications.' He came out to test the water. He tells us that he had a confidential meeting before his appointment, before he made up his mind, but he declines to say who the politician was. The minister for communications at the time was the current Leader of the Opposition. We also know from the Business Review Weekly article of 21 December 1988 that you were present at a meeting with Paul Keating when he offered John Prescott, head of BHP, the opportunity to buy Telstra. You were there. I do not see any denial now. You were there when Paul Keating -  - You were there when Paul Keating offered to privatise Telstra in September 1995. Look at him. He is not denying it. You were part and parcel of the Labor Party's -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. So the Leader of the Opposition was up to his neck in the previous Labor government's attempts to sell Telstra. We also know from the book by Mark Westfield that the Labor Party offered Telstra to the National Australia Bank. You were flogging it to whoever would possibly even consider the idea. You were part of it. - The Leader of the Opposition never attempted to dissuade the Prime Minister or the cabinet of the day from exploring the options, any more than he is dissuading the shadow minister for finance now. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage of his convictions. He is completely without ticker.</DOC>

 - The circumstances of the incurring of that $50,000 are, I am advised, the subject of a police investigation. I have not seen the outcome of that and, until I have seen the outcome of that, I do not think it is appropriate to make any judgment of the type that the Leader of the Opposition has made. I think it is quite unreasonable and highly political. Let's get one thing plain: nothing the opposition has said to date is based on principle; it is based on politics - politics pure and simple. The only other thing I would add is that there have been no limitations placed on the police investi-gation. The police have the right to investi-gate the conduct of the minister, the conduct of the minister's son and the conduct of any other people who may have been involved in this matter. In those circum-stances, to try to pre-empt the outcome of that investigation is plain absolute politick-ing and nothing else and is not based on any principles.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question because he does invite attention to a very interesting development in the context of migration to the United States of America. It is a matter about which there could be some useful observations in relation to policy approaches that are taken here. In that context, I do acknowledge that on 3 October the United States agreed to increase the number of temporary visas granted to skilled workers to 195,000 in each of the next three years. The legislation, like a lot of these things, was the subject of some debate and discussion. It is, however, the case that, unlike the United States of America, Australia has had a competitive approach in relation to gaining IT workers, in particular, through flexible temporary entry arrangements. Unlike the United States of America, we do not impose a numerical cap on the number of people who meet the skills criteria, in other words, who have the capacity to provide the skills that we need here in Australia in the very important IT area.Of course, in doing this, the government is responding to the needs of Australian business, and IT workers now make up the largest occupational group under our temporary entry arrangements. Since those streamlined temporary residence arrangements were introduced four years ago, there has been a 38 per cent increase in the number of business long stay visas granted. Under these arrangements, it is important that people are aware that we have a streamlined approach which is accommodating to business needs; we have labour market agreements with employers to bring in an agreed number of workers over a three-year period; and, unlike the United States of America and a number of other countries, Australia provides work rights to spouses of temporary business entrants. One of the other new factors in the United States has been the streamlining of access to permanent residency. In this they are emulating the model that we have here in Australia. In the past 12 months we have made a number of further changes to encourage the migration of young people with skills in demand, particularly by easing the tests in relation to labour market assessment as well as work experience, and we have now enabled the awarding of additional points to those whose occupations are on the high demand list. Further - and I commend the member for La Trobe for this - we have also made it easier for those overseas students who have gained skills in these areas in Australia to be able to access both temporary and permanent entry categories here in Australia, and I will be making some further announcements in relation to that shortly.What fascinates me in relation to others who think about policy approaches in this area is that the Labor Party in particular, having played a prominent role in developing the temporary entry regime through the commissioning of the Roach report - that report was initiated by a Labor government - at its national conference in Hobart flagged that it intends to roll back the temporary entry arrangements. What ought to be of concern to businesses in Australia that want to enhance what we are told we ought to call the knowledge nation is that the Labor Party wants to deprive Australian businesses of the skills of people -  - The honourable member says that he has not said that. I have a copy of his quote in relation to this matter. When he talked about temporary entry at the ALP conference he said, `That is not what the Labor Party is about.' The fact is we do seek, under the arrangements we have here in Australia, to use both temporary and permanent entry for satisfying employer needs. Both systems are easily accessible and efficient and are meeting industry requirements. The fact is that the temporary entry arrangements have been the arrangements of choice by industry, by employers, in Australia, rather than the permanent entry arrangements. It is not that the capacity is not there to use it; it is. As I have said to the executive director of the Business Council on a number of occasions when we have talked about this issue and when I have reminded the council that business do not use the permanent entry arrangements, permanent entry employer nomination is primarily used for chefs and religious workers, and IT workers are the only other group that substantially use employer arrangements. So I certainly hope that the Labor Party, when it has an opportunity to sit down and think about substantial issues about where this country ought to be going, will sit down and assess again the approach that it intends to take on this aspect of migration policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and recognise his interest, as a member of the Hawker committee and from the work that he does there, in small shareholders. The government has helped to create a very large small-shareholding nation here in Australia, and we have done it through a number of initiatives. Obviously, the most significant initiative we have put in place is the effective halving of capital gains tax. That is an incentive for people to enter the share market for the first time. We have also abolished stamp duty on the transfer of shares, something that the Labor Party opposed root and branch. We have empowered individuals by giving them more of their money in their pocket. We have significantly decreased income tax in Australia so that individuals for the first time have a very significant incentive to invest in the Australian stock market. For the first time 300,000 everyday Australians will this year receive an invitation to attend an annual general meeting of a public company. This means that 5.7 million Australians - 5.7 million Australians - who directly invest in shares will now have the opportunity to attend an annual general meeting, and at that AGM they will receive advice from company directors about the performance of their investment. Shareholders should take this opportunity to become more familiar with the workings of companies. They should ask questions about and vote on procedures that will affect the company's performance over the coming 12 months. The reporting season is also very important for all Australians who now indirectly invest in shares through their superannuation or through other managed funds, and their representatives have an obligation to vote at the AGMs as well. In fact, a Melbourne University study recently found that only 41 per cent of the shares in Australian companies were voted upon, and we would expect and hope that more Australian fund managers will be involved in voting at annual general meetings and in representing the interests of their members. This government is interested in empowering everyday Australians. We are interested in giving them an opportunity to have a say about how their money is invested and about how they are represented on the board. This is an important annual general meeting season that is coming up. The Labor Party wants to do everything it can to stop small shareholders from investing in companies, and the best evidence of that is its opposition to the further privatisation of Telstra.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dawson. I know she has been a real champion when it comes to sugar growers in Queensland, along with the other members of the Sugar Task Force - the member for Kennedy, the member for Hinkler, the member for Page, the member for Leichhardt and the member for Fairfax. They have worked very hard to ensure that the coalition government has come up with a rescue package for the sugar industry, particularly in Queensland, which has had very difficult conditions - low commodity prices, certainly the ravages of cyclones, disease, and, indeed, even a rat plague. There are four key elements to the package: income support; interest rate subsidies, one up to $50,000 to help cane growers get their crop into the ground and another interest rate subsidy up to $100,000; further support for getting the crop into the ground, along with harvesting; and, of course, financial counselling services. That is $83 million that the coalition government has given to the sugar industry right across Australia. So far, $1.45 million has been paid out to eligible cane growers - over 401 cane growers - and there has been assistance, particularly with loans, of over $1.1 million. In the electorate of Dawson, 176 growers have received income support payments, 17 growers have received replanting assistance and 29 growers have received interest rate relief. It is interesting to note a letter I have here from the Canegrowers Association in which the chief executive officer referred to `sincere appreciation for the manner and effort with which Centrelink management and staff have implemented the sugar industry package'. I hope the opposition - particularly the member for Lilley - are listening closely because of all the time they spend running down Centrelink. I would also like to quote this: `It has been a pleasure dealing with Centrelink. Not only did they understand our problems; they cared.' It sounds very much like the Howard-Anderson government. Compare this to the Queensland government, who are of course the cousins of the federal ALP, and particularly of some of the frontbenchers here. How much industry assistance package did the Queensland Labor Party give to the Queensland industry? Was it $70 million, was it $60 million, was it $50 million, $30 million, $20 million? It was $1 million of new money that went from the Queensland ALP to the sugar industry in Queensland. How outrageous is that? Is it any wonder they spend so much time fighting amongst themselves - and we know that certainly the member for Lilley has a vested interest in some matters that are happening at the moment in Queensland. -  - Exactly; there is one thing about a changing democracy. I would also like to note particularly two Centrelink staff members in Mackay, in the electorate of the member for Dawson: Ms Jill Richardson and Bridget Mather have been singled out, along with the rest of the staff there, for doing an excellent job. I would also like to acknowledge the enormous work that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and other cabinet ministers have put in to put this package together.</DOC>

 - I will have a look at that statement that I made. It was three years ago. The Leader of the Opposition is very complimentary in imagining that I carry those statements around, Mr Speaker. Can I just go back to the substance of this issue, and that is that the Leader of the Opposition makes allegations. Mr Speaker, I do not accept the basis of the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition. The issue is the subject of a police investigation. I have not seen the outcome of that, and in those circumstances I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to the answer I gave to the first question he asked me when I returned to question time, and I have finished my answer.  Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member asking the question should be aware, the Besley inquiry found that Australians generally have adequate access to a range of high quality basic and advanced telecommunications services. Senator Alston announced today that the federal government are committed to addressing the concerns that have been identified. We established the inquiry to do such a thing and we will not proceed to sell off the remaining 50.1 per cent of Telstra Corporation until those concerns are addressed. That is as plain and simple and as direct and honest as it can be - in stark contrast to the secret plans and deception of the Labor Party. Fancy the shadow minister trying to use the Besley inquiry findings against the government! This was an inquiry that they totally opposed - that they prevented in the Senate from being established by way of legislation so that we had to resort to administrative means - and then attacked from the very first day, going on to attack the character of the people leading the inquiry. I remind the honourable member for Perth of his own personalised attack on Mr Besley when, on 27 March this year, in regard to Mr Besley, he said, `There is a perception of an actual conflict of interest.' He went on to say, `The government should do the decent thing today and junk this inquiry.'As for the Leader of the Opposition, from the very first moment on 21 March 2000 he said, `The inquiry has all the hallmarks of a classic whitewash job.' You have no policy, you have opposed any constructive move by this government to address the issues of rural and regional Australia in the field of telecommunications and you have opposed the hundreds of millions of dollars that we have directed by way of Networking the Nation. You have no credibility and certainly no policy, but you do have a plan, and that is to privatise Telstra if you are in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. As the House is aware, this is National Mental Health Week. This morning I announced the establishment of the new National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention, which is to be chaired by Professor Ian Webster of New South Wales. One of the major obligations of that council will be to advise the government on the most effective distribution of most of the $48 million, funded over a period of years, for suicide prevention announced in the election campaign of 1998.I think members from both sides of the House would be very aware of the devastating and traumatic effect of suicide on the families of people who take their lives. The sad fact is that, despite so many other endowments, Australia has one of the highest youth suicide levels - particularly among young men in non-metropolitan areas - of any nation in the world. All of us on occasions have been touched - some very directly, some more indirectly - by the damaging consequences and tragedy of suicide. The government does not pretend that the establishment of this council is by itself a comprehensive answer to the problem, but it is an attempt at a national level - and Professor Webster made this comment when the council was launched this morning - to coordinate the efforts of governments, private welfare bodies and others, particularly health professionals, to see if we can make a difference.Australia has been more successful than most in marshalling the resources of both the public and private sectors to tackle these national health problems. It is fair to say that the campaign against HIV-AIDS in the 1980s, which was launched by the former government and carried on by the present government, has been relatively more successful than similar programs in many other countries - although there is no cause for complacency on that front. It is that same streak of collaboration between the private health sector and government health authorities which will underpin our approach. The new council will give highest priority to community based suicide prevention services. It will seek to build partnerships, within local communities, between government, community and non-government organisations. I have today, in earnest of the government's commitment in this area, announced details of funding of $2.9 million to various organisations spread throughout Australia for suicide prevention projects. We are also providing additional resources on an annual basis over the next four years of $100,000 a year for the youth counselling service, Kids Help Line, which is going to make it possible for that organisation to handle another 15,000 to 16,000 calls a year.As an example of how Australia has, in a sense, pioneered behaviour and attitudes, it remains my understanding that the first ever phone help service for people who were in need of immediate counselling was established in Australia by the then Central Methodist Mission, by Sir Alan Walker, in Sydney in the 1960s. That has now grown into the modern manifestation called Lifeline, and the pattern of that organisation has been copied around the world. That stands today as a marvellous example of Australian innovation in providing grassroots help to people. There are thousands of volunteers in Australia who, seven nights a week, make their services available to organisations like Kids Help Line, Lifeline and many other worthy organisations to give people in desperate need of help some encouragement to continue struggling against some of the burdens life has given them. All those organisations need to be commended. We all need to work harder at tackling the terrible problem of youth suicide. It is an awful tragedy and an awful blight. I hope that our national council makes a small but important contribution towards alleviating that problem.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can understand that, with the length of the question, you may have forgotten whom it was originally addressed to. I thank the honourable member for drawing attention to the quite appropriate response of National Party figures to the Besley report. This report clearly emphasises, as the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation quite correctly identified, that Australians have the advantage of one of the best telecommunications systems in the world. But there are parts of Australia where services are not yet adequate. The report endorsed comments made by the National Party, and indeed by many people in regional Australia and representatives from country electorates, that there are areas such as the adequacy of business telecommunications, mobile phone coverage and the like where more work needs to be done. This government has already made a very substantial contribution and real commitments in that regard. The Networking the Nation fund, which is providing considerable improvements, was something that Labor voted against - Labor was opposed to all of these sorts of measures. They have no trouble developing secret plans to sell off the whole of Telstra, but when it comes to actually making constructive developments towards improving the service, their minds are utterly vacant. They have no proposals whatsoever to deal with these issues.In response to the Besley report, this government has announced its determination to develop an action plan to address the issues of concern. As has already been pointed out, the legislation to sell more of Telstra will not be introduced until the plan to address these issues has been put in place. That is a commitment which the National Party is happy to subscribe to. This report has been an excellent observation on the state of telecommunications in Australia. It appropriately acknowledges the achievements that have already been made and it identifies the concerns that still have to be addressed. The National Party along with the rest of the coalition government is determined to get on with addressing those concerns.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I am pleased to hear that the Australian economy is growing strongly in the electorate of Moreton, no doubt due, in part, to his strong work on behalf of the constituents. The labour force figures for September released this morning show that seasonally adjusted unemployment fell again to 6.3 per cent - the lowest for the decade since the Labor Party's recession in the early 1990s. Full-time employment increased by 9,700; part-time employment fell by 40,200. This followed two very strong months of growth in July and August where employment rose by 100,000. Averaging out over the quarter, that is, for July, August and September, employment increased by around 23,000 jobs per month, similar to the average employment growth in 1999-2000.What that means is that, since the government was elected in March 1996, nearly 800,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy - in fact, I should have said `more than 800,000 new jobs have been a created in the Australian economy since the government was elected in March 1996' - and nearly a quarter of these jobs, 248,000, were created last year. In addition, the good news in relation to teenage unemployment is that the teenage unemployment rate fell to 19.6 per cent in September. That is the lowest teenage unemployment rate since August 1990, below the peak of 34.8 per cent under the Labor Party in July 1992. Under the Labor government, the peak of teenage unemployment in July 1992 was 34.8 per cent; today it is 19.6 per cent. - The Prime Minister asks who the minister for employment was in July 1992.  - Mr Speaker, forgive me for naming the Leader of the Opposition, who was the minister for employment in July of 1992. They are some of the results that you get from running a strong economy - an economy which for 13 quarters has grown above four per cent - on low inflation, a new tax system, improved industrial relations, low interest rates and structural reform. It is my belief that, if the Australian economy continues to grow at around this level of four per cent, we will not only achieve the budget forecast of 6 per cent unemployment by June next year but actually do better than that. We could do better than that if the economy were to grow at four per cent. But it will not grow unless the government continues to maintain its determination in relation to economic reform, fiscal policy, tax reform and structural reform. Fortunately, to date, the Labor Party has been unsuccessful in blocking the reforms which have created jobs. The good news for young Australians in particular is that their chance of getting a job under a coalition government is much greater than it ever was under the Labor Party, and as a result they have brighter futures. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. He, like all members on this side and anybody interested in the welfare of regional and rural Australians and, indeed, of people in metropolitan areas, welcomes the Besley report as a very constructive and even necessary advancement on debate on the way forward for communications. We have been very open and forthright in our communications policy. We do not duck and weave and deceive and mislead, unlike the Labor Party, whose only plan in this area is to send out the members for Perth and Melbourne to swan around boardrooms at merchants banks, testing the water. Instead, we do the hard work; we have the policies. On coming to government, we introduced the customer service guarantee, we strengthened the universal service obligation and we put aside $2 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra to upgrade regional and rural telecommunication networks. The Labor Party has totally abandoned the interests of Australians, like it has in so many other policy areas.The findings of the inquiry are very clear. Firstly, as has been said already, Australia generally has a world-class telecommunication system; secondly, people in metropolitan and regional centres have good services and are generally satisfied with them; but, thirdly, there is a significant proportion of people in rural and remote Australia who do not enjoy some key service aspects; they are simply not adequate at this stage. That is why we wanted the Besley inquiry to fully and comprehensively consult with people in regional and rural areas, so we could identify the problems and address them. We do not bury our heads in the sand, unlike the Labor Party, which completely and utterly abrogates responsibility for constructive public policy. The inquiry highlighted three specific problems for rural and remote consumers: firstly, there is poor performance in repairing faults; secondly, many small businesses and families cannot get reasonable access to the Internet, or no access at all; and, thirdly, a number of businesses or companies in rural and remote areas do not get the same telecommunications services, which they need to operate competitively, as businesses in metropolitan areas get. Those of us who represent regional areas know this to be the case, and we are glad our constituents were able to air their issues and grievances. Over the life of this government - 4½ years - we have invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars to address these issues and now we will address them further. The government recognises the importance of fixing these issues, unlike the Labor Party. We are developing a plan to address the issues as part of our final response, and we are not going to introduce legislation to privatise Telstra until that plan is developed and made public and until the problems of regional and remote consumers and communities are addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There have been a couple of major announcements in regard to telecommunications. We have addressed the first this afternoon - that is, the Besley inquiry or the Telecommunications Service Inquiry. But there was another announcement yesterday, which was that the Leader of the Opposition was a participant in the offer of Telstra for sale to BHP. In September 1995 the Leader of the Opposition was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, and he joined with the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in offering to John Prescott the sale of Telstra. It is inconceivable that as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance he was not prepared for that meeting, that he was not a full participant in that offer of sale of Telstra to BHP.  -  - Yes, it has slipped the memory of some people, but I would like to remind the House that in September 1995 the current Leader of the Opposition -  - The great privateer; he is a privatiser par excellence; of that there is no doubt. Is he going to deny that, before the meeting with Paul Keating and John Prescott, he was not aware of the content of that meeting? Is he going to deny that he did not know beforehand? Incidentally, did he tell Paul Keating he did not agree with the offer of the sale of Telstra? Of course not. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to sell Telstra in September 1995, as he will on return to government if ever that event should occur. So he was in attendance, he was briefed for the meeting and he was part of the offer to BHP for the sale of Telstra. Did he rush out of the room and warn his cabinet colleagues that Paul Keating had sneaked around the back door to sell off Telstra? Did he alert his caucus? Of course not, because he was part of the offer of the sale of Telstra. Did he disapprove of the offer of the sale of Telstra at that meeting? Of course not, because he was part of the offer. He either tacitly or expressly, and I believe expressly, approved the offer of the sale of Telstra then - just as he tacitly or expressly, and I believe expressly, has authorised the member for Melbourne to test out his theories because, after all, he told us in early 1999, when the member for Melbourne's book was released: We would, in any ground up review, be looking at a whole range of ideas on that - that is, the member for Melbourne's proposals - and other matters. So the member for Melbourne's idea of breaking up and selling off Telstra was endorsed at the time by the Leader of the Opposition, and now we find 18 months later that he is seeking advice from professional bankers. The Leader of the Opposition told his party, told the world, that he would surf into government on the wave of the GST. He was lazy, opportunistic and deceitful at the time, and now he also is in regard to Telstra. The Australian people will not stand for it. After all, it was the Leader of the Opposition, at a doorstop interview coming into parliament, before he had even seen the Besley inquiry, who said this: `Irrespective of their findings, we do not believe it justifies further privatisation of Telstra.' He said `irrespective of their findings'; he was not the slightest bit interested in constructively and sensibly looking at the issue. He is utterly opportunistic on this, as on all other policy issues.</DOC>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made reference in his question to an article in the Herald Sun this morning which quoted someone at Telstra or some records of Telstra in respect of suggestions that something should have been referred to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's office. I made inquiries of the Department of Finance and Administration this morning to see if they could shed any light on that particular story. They have absolutely no record whatsoever of those matters that were referred to -   - Mr Speaker, as I indicated, there is certainly no record whatsoever in the Department of Finance and Administration of the matters that were raised in that article this morning. - Mr Speaker, I have indicated that to the House because, as all honourable members know, the members' and senators' telephone accounts are sent to my department and subsequently paid. The article referred to certain matters which could well have been, from the way in which the article was written, within the records of Telstra. I am happy to take that on notice and to make appropriate inquiries. It is a public company. I cannot say whether or not that sort of information would be made available by that public company, but I am happy to make inquiries and to inform the House appropriately when those inquiries have been made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I am aware of a very insightful and independent analysis of the government school funding reforms that appeared on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today. This analysis was possible because the government, unlike the Labor Party, has been utterly transparent in relation to its funding policy. I commend this analysis to members of the opposition because it utterly refutes what they have been trying to imply in this House over recent days. Let me quote from this analysis. In terms of the amount being paid per pupil, which of course is the relevant factor, the schools doing best are nearly all smaller ones in Aboriginal communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Small Christian and Islamic schools, many with fewer than 100 pupils, are also well represented among those receiving up to $5,700 per pupil. Twenty-one schools in New South Wales can expect federal payments - that is, total payments - of more than $4 million in 2004. Most of them are Catholic secondary schools with many pupils, and are typically run by religious orders. - The member for Dobell never learns. - He never learns; nobody believes him. While the focus in the public debate has been on better endowed establishments, the schools which will receive the most are big ones, typically in lower socioeconomic postcode areas. You could not get a clearer endorsement, a more thumping endorsement, of the government's policy. That is the consequence of it, that those lower income communities will benefit most. Schools such as Central Coast Grammar in the electorate of Dobell, which the Labor Party froze in its funding levels since 1993 -  - will be entitled to an estimated increase of $1,571 for each of its over 1,000 students -  - or an extra -  - Mr Speaker -  - I regret the member for Dobell's departure, because I intended to put some facts before him about schools in his own electorate. Central Coast Grammar School, whose funding was frozen by the Labor Party, will receive an extra $1.8 million in 2004 as a result of the government's policies. The Wyong Christian Community School, also in Dobell, will be entitled to an extra $505 for every student, an overall increase of $73,000.The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dobell should tell parents at these schools why they froze their funding for so many years, despite the fact that these were middle and lower income parents who deserved more assistance, and why the Labor Party is now attacking the government's policy to put a fair funding principle in place for non-government schools. The Labor Party's political posturing on this shows up the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition, because the Labor Party has still not declared a position on this legislation. No-one knows - with just over 10 weeks to go of the school funding year, with school funding running out on 31 December - what the Labor Party's policy is. The reason no-one knows that is that the Leader of the Opposition has no capacity whatever to offer policy leadership. He does not seem to have any capacity to set policy in this area, and it may be that he will leave to his senators the decision as to whether or not they will amend or oppose this legislation - because he has no statement whatever on the public record. The government's policies are fair. This independent analysis has demonstrated them to be fair. It is time for the Labor Party to decide to pass this legislation. </DOC>

 - I would firstly make this comment: there was an article in the Herald Sun this morning. It may well be speculative; it may well not have any substance in it. The Department of Finance and Administration pays every member's and senator's bill. I would deem that that suggests that the department is the customer. The department has absolutely no knowledge of the statements that were made in that article on any file notes.On the second part of the question, I have no idea what matters the police investigated - and nor should I; nor should anyone. They will conduct their investigations as they deem fit and will deal with such matters in any investigation they are conducting as they consider appropriate. It is certainly not for me to determine what information or otherwise they should encompass in the course of any of their investigations. As I have already said to the House, I will make appropriate inquiries and, if there is anything to be added, I am more than happy to provide further information once those inquiries have been made. But, until they are made, I will not indicate how I may respond.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. As she knows, on 1 July this year the government introduced a new tax system, one of the largest structural changes to Australia since World War II and certainly our largest ever tax shake-up. That involved the abolition of wholesale sales tax, the introduction of a goods and services tax, a reform of business tax, including cuts to company tax and capital gains tax, and the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. From previous quarters, the consumer price index in Australia is at about three per cent, running at about 0.8 per cent per quarter. The government has estimated that in the September quarter figures, due out on the 25th of this month, there would be a one-off price effect from the tax changes of about 3 - giving for the quarter a figure which would therefore be in the high fours. In subsequent quarters, with the flow-through of the tax changes which will be detracting from the consumer price index, the tax effect would be detracting from the normal ongoing rate of about 0.8 and, in subsequent quarters such as the December and the March quarters, we should expect very low quarterly figures, because the effect of the new tax system will actually be a negative - that is, it will take off the ongoing inflation rate. Both the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia have indicated that they will be looking through the one-off tax effect caused by the new tax system in assessing monetary policy in the light of ongoing inflation - which, as I have indicated, by the consumer price index test, is about three per cent, which is consistent with the government's targeting of two per cent to three per cent on average over the cycle.Taking the CPI for the three previous quarters of June, March and December, already showing 2.3 per cent for those three quarters, and adding the CPI for September - which would, as I said, be in the fours - you would expect an outcome in through-the-year terms in the high sixes, adding that September quarter to those results that we have already had. Again, I point out that the effect of the tax system is thereafter to detract and, as those quarters flow through, we would get back - as it washes through the system - to the ongoing rate converging again with the CPI at about three per cent.The important thing to remember about the new taxation system is that, because the government has introduced a broad based goods and services tax, you do have this one-off price effect. Because income tax cuts outweigh the price increases, there is no basis for wage increases as a result of the price effects. Therefore, the price effects should not feed back into ongoing inflation, and we should be abstracting and looking at ongoing inflation in the targeting of our monetary policy.It is important that that message is understood clearly by wage earners - that, on the basis of one-off price effects, wage increases are not sought. It is important that employers understand that point as well - that employees have already had the most significant income tax cuts in Australian history. That is, the money they take home after tax is much greater, it already outweighs the one-off price effect of the new tax system and there is no basis, on the basis of those changes, to be seeking wage increases and feeding back a so-called second round. The important thing is that the first round be a one-off and that we keep economic management on the strong path that it has been on over the last three and four years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for that question. I recognise his keen interest in land issues, representing the very large percentage of the state of New South Wales that he does. The reality is that no government in Australian history has done more to address land degradation issues than the coalition government. The Natural Heritage Trust is the biggest environmental program in our nation's history - $1½ billion to lever community action groups right across the nation to implement literally thousands of individual programs in every community, in every electorate of Australia. Something like 9,000 projects have now been funded through the trust, and next week there will be an announcement of the next round of grants to local community organisations for a range of new activities in this particular field.It is interesting to note that the Labor Party voted against the Natural Heritage Trust. It was not in favour of a $1.5 billion action program to address land degradation issues across the nation. This program, which has mobilised community groups across the nation, Labor is against; it does not want this program. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has even described it as a `failure'. He has described as a `failure' that there are thousands of Landcare groups across the nation, thousands of community action organisations planting trees, getting on with the job of addressing environmental problems across the nation. The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards the NHT and the activities of the Landcare organisations and the like is a very clear warning to those groups that, if ever Labor were to be in charge of these issues, there would be no funding for local Landcare projects, the coordinators could expect their jobs to go -  - It is obvious that the member is sensitive, because his Landcare groups and his organisations know that their activities are being greatly boosted by the activities of this government and the Natural Heritage Trust - a program that the Leader of the Opposition considers to be a failure. Instead of it being a failure, it has indeed motivated groups across the nation and enhanced the activities of organisations everywhere who want to address the environmental problems of our nation. The NHT has been a classic example of some of the programs that this government has put in place to support land care but, most particularly, to mobilise community activities and the strong community sentiment about addressing salinity and water quality issues.Earlier this week the Prime Minister announced the $1.4 billion national action plan to deal with salinity and water quality - another example of the government demonstrating leadership. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the opposition's view that the things we are doing about the environment are a failure, the government's announcement in relation to this initiative has been warmly welcomed by community organisations - and quite a wide range of groups, I might add. The World Wildlife Fund for Nature, not always an organisation that backs the government, said: WWF Australia has welcomed the Federal Government's new action plan on salinity and water quality as a significant step forward in developing a rational, strategic and coordinated approach to two of Australia's most pressing environmental concerns.The Conservation Council of Western Australia welcomed the package and said:The package will provide an important focus for improving and coordinating the country's efforts into dealing with one of our largest environmental problems ... The Conservation Council of South Australia also welcomed it and said:The PM's model, announced today, has the markings of a real solution.The National Farmers Federation said that it welcomed the plan and called on the states, including the Labor states, to support the action plan at next month's COAG meeting. It said:NFF applauds the Prime Minister's leadership on the issue.The reality is that the community wants to work with the government to address environmental issues. It is a pity that Labor considers such initiatives to be a failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. - I do recall telling the House yesterday that there was an investigation and there were inquiries conducted over a number of months by officers in my department. As to the second part of the question, I am not aware of anyone in the Department of Finance and Administration discussing the matter with anyone in the Prime Minister's office - Opposition members - Department! - In the Prime Minister's department. I am not aware of that. I am happy to make further inquiries and, if appropriate, to give further information to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. Could I acknowledge the wonderful contribution that the member for Gilmore makes to the betterment of a lot of young people in her electorate through her support for a whole range of local initiatives. Members of the National Youth Roundtable constitute the government's principal advisory body in youth affairs. Members of the National Youth Roundtable 2000 have been meeting in Canberra this week, and they have been able to speak on behalf of the tremendous range and diversity of young people in Australia. I think that anybody who meets with members of the roundtable recognises that in the roundtable we have the most authentic voice of youth in Australia that this country has seen. It is extraordinarily representative, and it is a group which shows the great goodwill and capacity for hard work and dedication to their communities of young Australians. I want to thank members on both sides of the House for their willingness to meet with members of the roundtable and to participate in sessions of the roundtable. They will have found roundtable members very responsive to the questions that members asked them. Members have been involved in meetings with senior cabinet ministers throughout this week, and on Tuesday roundtable members held a most successful meeting with the Prime Minister. Yesterday afternoon they presented their findings and recommendations to an audience of ministers, members of parliament and senators from all political parties and representatives of youth organisations and Commonwealth departments. One of the common themes running through the recommendations of the Youth Roundtable was the great importance of attempting to solve problems in communities at the community level, and the members of the roundtable dignified themselves by coming to Canberra and not just asking for the government to solve these problems but saying that young people themselves were willing to be partners in the solutions to these problems. They believed that, through techniques such as peer education in the support for the more disadvantaged young people in their community and for young people contemplating suicide, young people themselves could be immensely beneficial in offering support.Members were all impressed by the quality of the projects. There is really only one negative that I want to comment on, and that is that I think the opposition still has a problem with its spokesperson for youth affairs, Senator Kate Lundy. Senator Lundy makes a practice of attacking the National Youth Roundtable in public while telling its members in private that she supports the roundtable. I can assure her, and I give this friendly advice to the Leader of the Opposition -  - This double standard is not doing the Labor Party any good. The members of the Youth Roundtable are not impressed -  -  - while there is evidence of double standards from the opposition, and they would like to see the private position of the Labor Party's Senator Lundy expressed more fulsomely in public.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is no. As to the question of whether the investigation that I requested when I heard about this matter in May should have been announced, I have been informed that it is customary practice - for the most obvious of reasons, and that is that you do not prejudice inquiries by announcing that they are taking place - when police inquiries of this type are launched that you do not automatically announce the fact that they are being launched. Obviously, in relation to that part of the question which I think is hypothetical, but I will nonetheless answer it, as to what might have happened, clearly if the police had recommended prosecution then certain consequences would have followed from that. As the honourable member is aware, the matter is now in relation to civil liability being considered by the Solicitor-General. At every stage after I became aware of this matter in May, I acted speedily and properly, as I should. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi and acknowledge he is a former national serviceman and also a reserve officer. He has maintained a very strong link with the ADF and I acknowledge his great service to our country through those areas. The government is very strongly committed to maintaining but also enhancing the reserves as a key component of the Australian Defence Force and, at the same time, providing necessary and adequate levels of protection to reservists and, importantly, their employers.The incentives that we have brought forward were developed after very widespread consultation with a range of interest groups, including peak industry bodies and union organisations. On Monday of next week, I will be attending in Tasmania the inaugural meeting of the restructured, and also enhanced, national Defence Reserves Support Council. The restructuring of this council has broadened the scope for community consultation, which includes not only employer groups, business groups and trade union groups but also youth representatives, the ethnic community councils and the media and education sectors. So it is going to be a much broader council, representative of the more modern community that has an interest in service to our country through a reserve force.This government has enhanced the national Defence Reserves Support Council through this new initiative, and we will be bringing three other very important initiatives forward in legislation shortly. It will protect the jobs of those in the reserve who are employed. This will make it easier for them to train and will also encourage them to volunteer for full-time service. What has also been widely acknowledged and welcomed within the business community is that it will compensate employers through a package of financial incentives that will be introduced based on adult full-time average weekly earnings. It will also facilitate the civilian accreditation of defence training, and that will be to the long-term benefit of the reservists as well as their employers.We will also conduct a public awareness program to promote the benefits of reserve service. I look forward to members on both sides of this House supporting these initiatives because it is important that we promote these initiatives to support our reservists who are located right throughout our communities. The government provided $20 million in this year's budget to support these initiatives. Importantly, these initiatives will complement legislation planned for introduction in the near future which will allow reservists to be called out for operations including peace enforcement, peacekeeping, humanitarian as well as disaster aid and relief operations. I also want to acknowledge that the current situation whereby most of the Australian Defence Force's operational needs for reservists are being met by voluntary employment is working well. We will continue to encourage this aspect of reserve service. Also, these initiatives reflect that the government really is taking a substantial step forward and a lot of action in this area to improve reserves proficiency so that they can better integrate with the regular force at short notice. Also, that will assist in the long-term viability of future service within the Australian Defence Force.  I am not surprised that we have received widespread support from a whole range of community groups, including the business community. We have had support from the self-employed, because these benefits go through to the self-employed reservists, and we have received very strong support from ex-service community organisations. I am certainly looking forward to support for these initiatives from the opposition, because I would like to think that we can get support from the opposition as we bring these measures forward to the parliament to enhance the role of the reservists in the Australian Defence Force.</DOC>

 - The question seeks a legal opinion but, despite that, I am perfectly happy to reply to the question and simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that we sought the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I would rather believe him than you. The Director of Public Prosecutions has delivered a result, and the Solicitor-General's advice is being sought in relation to civil proceedings. I know the Leader of the Opposition felt that he had to ask that question in order to work himself up into mock indignation for a censure, so let's have it.</DOC>

 - What I said then was what I understood to be the case. In terms of the handling of the matter, when it was first brought to my attention in August 1999 I asked that there be a full departmental investigation. When the results of that investigation were provided to me in April this year, my response was that the matter should be fully investigated by the police, given the nature of what had transpired. I believe that was the right thing to do. It is a fact - and I have said it before in the House - that I made a mistake back in 1994. I had not appreciated - and according to the Solicitor-General it would not be reasonable for someone to assume the later events - what had happened. But, as soon as I was aware of what had happened, I acted appropriately to ensure that the matter was appropriately dealt with.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I think the House knows the interest he has in matters pertaining to the South Pacific. Honourable members will be aware that the Prime Minister was party yesterday to the Biketawa Declaration, which was agreed to by all of the forum leaders at their retreat at an island called Biketawa, in Kiribati, yesterday and Saturday. This is a major step by the South Pacific to protect democracy and good governance. This declaration originates from the first ever meeting of forum foreign ministers, which was held in Apia between 10 and 11 August. That meeting of foreign ministers was convened to discuss the Fijian and Solomon Islands crises and to explore whether the forum should take further action, or some action, should there be crises in the future. At that meeting, it was agreed to recommend to leaders a set of principles and actions that could form a regional response to crises.The Biketawa Declaration represents a milestone in forum relations by providing a mechanism through which it can call on members to uphold democratic principles and to take certain actions, including targeted measures, if a member state breaches those principles. Australia has taken a leading role in seeking a constructive international and regional response to recent challenges to regional stability. We worked hard through the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in particular, and bilaterally to press for an early restoration of democracy in Fiji. We have assisted the parties in the Solomon Islands to reach a cease-fire and, subsequently, the peace agreement signed in Townsville on 15 October. We are now preparing for the deployment of an international peace monitoring team to support the Townsville peace agreement.I think the Biketawa Declaration, which Australia has worked hard with other countries to get agreed by the leaders, is a very important step forward for the Pacific nations. It is the first time they have ever agreed to cooperate in this way, and I congratulate the leaders, including of course our own Prime Minister, on the success of the forum leaders meeting. </DOC>

 - I had hand-delivered to the relevant minister's office this morning a personal cheque for $46,757. In addition to that, an earlier amount of $950 was paid, making a total of $47,707. I am told by the Department of Finance and Administration that that represents the amount paid by the taxpayer, the complete cost for all calls from 18 January. They asked me what was a reasonable date. We had a discussion as to the commencement date. There is no doubt that, as from 18 January, I have paid for every phone call made from that day through to 30 August 1999, when this matter was brought to my attention, including 23 phone calls that were made by two members of staff. In terms of the amount paid by the taxpayer, that is every last cent I have paid - noting, I might say, that I have no civil liability for that but that I have accepted the political responsibility for every last dollar paid by the taxpayer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I can inform him that the September quarter consumer price index figures were released last Wednesday, showing that there was an increase in the CPI of 3.7 per cent, significantly less than the government forecast in the budget of 3¾ per cent. It appears that the one-off effect from the goods and services tax was somewhat less than three per cent, not the 3¾ per cent the government had forecast in the budget. Remember this: in forthcoming quarters, the one-off effect of the taxation change will actually be to reduce the consumer price index as savings from wholesale sales tax flow through, and, on 1 July next year, stamp duties on marketable securities and financial institutions duty will be abolished. After abstracting from those figures the effect of the new tax system, the CPI was about 3¼ per cent over the past year, of which about one per cent represents the effect of petrol, meaning that core, or underlying, inflation - core inflation is a measure which is used in other countries - was about 2¼ per cent. This is an extremely low figure; in fact it is down at the lower end of the government's target of two to three per cent. At this time of the cycle, that is a very good outcome indeed.The effect of the consumer price index was actually lower than forecast by the government. The government put in place, with income tax cuts and increases in family allowances, more than generous compensation for the expected price impact - and the price impact was less than forecast, meaning that families have actually got more generous compensation than even the government had been forecasting. This was of course disappointing to the ACTU and to its superannuated members in this House, who were expecting a higher figure and were gearing up for wage claims on the basis of it. No doubt there was some disappointment for the former ACTU presidents in this House.If the government was wrong about the one-off price impact, it was because it overstated the effect, not because it understated it. It demonstrated the complete falsity of the Labor Party campaign against tax reform. The Labor Party said persistently that the tax changes would increase all prices by 10 per cent. The effect - even before all of the tax cuts are taken into account - was in fact less than three per cent. That was the Labor Party's false campaign. We even had claims as late as 1 August 2000 from the Leader of the Opposition who stated, in Hobart, `People are now paying more for child care, more for education and more for health.'  One of the findings of the ABS on the consumer price index was that the cost of child care fell 15 per cent under the new tax system. The ABS takes into account not just the fact that child care is GST free and people got back all of their input tax credits, but rebates were extended to more people at a higher value. So the cost of child care became cheaper under the new taxation system. This point was made in the Sun-Herald on the weekend, in an article headed `Child-care costs down 15 per cent'. It states, `Families with young children in child care have been the biggest winners from the lower than expected inflation over the past three months.' If the Labor Party had had their way, families would not have got the benefit of cheaper child care. The Labor Party opposed tax reform. They went around claiming that prices would go up 10 per cent, and they are disappointed when prices come down, when the CPI is going up by less than three per cent. We are back here again in this House, and we wait again for the R word to be used in this week of sitting. The R word has not been uttered by the Leader of the Opposition since 20 July. He was going to surf into office opposing the GST, and what is his policy now? His policy now is to keep it. He was going to roll it back, and yet he cannot even utter the word `roll-back'. He cannot tell us what he is going to roll it back on, he cannot tell us when, he cannot tell us how much it is going to cost, he cannot tell us how much it is going to affect the CPI, he cannot tell us how he is going to pay for it and he cannot tell us what the income tax rates are going to be. We have come across some weak oppositions in our time, but this opposition have been completely populist and dishonest. They have been caught, they have no policy, and the best thing they could do is to apologise to the Australian people for the falsity that they put out in the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Victorian state government made some announcements last week about the establishment of a tribunal in Victoria in the area of workplace relations. This is an interesting move from a Labor government which in opposition supported the referral of workplace relations to the federal parliament. I presume they supported the referral back in 1996 because it made sense for a lot of Victorian businesses to reduce compliance costs, complexity and the like. The latest proposal from the Victorian government has been estimated by the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry to result in the loss of around 22,000 jobs. The Premier of Victoria disputes that figure, but he does not dispute the fact that there will be job losses as a result of the establishment of this new regulatory body in Victoria. In fact, the economic statement prepared for the Victorian government by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research reveals that 600 jobs will be lost in the short term and 1,900 jobs will be lost over a decade. Some might say, `Oh, these are a few jobs; nothing much to worry about.' I say that every job counts, and it seems to go against any commonsense for a state government to be introducing so-called reforms that are going to cost people jobs. We have had a lot of concerns expressed in the last few days about 500 jobs being lost with the Email manufacturing plant in Melbourne. Under this proposal from Mr Bracks four times as many jobs would be deliberately lost as a result of a government policy. The other interesting thing is that the person who prepared the impact statement for the Victorian government, which they released, not only said that there would be a loss of jobs but, furthermore, said:The legislation would lead to a shift to casual employment because the cost of permanent employment would increase while casual loading stayed the same.This is a pretty incredible outcome from a Labor Party policy. The Labor Party have been railing about the increase in casualisation and now we have a Labor government who, on the advice of their own expert, say that their policy will lead to an increase in casualisation. Under the previous federal administration, casualisation grew at the staggering rate of 7½ per cent between 1990 and 1996. Under the federal coalition's workplace relations reform, that growth has slowed significantly to 1.6 per cent. Last year the Leader of the Opposition said that he was going to have an inquiry into casualisation. You do not need an inquiry into casualisation. He ought to pick up the phone and say to Steve Bracks that introducing reforms of this sort, leading to further casualisation, is not in the best interests of the community. It is done only to serve a few union interests, and he ought to stand up to them for once.</DOC>

 - The short answer is no. Furthermore, let me restate to the House that the first time I knew of this irregular usage of my card was on 30 August 1999. That account had been paid for by the relevant department - the Department of Administrative Services and then the Department of Finance and Administration - over a period of approximately five years and there had been no reference to me. Furthermore, the reason that there was no reference to me was in fact -  - Or to my office. You asked me about me or anybody associated with me in terms of electorate staff or ministerial staff. I have not had that matter at any time brought to my attention, and obviously I was surprised when I was asked about it on 30 August as a result of a request from the Department of Finance and Administration, to the effect: was the minister still using the Telecard? We now know, as the Leader of the Opposition said when it was put to him on 11 October, that `the way Labor structured the system back in 1991 did make it harder to pick up fraudulent use of taxpayers' money': Well, it is difficult to discern what that particular item would be in your account. Senator Conroy was asked by Sally Loane on 2BL on the same day:So you would know each month what your individual telecard is racking up?He replied:You don't know the individual telecard. You know what your electorate office phonecard is and that includes a component of your telecard.The fact is that I knew nothing of this until August 1999.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest in creating opportunities for rural and regional Australia, much of which is experiencing what might be called the tough end of very real economic change.The Regional Solutions Program will provide $90 million over four years. It is a direct response, along with a range of other initiatives, to last year's Regional Australia Summit. It joins, for example, such initiatives as the $1.8 billion expenditure outlined in the areas of health, Agriculture - Advancing Australia and more equitable access to education, particularly in remote areas. Of course, since then there has been the salinity and water commitment of the government - a very full, detailed and comprehensive response to the needs that were outlined at that summit.The Regional Solutions Program recognises that one-size-fits-all programs coming out of Canberra - where Canberra pretends that it knows best - do not work. Regional communities want to share responsibility with government for their region's development. They want to be given the tools and the capacity to take forward their own drive and their own ideas and to develop their own futures. The program targets communities experiencing economic and social disadvantage, including particularly high levels of unemployment and inadequate services. It is designed to help such communities build capacity and to identify and implement development opportunities. It will complement other government programs such as the Rural Transaction Centres, Stronger Families and Communities, Networking the Nation, and of course the Regional Assistance Program. Communities can seek assistance in conjunction with these other programs if that best meets their needs.After careful analysis of a number of programs that have been put forward for other government initiatives that did not quite fit, we have announced five pilot programs, one of which is in fact in the electorate of the member who asked the question, the member for Ballarat, and that is $56,000 to the Creswick district newspaper to enlarge that community's newspaper's operations and distribution, including the establishment of Internet facilities. It is very important indeed that people in rural, regional and remote areas be given an opportunity to upskill their abilities in areas which are going to be critical to people accessing the new economy. I know that that has been very welcome. Other examples include $330,000 to the Border Highlands Rail to restore the nationally significant Wallangarra railway station as part of an attempt to build a tourism industry with much greater depth in that hard-pressed region.In the Atherton Tablelands, which has experienced enormous stress in recent years through the winding back, for example, of the tobacco industry and where farmers have been affected by that and a whole range of other problems, there is nearly $300,000 for that community to develop, through a community liaison officer, a whole new range of both domestic and export markets. There is $55,000 going to the Northern Territory Christian Schools Association to promote greater integration of education and community wellbeing at a remote community there, and there is $100,000 to conduct a Tweed Shire agricultural land viability study as people in that area cope with enormous change in land use management. There are a variety of programs from planning through to modest seed funding for capital infrastructure available under this very useful, flexible program which is designed to help communities meet their own needs and drive forward their own ideas and their own initiatives in partnership rather than being dictated to by Canberra. </DOC>

 - The answer to that, I believe, is quite straightforward. When the matter was referred to the police, they, literally within a few days, came to see me, and I sat down with the police and provided them with all of the information of which I was aware. I also later made arrangements through my son for him to have discussions with the police. Obviously, I have been aware of what my son said to the police and I am aware of what I have told the police. As to the police's investigations, that is a matter for them. What the police then provided to the DPP is entirely a matter for the police. I am aware of the information which I and my son have provided them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can give her three concrete examples of our commitment to better access to Medicare and primary health care services for people in rural Australia, all of which involve new initiatives of the government. The first is a commitment to severely reduce the incidence of Q fever in Australia. Q fever is a vaccine preventable illness that is common in Central Queensland and in northern New South Wales. We have been enormously successful in reducing the rate of childhood immunisation preventable illnesses. Now it is time to have a look at illnesses that affect adults. Q fever is particularly prevalent amongst meatworkers, those who deal in livestock, such as in the transport industry, or people who work on farms. It is a fairly benign illness in many people, but in a significant proportion there is chronic incapacitating lethargy for a period of five to 10 years, and in a small proportion of people there are cardiovascular complications that can cause death. We are proposing to screen 100,000 people in Central Queensland and northern New South Wales who are most at risk and offer them free vaccinations, if they indeed are not immunised. We suspect 60,000 or 70,000 people will be vaccinated over the next three years.  The second thing that is a concrete commitment to people in rural and remote Australia is our decision to increase the Medicare rebate for people who are termed OMPs - other medical practitioners. In 1992, when the General Practice Strategy was imple-mented by the previous government, it was decided to freeze rebates for people who were not vocationally recognised. This has not mattered in the cities because people have substantial choice, but it has been a big issue in country Australia because a significant number of overseas doctors come in and are not able to get access to the vocational register. In a country town where there is no competition, the $5.10 difference between the vocational recognised rebate and the non-vocational recognised rebate comes straight out of the patient's pocket. As soon as we can get regulations through the parliament and make changes to the Health Insurance Commission's computers, which I expect would be in January next year, we will pay all doctors, all GPs, practising in RRMAs 4 to 7 - that is, small rural towns and remote Australia - the full rebate. This is something that the honourable member for Dawson knows was raised with me when I was in her electorate earlier this year. Many members, particularly from Western Australia, have been agitating for this for some time. The third thing that the government has decided to do is to financially support the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. We are going to give them $3.4 million over the next 18 months to develop standards for rural general practice, to look at issues around continuing medical education and support for rural doctors.The honourable member also asked whether I am aware of recent comments regarding access to Medicare. There are some very recent comments in today's Financial Review from the member for Werriwa. He proposes that consumers would be able to choose from a range of insurance options. They could either stay with the government insurer and their existing Medicare coverage or they could choose a non-government insurer. This is an opt-out proposal that is well known to the opposition. In fact, on 7 April this year, the shadow minister for health put out a press release on just this issue. She said:The universality of Medicare is its strength because it delivers all Australians access to care based on their health needs not their capacity to pay ...Medicare is the most efficient health insurance system and proposals to means test access to public hospitals or to allow the privately insured to opt out of the Medicare levy relegate Medicare to a safety net program for the `poor'.Here we have the member for Werriwa proposing that Medicare become a safety net proposal for the poor - in the words of the member for Jagajaga. To make matters worse, the member for Werriwa proposes to fund this by abolishing the 30 per cent rebate. He states that it would be financed from existing health outlays, including the 30 per cent rebate. Honourable members might ask themselves: how can a prominent member of Labor's backbench so blatantly go against the policy that the Leader of the Opposition has articulated? It is very simple. He is filling a void left by the member for Jagajaga who, even now, has failed to publicly support the Leader of the Opposition in his position on the 30 per cent rebate. During a recent interview in Queensland on the ABC the member for Jagajaga was asked by the presenter:The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, has been talking very much about windfall gains from the GST and reinvesting in infrastructure and in social programs, the bigger social program is the public health system.The member for Jagajaga could only answer, `Really?' The fact is that she does not have a clue what her leader is talking about in health care. She is not engaged in the health care debate. The member for Werriwa is being used as a stalking horse to have a system that will allow people to opt out of Medicare and create a two-tier health system, Medicare being for the poor.</DOC>

 - I have provided the House with the details of which I was aware and I have provided the police, obviously, with a full statement. In the intervening period the Solicitor-General, for the first time, provided me, and the public obviously, with the public release of his report, with a summary of the events which he believed had transpired. Based on what the Solicitor-General said, it is entirely consistent. I provided the police with the information which I was aware of. It was then a matter for the police to investigate, which was the point I have made in the House when I was asked about it. The police did investigate. The matter did go to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It then went to the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General made a statement. That contained a statement of the facts. If my memory serves me correctly, that was after the parliament had risen. That was on the Sunday, and I responded to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I am pleased to confirm media reports that the interim report of the WTO dispute panel that has been considering Australia's complaint against the US on restrictions on our lamb exports has found in Australia's favour. Members will recall the US decision that was taken by the administration over 12 months ago to apply a 32,000 tonne quota on Australian and New Zealand exports, of which Australia had a little over 17,000 tonnes. As part of that they applied a tariff of nine per cent in quota and 40 per cent out of quota. At the time, the government and industry expressed significant levels of outrage at this decision in that the administration's decision went way beyond the ITC report and recommendations. We always held that the decision was incorrect and inconsistent with WTO rules. We have been energetically prosecuting the case on behalf of the Australian industry within the WTO and this interim report is certainly very welcome. It was released on 24 October. Obviously there is a process to go through yet. The final report will become available on or about 14 December, at which time there will be a 60-day opportunity for appeal. I would imagine the US will probably appeal the decision. We will continue with the industry to prosecute the case in that regard.It is a clear indication that using the rules and disciplines within the WTO to the advantage of individual exporting industries is worth while and that we can use them and we can win. Without those rules and disciplines, we would be sitting here wearing the decision that the US made. The object of the exercise is to have the quota and the tariff removed as soon as possible, and before the three years is up. We will be working in that regard over the coming months to achieve that outcome. I have read in the media some comments about seeking compensation. There are no provisions within the WTO rules to claim compensation at this stage. If the WTO makes a final decision that the quota and the tariff must be removed, which we would expect at the beginning of next year, and then the US does not comply, we can apply for compensation. At this stage, there are not any provisions to do that. An important point is that middle-ranking economies like Australia can use the WTO rules to our advantage. We can help protect our unsubsidised exports of agricultural products to go onto the world stage and compete and win - against the odds when we are competing not against industries in these countries but against the US treasury and the EU treasury in the level of subsidy that they provide. This will be a great victory for the Australian industry. It should give Australian exporters great heart, and of course the government is prepared to put a lot of resources into prosecuting substantiated cases like this on industry's behalf with the assistance of industry. </DOC>

 - I appreciate the question from the member for Makin.  - If the member for Kingston has a question he can stand up and ask it, but I notice he very rarely gets a question, and I can understand why. His period as adviser to Mr Willis was not a glorious one. The member for Makin is an active member, and I thank her for her question. The government is ensuring that a great deal of assistance is made available to businesses which are putting in their business activity statements. Over 4,000 workshops as well as field advisory visits and signpost offices are being made available to assist, and there will be a BAS help week from 1 November to 8 November in over 200 locations around Australia. During this week, the ATO will be offering free, practical advice and assistance to small businesses who tried -  - Mr Speaker, there is a member that interjects. I hardly recognised him. He looks so much younger. I remind him as he interjects about the business activity statement that it was actually the Labor Party's policy to go to a PAYG system of taxation which required a business activity statement to be put in on a quarterly basis. It was actually part of the Labor Party's policy for a business activity statement on a quarterly basis because it was their policy to move to PAYG, something he may have actually overlooked in his youthful exuberance.There are 50,000 places available by appointment as part of the BAS help week. The ATO has already announced concessional lodgment and payment dates. The first BAS was due on 21 October, and the date for putting it in has been extended to 11 November 2000. Businesses will not be subject to late lodgment penalties where they have made a genuine attempt to comply. I want to reiterate that point for small businesses: they will not be subject to late lodgment penalties where they have made a genuine attempt to comply. For small business, I say: do not be put off by the form; make a genuine attempt to comply.The Australian Taxation Office has also advised agents that no general interest charge or late lodgment penalty will apply to clients who lodge by 30 November as long as the agents lodge in the vicinity of 50 per cent of their activity statements by 11 November. That is a point for agents themselves: there will be no general interest charge for their clients if they lodge by 30 November as long as they get 50 per cent of their clients in by 11 November. That is also something to reiterate for the tax agents themselves.In terms of reporting, businesses can choose one of two methods. They can choose the GST calculation sheet or the `GST derived from accounts' option. The accounts method, which allows you to take it off your own accounts, may be easier and quicker for those businesses who separately record GST amounts for supplies and acquisitions they make. They do not need to complete all of the calculation boxes on the BAS. I make that point too: you do not actually have to have all of the boxes calculated if you use the `GST derived from accounts' option. So there is a pretty intensive advertising campaign going on at the moment trying to encourage small businesses not to be afraid of the BAS. We acknowledge that the first one will be the hardest one. There will be some complexity because it is just a new system. But, once the first one has been done and businesses understand that it is a unified reporting system for PAYG and GST, they can also do it in relation to fringe benefits tax and the prescribed payment system. As we collapse 11 payment systems into one this will be a very worthwhile reform. The government would encourage businesses to come to grips with that form as soon as possible. As I have said earlier, there are a number of avenues of help for businesses who need further assistance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am very pleased to inform the House that last week I determined that two state based native title regimes complied with the federal Native Title Act: the first relates to New South Wales, the second to Western Australia. I note that both states have governments of different political persuasions. They are, incidentally, states where Labor has supported the concept of a state based native title regime. Indeed, the opposition leader in Western Australia, Dr Gallop, has described the WA regime as `balanced and fair'. The New South Wales regimes exempt the activities of low impact exploration for minerals and petroleum from the right to negotiate. This approach is designed to complement the Native Title Act, and it comes after extensive consultation. Mining is a major industry in New South Wales, employing more than 20,000 people, mostly in rural and non-metropolitan areas, and is a major export industry for the state. The determinations will assist the ongoing viability of mineral and petroleum exploration in New South Wales for the wellbeing of both indigenous and non-indigenous people.The second determination, relating to Western Australia, introduces an alternative state provisions regime. If the determination successfully passes through the Senate, it will mean that certain mining tenements and compulsory acquisitions on pastoral leases and on reserved land will not be subject to the federal right to negotiate. Instead, they will be subject to special procedural requirements set down in the Western Australian legislation designed to suit Western Australian conditions. I made that determination after lengthy discussions with the WA government and after giving careful consideration to representations made on behalf of Aboriginal representative bodies. The determination provides certainty and efficiency for all Western Australians and provides proper recognition for those who hold native title. The resource sector is a key industry in Western Australia, and for Australia as well, earning large export dollars and providing jobs for indigenous and non-indigenous people. The determinations will be tabled in the parliament shortly and will be subject to the disallowance process. Labor has already demonstrated that it has one native title policy for Labor states and another for the rest. Labor has allowed a piecemeal native title regime in Queensland to stand and a separate regime in New South Wales to pass the disallowance process, but Labor knocked back the Northern Territory coalition government's regime. Labor has indicated it will support the New South Wales determinations but not support the WA determination. I call on Labor to put politics aside and to allow the determinations to stand, so that we can have certainty in jobs in the mining industry Australia-wide, and not just in states with Labor governments.</DOC>

 - I never had any discussions with the Special Minister of State on the question of whether the matter should be referred to the Prime Minister. The only conversation I did have with the Special Minister of State was on 22 February. On 22 February I had not heard any developments in respect of the particular matter that was raised with me on 30 August 1999. I had a member of my staff ring his office to say that I wanted to speak to him. I spoke to him on the evening of 22 February. Essentially, the course of the conversation was to the effect that I had raised the matter with his department and sought an investigation back in August 1999. He said he was aware of that. I said it was well after Christmas and I was obviously concerned that the matter be investigated. He said that the matter was being properly investigated and that there was a proper process for the investigation of these matters. He said that there was an established departmental committee which had authority, subject to a process which had been ticked off by the Attorney-General's Department. I said that obviously the investigation was a matter for his responsibility and he said the matter was proceeding, that he was satisfied that the matter was being properly investigated at a high level and that all the proper processes were in place and had been fully observed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I can inform the House that the Dutch investment bank ABN AMRO, with assets of nearly $1,000 billion worldwide and more than 100,000 employees, have announced that they are moving their foreign exchange hub in Asia from Singapore to Australia. This announcement adds further momentum to our ambition to become a global financial centre. ABN AMRO are the fourth largest bank in the world for foreign exchange transactions. They will be running 15 Asian based operations out of Australia and these operations will cover all the major global currencies. This is a significant development because it clearly illustrates how new technology is giving Australia an advantage in becoming a global financial centre. It follows the announcement from Reuters just last Friday that their Asian customer support centres for Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore are to be centralised in Australia as part of a new customer support operation. In the case of ABN AMRO, they will be running their foreign exchange book for the American time zone out of Chicago, for the European time zone out of Amsterdam and for the Asian time zone out of Sydney. In the case of Reuters, they will be running their operations for Europe from London, for the United States from Chicago and in the case of Australia from Sydney. Those sorts of initiatives are only possible because of new technology. The greatest barrier Australia has faced in its ambition to become a global financial centre over the long years has been its distance from the rest of the world -  - and, as one of my colleagues says, the Labor Party. The key reasons why these major investors are coming here and why they are saying they want to employ more Australians are that the fundamentals that Australia offers are far greater than those of other places across Asia. We offer better IT. We offer better employees. We offer better language skills. We offer in many cases a more adaptable taxation regime. Above all of that, we offer a stronger economy. What that means is jobs - jobs from ABN AMRO, jobs from Reuters and jobs from all the other players that are determined to see Australia develop as a global financial centre.</DOC>

 - I have never had a conversation with the Special Minister of State about that particular minute. In fact I was not aware of its existence until it was made public in the Sydney Morning Herald in the last few days. Between 30 August 1999 and 8 May I have only ever had one conversation with the minister, and that was at my initiative because it was some months since the matter had been raised by my office and we had sought an investigation. I had heard no results of that investigation so I rang him simply to satisfy myself that the matter was being dealt with, and he reassured me to that effect. In respect of that minute, I have had absolutely no knowledge of that minute, let alone the suggestions contained within it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. He is one of many members on this side of the House who have a very deep interest in the affairs of the Pacific region. I can report that the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum was most successful and represented a very decisive assertion by the member states of the forum of the importance of acting in concert to deal with emerging challenges in the region. I express my thanks and appreciation to President Tito and the government and the people of Kiribati for the warmth and generosity of their welcome.The situations in the Solomon Islands and Fiji were clearly major issues at the forum meeting. I should report to the parliament the immense gratitude of the representative of the government of the Solomon Islands for the contribution made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs towards the very successful discussions concluded in Townsville on 15 October. The forum adopted what has become known as the Biketawa Declaration, which is a major step forward for the region. It recognises the need for member states to collaborate when difficulties and crises emerge and recognises that, as a last resort, the adoption of targeted measures could well be necessary.We naturally spent some time discussing the situation in Fiji. There have been some welcome statements of intention by the government of Fiji. However, it is fair to say that the jury is still out on how those intentions actually materialise. Because of that, the venue of the next forum meeting is as yet unresolved. I indicated to the meeting that, if the meeting were to take place in Suva, the government of Australia would have some difficulty in being represented at a prime ministerial level, and that is also the attitude being taken by the government of New Zealand.There was a lengthy discussion of the situation in West Papua and, against the background of recognising Indonesian sovereignty over West Papua, leaders expressed concern about the recent violence and loss of life and we urged both the Indonesian government and the secessionist groups to resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation. I briefed the leaders on the situation in East Timor and expressed thanks for the support so willingly given at the meeting in Palau last year for the INTERFET operation led by Australia.Finally, and importantly, I was able to demonstrate Australia's strong commitment to the Pacific Islands region in a number of other ways. I announced a 25-year extension of the Pacific Patrol Boat Program, at a cost of $350 million, from 2002 through to 2027. I offered to host a workshop on the control of small arms and Australian support for a regional paralympic group. I signed the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific. Finally, Mr Speaker - and this is something that will be of particular interest to you - on behalf of the parliament I presented a mace as a gift to the parliament of Kiribati, and a splendid mace it was indeed, reflecting great credit on the workmanship of Australians. It was a really beautiful representation of a traditional Kiribati weapon and it was very warmly and affectionately received by both the President and the Speaker of the Kiribati parliament. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I can inform the House that today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released data on international trade in goods and services for September. In seasonally adjusted terms, the balance on goods and services trade was a surplus of $677 million. This reflected an 18.6 per cent rise in exports and a one per cent rise in imports. The key factor driving the increase in exports in the month of September was $1.4 billion from the Sydney Olympics, which was a very welcome boost during the month to Australia's export income. Abstracting the Olympics - that is, taking the Olympics out of the figures - exports still increased 6.5 per cent in September and increased 25.4 per cent over the year. Abstracting the Olympics, exports still increased 25.4 per cent over the year. Non-rural and other goods exports increased 8.7 per cent in September, and rural goods exports increased 6.9 per cent to their highest monthly level on record. In trend terms - that is, abstracting from the one-off effects like the one-off effect for the Olympics - the deficit on goods and services trades fell $80 million to $834 million in September. That is the lowest trade deficit in trend terms for nearly 2½ years, consistent with a falling current account deficit.This indicates that Australia's economic growth is increasingly being boosted by export growth - that is, we came through the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, alone of the countries in this region, with a strong economy buttressed by a strong fiscal position, with demand strong in keeping the economy growing. Now, as the world comes back and the world economy increases in growth, Australia's growth, which is still strong by world standards - and we will be looking at our forecasts with the mid-year review shortly - will increasingly switch into exports. Exports will lead Australia's growth in the year 2000-01 and, on a strong economy, a falling current account deficit. Net exports are expected to make a significant positive contribution to GDP growth this year for the first time since the Asian financial and economic crisis. These are good news outcomes for the month of September, showing an improvement in Australia's trading position. I am sure all Australians will welcome the boost to exports.</DOC>

 - I have no doubt in saying that the Speaker of the Australian Parliament does believe me and finds me a very believable chap, if I may say so, just as we consider him one of the great Speakers of Australian Federation. And long may his glorious reign continue!  - I am sorry, Mr Speaker, you are not pulling me up for misrepresentation, I take it. Mr Speaker, notwithstanding all of the gems which fall from your lips on a regular basis, I am sure you would agree with the finding of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which recently looked at the change in excise and the GST which was put in place on 1 July. The first thing, of course, it found was that when the tax changes came in between 30 June and 1 July - that is, on a constant oil price, constant retail margins and constant profit and the like - prices actually fell. That is, prices actually fell in the major metropolitan areas with the introduction of the new tax system; they did not rise. In addition, in its report the ACCC constructed an index of the international price in petrol and found that, comparing actual prices in Australia with its international index, the price was 1.6c per litre lower in Australia than would have been expected by the movement of oil prices and other variables applying in the international index. It found that 1.6c per litre could well have been savings which were captured by the oil refiners and distributors in Australia. In addition, I make this point: all petrol which goes to the bowser is transported generally in diesel trucks which, from 1 July, had a 24c a litre reduction in fuel excise - that is, the transportation of petrol itself became cheaper.I would just refer to one other point, because I think members of the government would be interested in this. You may recall that the Labor Party had a Senate select committee to look at the impact of the new tax system when the Labor Party was trying to defeat tax reform and chain Australia to wholesales sales tax for the new century. In its main report, it made a finding not that the government's cuts in excise were too small but that they were too large. It criticised them for being too large. This was the Labor Party minority report of the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System of April 1999. Here is what it said in its conclusion:The government's proposed tax changes will encourage business to use the more heavily polluting petroleum fuels at the expense of LPG, LNG and other more environmentally friendly fuels.In other words, we were cutting excises which would encourage people to use diesel and petrol when the Labor Party thought that this would take them away from environmentally friendly fuels. It said:They will encourage private cars at the expense of public transport. The Labor Party was complaining in April 1999 that our cuts in excise would encourage too much use of private cars. It is a complete, recent invention that the Labor Party somehow is in favour of greater cuts in excise or GST. It said:They will encourage more heavy transport vehicles ... That is, because we cut 24c a litre, the Labor Party was attacking us for encouraging more heavy transports. And then - this is my favourite part - there was the Labor Party finding in April of 1999 when it quoted with approval the Australian Conservation Foundation as saying this:This tax reform package is the only example in recent years of an OECD country introducing a net reduction in fuel and energy related taxes and charges.That was the criticism - that we were the only OECD country in recent years which had introduced a net reduction in fuel and energy related taxes and charges. That Senate select committee, which was attacking the government in April 1999 as cutting taxes too much and as going it alone in the OECD, was chaired by Senator Peter Cook, who has now been put in charge of an inquiry to find out why we did not cut the taxes enough. The bloke who found we cut them too much is now in charge of the Labor Party's inquiry to try to find out why we should have cut them by more. Talk about recent invention.  - Oh, some mothers do have them. What would we do without the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. WTG, Mr Speaker, WTG. So there they go. They get Cookie out to say, before the package comes in, `Outrageous! You're encouraging diesel and petrol. You're going it alone in the OECD.' We bring in the reforms and then Cookie is put in control of saying, `You should have cut by more.' There is no policy coherency whatsoever in this populist rabble. It is an absolutely populist rabble who would not know a policy if they fell over one. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has listened and has acted. We have listened very carefully to the concerns of regional Australia, both in terms of what we glean when we move around rural and regional Australia and also in terms of what was put to us at the summit last year. We have been acting in comprehensive and decisive ways to meet the concerns wherever we can legitimately help make a real difference. I mention last Friday's very successful launch of the $90 million Regional Solutions Program. It is carefully designed to respond directly to requests from the summit for flexible partnership arrangements to help in areas of real disadvantage. It has been very, very widely welcomed by everybody - except, of course, the carping opposition spokesman in this area - including the NFF, who made a point of saying that it offered the prospect of making a very real difference to people in disadvantaged areas. There has also been the announcement of the $700 million national action plan for salinity and water quality. One of the issues that was consistently highlighted at the summit was the need to ensure a more rapid transition to greater sustainability in agricultural land use and production in this country. There has also been the announcement of the $240 million stronger families and communities strategy, again addressing a very real need, specifically identified at the summit. There has also been the $1.8 billion package announced in the last federal budget. In that was the $562 million `more doctors, better services' package, which has been referred to in this place by my good friend and colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care. That is a very valuable set of initiatives designed to address the policy failure by those opposite to ensure that we had sufficient quantity, in particular, of training in medicine for rural children, because they are the kids who, having completed their training, will go and practise in rural and regional Australia and make a difference. Under that program we have, for example, amongst many other initiatives, a new bonded scholarship scheme for medical students who agree to practise in rural areas. We have doubled the number of rural Australian medical undergraduate scholarships, giving country students access to the same opportunities. -  - We hear interjections from the other side, but we are addressing their policy failure in this most critical area of rural and regional Australians' health. There was the announcement just the other day of the extension of the full Medicare rebate to GP services provided by OMPs - other medical practitioners. There was the increased discount for farm and business assets from 50 per cent to 75 per cent under the youth allowance family assets test; increased funding for students who live away from home through the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme; the $309 million extension of Agriculture Advancing Australia, taking it to around an $800 million initiative; support for the Year of the Outback; and meeting our commitment to better coordinate state, local and federal government initiatives between the three spheres of government. There has been the expansion of the Community Development Employment Program. There has been the setting up of the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal, which has now announced its first round of funding initiatives. The most cursory and honest glance at what we have done in the last 12 months by those in rural and regional Australia reflects a rich and diversified response to the needs of rural and regional Australia. I was asked, in part of that question, was I aware of any alternative policies. Am I aware of any alternative policies? The fact is that we have heard of only one. We have not heard its name mentioned for a while, as the Treasurer has pointed out. It is `roll-back'. That is the only one we have heard of. When it comes to roll-back in rural and regional Australia we have a very real understanding of what it means, because we saw the greatest single roll-back of opportunity in rural and regional Australia in the history of the country under Labor in the eighties and the nineties - the greatest ever roll-back of opportunity ever seen in rural and regional Australia under this lot opposite. The fact is that their record is a disgraceful one. They sucked the lifeblood out of rural and regional Australia. You sucked the lifeblood out of the place with high interest rates, with high inflation and with - what has been referred to in this place today already - such approaches as a 500 per cent increase in fuel excise. Let us not forget that. There was a 500 per cent increase in fuel excise from these hypocrites opposite in the time that they were in power. That is what it was: 500 per cent.All we have opposite is a shadow spokesman who offers no alternative policy - nothing. We have seen no policy at all - none - from the member for Batman. We have seen no vision. We see no hope at all offered to rural and regional Australia. All we see is carping, misinformed and mean spirited criticism. That is all we get - absolute drivel from Labor's spokesman from the region. He cannot even match the New South Wales Premier. The New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, was actually able to say in February this year on the Howard Sattler program that, `We got working with the federal government.' He was talking about the regions. He said, `I give them part of the credit.' But could the member for Batman actually manage to acknowledge the value of anything we have done, let alone put up a policy proposal that might be positive in its own right? The answer is no.</DOC>

 - My recollection of the answer given on 15 August is that any authority in relation to the monitoring of petrol prices was somewhat more reliable than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have not read Mr McCrann's latest contribution, but I have read a lot of his contributions and I think the balance of his articles is probably not all that favourable to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - but we will put that aside. One item in the ACCC report struck me as particularly relevant to the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It says this: The Commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected -  - He says, `Oh yeah!' There is always this sort of smart alec introduction, never an acknowledgment that this is in fact a quote from a report of the ACCC, which was the basis of the question that he asked me. The reality is that the ACCC does not support your assertion. If you look at the ACCC report, what the ACCC had to say was this:The Commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected on the basis of movements in underlying factors, including historical wholesale and retail margins. This is not inconsistent with the suggestion that cost savings from the new tax system have been passed on.What that does is support what the government has been saying now for four months, and that is that you had a discretionary cut in excise of 6.7c a litre and then in addition to that you had cost savings of 1½c a litre. Here is the ACCC saying that its analysis is not inconsistent with that proposition. So far from supporting what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, it is quite the reverse. Once again, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is misleading the parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He is very actively involved in the debates about workplace relations and I thank him for his work on that. The October edition of the Reserve Bank Bulletin said it all when referring to labour market reform to the effect that the key development in the 1990s has been the gradual move away from centralised wage fixing arrangements to a more decentralised enterprise based focus. That has brought real benefits to workers, particularly low paid workers, who have seen a significant increase in their real wages, namely their wages after inflation. Credit where credit is due: the Labor Party themselves in the early 1990s were advocating a shift to an enterprise based system because it would be good for workers. It is a pity they do not still advocate that position when the benefits for workers are so obvious.Having made enterprise bargaining so central to the workplace relations system, the government is now, however, looking forward to see what further changes we can make to the system to make it even better in the future. Whilst we have not adopted any policy positions, I have on behalf of the government released some discussion papers looking at what might be a better system for both employers and employees in the future. Those papers canvass the option of moving to a national workplace relations system based on the corporations power instead of the existing conciliation and arbitration power. The BCA said:The current system is extraordinarily complex, highly litigious, process driven and is hampering attempts to harness productivity gains that would come from a smoothly functioned system.You would be hard-pressed to disagree with that simple statement. Relying on old solutions for future challenges is clearly not the way to go, and we do need to be looking at a better way. We have had 40,000 hits on the web site established to provide people with information and we have had other responses. For example, the Australian Industry Group says the papers are: ... welcome and constructive as an initiative. Further, it is immensely important to operate within a compatible and unifying workplace relations system. The Financial Review said:The proposals for a new industrial relations system deserve serious attention. Further, it said:What makes the issue more pressing now is that there have been significant changes to workplace relations over the past decade to focus more on enterprises rather than prescriptive industry-wide awards. But this process of change is being constrained by the primacy of conciliation and arbitration power.The Democrats' Senator Murray said that he sees merit in moving towards a single system. Even the Victorian Trades Hall Council, whilst not agreeing to just any unitary system, said that a single system will take interstate competitiveness out of the picture when issues such as company relocations are being discussed and it will also minimise much of what they say is the confusion about which system an employee should be in. Jeff Shaw, a recently retired Minister for Industrial Relations in New South Wales, says:There is a technocratic case that could be made for a unitary system, and in part that case depends on the notion that many industries are across state borders. They are not confined to intrastate enterprises, and that is why for many industries federal regulations are appropriate.That is an encouraging first response to what is a vital issue. From the government's perspective, I think the two discussion papers are a fair and comprehensive examination of the issues. We do intend putting out some more before Christmas. I encourage people to look at these with an open mind. There is no doubt that, if you were starting afresh today with a blank sheet of paper, no-one in their right mind would say that it would be a good idea to have one federal system and six or seven systems duplicating it. We do need to look constructively at the future, and this government is committed to do so, using these discussion papers as a basis.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is fair to say that in recent times the National Party has sought to highlight the importance of the public broadcaster in terms of its role as a provider of information to people in many parts of this country who do not, for example, have the luxury of being able to order a newspaper to be thrown over the back fence every morning. But, having said that, let me just make a couple of points. -  - No, I was not there last night. I was filling in for the Prime Minister, at a very important function with the Leader of the Opposition, as a matter of fact - the Paralympics function in Sydney last night. I am meeting with the aforesaid gentleman later this week and we will be making it quite plain - we will continue to - that we believe that the services offered by the ABC as part of its responsibilities, its charter, in rural and regional Australia are very important. I would make it quite plain that there are no grounds for them saying that they should be immune from having to do more with less. As I have said, in rural and regional areas we have been learning how to do that for a very long time with problems with commodity prices and declining terms of trade. The fact of the matter is that we had to make certain broad budgetary decisions, when we got into government, over the mess that we inherited from you and the ABC have had a responsibility to work within those guidelines. I believe it is very important that they seek not only to deliver quality programs but to do so in an efficient, timely and cost-effective way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question on this matter. The government has been guided very much in this area, in terms of the number of visas that will be granted to parents, by conducting a program of migration which is in the national interest and one which maintains public confidence. As a result, we allocated this year 500 places for aged parents and a further 750 for the disallowed but reinstated concessional class. Of course, we do recognise that that comes at a cost. It is a cost to taxpayers because aged parents are unlikely to add to the tax base but they still incur higher health and welfare benefit costs to the budget. It is estimated that, on average, each aged parent will incur about $6,000 a year in health costs and that more than half will make claims on our welfare system. It is further estimated that, on average, aged parents, after arrival in Australia, will live for a further 20 years. So, conservatively, it is estimated that each parent can incur costs of at least $200,000 over his or her lifetime. The government did try to address this matter by asking families to make a reasonable contribution to these lifetime costs. -  - But Labor, as is evident from the noise that we hear, rejected that plan. I have looked to see what other plans the Labor Party might have in relation to the entry of parents and what the implications might be for the budget and the forward estimates, because the Labor Party has two stories to tell on this matter - one that it tells the general electorate and the other that it thinks only a few people will hear or are listening to. Let me take firstly the member for Batman. The member for Batman, in a speech he gave which was published in the Australian Economic Review, expressed unease about the ageing population and its impact on health, aged care and retirement incomes. - He didn't. He was also concerned about the dependency ratio, that is, the ratio of working age to non-working age Australians. They are proper issues to be concerned about and, of course, if you have in mind that you want to change those ratios, you might well want to substantially increase the number of older people coming to Australia, with the consequent costs to the budget. It is important. I have asked the honourable member for Bowman if he would like to indicate what the Labor Party has in mind. I cannot get a figure out of the honourable member for Bowman. But I was interested recently, in reading the Sing Tao newspaper of 18 October, to find that the -  - Ni hao -  - Yes, and xie xie you will get too. Thank you very much for the opportunity but let me just say that I do have a translation to help honourable members in relation to this matter, because interestingly what it has to say is that if Labor comes to power the parent migration quota will increase to 6,000. The Sing Tao reports - and it may need a correction - that `the federal opposition leader, Simon Crean, said at the multicultural dinner held in Clayton that the Liberal Party's parent migration policy is `inhumane and unreasonable'. He affirms that the Labor Party will increase the quota to 6,000 a year if it comes to power after the next election. Opposition membersThat's wrong! - I would be happy to hear the correction. Let me say what the implications would be so that it is clear -  -  - The important point in relation to this is that, based on the figures I gave earlier, if you were to admit 6,000 people under those concessional arrangements, the lifetime costs would add $1.2 billion to the costs carried by taxpayers. If it were 6,000 a year, it would be $1.2 billion for the second year and $1.2 billion for the third year - the lifetime costs would be added. It is important that there is an open discussion of these matters. If the Labor Party has a policy on it, let's hear what it is; let's know what the numbers are. Let there be no walking both sides of the street. Do not assume that you can go to a function, speak to people and hold out hopes to them that there will be increases in the parent category and that the community generally will not be told of what the potential cost to the budget would be. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her for the outstanding initiatives to help young people which she has been supporting in her electorate. There are currently some 95,000 participants in New Apprenticeships in regional Australia. That is approximately twice the number there were when this government came to office. Over the last four years, some quarter of a million Australians have been helped through the New Apprenticeships system in rural and regional Australia.Last Monday I launched in Nowra the latest phase of the communication campaign about New Apprenticeships for regional Australia. We believe that the New Apprenticeships system has got a tremendous capacity to help young people and communities throughout this country, because New Apprenticeships give young people the opportunity to get training and skills in their community. They do not have to go away from the community to pick up world-class, nationally recognised skills that will be helpful to the businesses in those communities. Businesses in regional Australia are helped by the New Apprenticeships system because they can develop the skills in the community rather than having to buy those skills, perhaps at great cost, from one of the larger population centres. I make the point that New Apprenticeships provide unique opportunities for the 85,600 family owned commercial farms in Australia which have the capacity to participate in this scheme. The government would like to see more and more participation in the New Apprenticeships system throughout rural and regional Australia. It helps to build the social fabric of the local communities and the economies throughout the country.Contrast the government's achievements in this area with what the other side has offered. I am asked in this question whether there are any alternatives that I am aware of. The fact is that there are no alternatives. When it was in office, the Labor Party cut the heart out of the apprenticeship system. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was the lowest for three decades. It is quite clear that if the Labor Party came to power they would reinstate the trade union movement in control of the system, and it would have the same disastrous effect on opportunities for young people in the future as it had in the past when the Labor Party was in office. The Howard government is building real job opportunities for young people in rural Australia. It is helping businesses in rural Australia to be competitive and to improve their bottom line, and it is laying the foundations for much more prosperous and socially harmonious communities. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first question is: yes. I have done that checking, and the secretary of my department has confirmed that the department had no prior knowledge of the matter before May. The answer to the second question is: yes, it applies to my staff. My understanding is that the first my staff had any inkling of this matter was when a senior member said that Mr Reith was writing to me about an urgent matter and that he would seek to see me later that day. To the best of my recollection, that was 8 May.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for the question. The electorate of Groom has a very important pig industry which makes a significant contribution to the local economy. - As do quite a number of other electorates - that is true. Earlier today, the Treasurer reported on Australia's excellent trade performance in the past month. In his response, he mentioned the fact that agricultural exports reached an all-time record. That is a real tribute to Australian farmers who are developing a tremendous export culture. Included among those are Australian pork producers. The pork industry has grown significantly in its exports, particularly into the market of Singapore, which has grown from virtually nothing at the beginning of last year to exports of over $95 million in the last 12 months. In fact, we are currently sending about 2,000 tonnes of pork a month into that vital Singaporean market.Last week, I was in Singapore to launch the Singapore Market Alliance Program, which is designed to underpin the market penetration of Australian pork products and to guarantee that those arrangements are strengthened and maintained. I had the opportunity in Singapore to open a new boning plant which is a joint venture between Auspork and Oh Tau Tee Pigs, which will exclusively market or be involved in the supply of Australian pork into that vital market. The Singapore Market Alliance is jointly funded by the Australian government and the industry and will certainly help enhance the opportunities for chilled Australian pork into that very significant market. The Confederation of Australian Pork Exporters are working with the local industry to market Australian pork under the brand AIRPORK. Under that name, we will strengthen the image not only as a reliable product but as one which has been provided promptly in the holds of aircraft travelling between Australia and Singapore. The pork will indeed have flown very promptly from the Australian farm to the Singaporean markets and that is very attractive.  As a part of this initiative, not only are we going to underpin and promote the brand name AIRPORK but we are also going to encourage the development of the chilled chain to demonstrate that Australian pork is delivered as world-class product able to meet the demanding standards of the Singaporean market. This is another example of the success of an Australian farming industry and is a further illustration of the success of this government's $24 million pork industry development plan. This particular step is an example of what can be achieved when an industry develops a strong export focus and works cooperatively with the government and its markets to achieve long-term export performance.</DOC>

 - The remarks that I made in 1997 were against the background of arrangements that had been in place in relation to the payment of entitlements. As I always do in cases like this, I would want to check exactly what I said in 1997, but those remarks would have been made against that background. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the investigation by the Department of Finance and Administration in relation to the minister's telecard was being carried out against a set of protocols established by Senator Minchin when he was the Special Minister of State, which involved the establishment of an audit process and the establishment of a committee to ensure that, as is appropriate in cases like this, the investigation was kept, to the proper extent, at arm's length from ministerial involvement to ensure that there was a completely objective approach adopted.It remains the reality in this case that the minister came to see me in May after a number of discussions between him and the Department of Finance and Administration. This was against a background of not having been informed until late August the previous year of the misuse of the card - a proposition that has not been dented by anything that has been said over the past few weeks. I have said on a number of occasions, and I say it again, that nothing has transpired either in this place or elsewhere that has essentially dented the proposition that was put to me by the minister. He came to me in May. I sought the advice of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General advised that there should be a police investigation and, importantly, the Attorney-General advised that the question of payment of the money should wait until receipt of the police report.As soon as I knew of this matter, I facilitated the reference of the thing to the Australian Federal Police. I awaited the report, and we sought the advice of the Solicitor-General. The opposition will naturally ask questions on the matter - I fully expect that to be the case, and I welcome any questions they may ask - but the essential narrative that was given to me by the minister in May this year has not been dented by all the hectares of newsprint or all the questions or all the abuse that has been hurled at the minister by the opposition and others over past weeks. He has acknowledged the error that he made. He has paid the money in full. If there are any other questions the opposition has to ask, I will be very happy to answer them. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. Last week the inflation figure was released. It indicated that the impact of the GST on prices was certainly less than expected. This makes some comments by the Leader of the Opposition a littler earlier in the year look a little foolish. On 2GB in May the Leader of the Opposition stated, `The government has botched on the calculation of the price effects.' He went on to say at the Labor conference in Queensland in June - and these are the exact words: You will remember we said these things about John Howard's GST. The Howard government grossly underestimated price rises.The survey from the ACCC, released in conjunction with the evidence from the CPI last week, indicates that 45 per cent of all items surveyed by the ACCC fell in price after the introduction of the GST. This follows on from another comment from the Leader of the Opposition, who said, `I don't believe any prices are going to fall when the GST comes in.' Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition. The ACCC has found that there was no evidence of widespread opportunistic pricing intended to raise margins immediately after the GST changes. This makes a lie of all the allegations made by the Labor Party. It shows the Labor Party up for what it is: it is a fraud, as exemplified by the fact that we have not heard the word `roll-back' for some time now. What happened to the policy that was the basis for all the allegations made by the Labor Party in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in May 2000, `We believe that the budget still underestimates what the true inflation effect will be.' The inflation effect came in last week at less than anyone expected.No-one showed more contempt for the people of Australia than the opposition in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST. When we sent out eight million price guides from the ACCC, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described this as an embarrassment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was waving pyjamas in this place, the member for Wills was waving magazines and the member for Bass was waving a local newspaper. We all remember that. The Labor Party were shameful in their contempt for consumers in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST. The CPI figures that came out last week are proof positive that the best and most vigilant watchdogs are the consumers of Australia. Those consumers of Australia, with the support of the ACCC, will continue to watch the impact of the new tax system on prices. That will continue for a two-year period. Next year, on 1 July, with the abolition of financial institutions duty and the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares, prices will come down even further. That is good news for consumers. It proves that the Labor Party peddle lies. It shows them for what they are: they are people who hold the consumers of Australia in contempt.</DOC>

 - I believe that the procedures and approach adopted by Senator Ellison were proper. I have discussed the matter with Senator Ellison and I do not believe that the way in which he has handled the matter warrants any kind of reprimand. I am fascinated that this question should emanate from the Leader of the Opposition. I am reminded of a story written by somebody who does not always reflect favourably on me or the government - that is Mr Alan Ramsey, of the Sydney Morning Herald. He had this to say in relation to an issue that will be easily recalled by most members of the House. He starts by saying:In hindsight what a joke. From the moment the word police was mentioned, the matter was settled in three weeks. It was the bureaucrats who had wanted the police called in. It was the politicians who kept them out. Beazley and Evans, with the Government's apparent support, were responsible. Their Departments acquiesced only after the two ministers resolved the problem behind closed doors.That, of course, is a reference to the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition and the former Attorney-General in September 1983. The reality in this particular case is that, as soon as ministers knew of allegations of improper use of this card, investigative procedures were put in train. I repeat what I said in answer to earlier questions: nothing has been brought forward that dents in any way the proposition put to me by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business when he came to see me in May that, until August of the previous year, he did not know - nor, I am informed, did Senator Ellison know; nor, I am informed, did the Minister for Finance and Administration know - of the possible misuse of his card. As soon as we knew, a proper, transparent procedure was put in place under the mentioned protocols established in the Department of Finance and Administration. Far from the matter - in the words of Alan Ramsey - being resolved behind closed doors, as soon as it came to me it was sent to the Australian Federal Police and we sought the advice of the Solicitor-General. You did not send him to the Federal Police. You settled it behind closed doors. The Beazley-Evans protocol was to keep the police out. Our approach at all times has been, as soon as a suggestion was brought to ministers, to establish a proper procedure. When it came to me I sent it off to the Australian Federal Police. I got the advice of the first law officer. I got the advice of the Solicitor-General. If you want to look at deplorable standards for handling these issues, look at the standards of Beazley and Evans in 1983.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As a matter of fact, because of the lobbying and the concerns he has expressed on behalf of regional Victorians, I could hardly not be aware of the importance of Essendon Airport. He, like other Victorian country members, has constantly reminded me that Essendon is a key transport link between regional Victoria and its capital city. That airport is estimated to now handle around 18,000 regional aircraft movements a year. It is, amongst other things, the home of the Victorian air ambulance and the Victorian police air wing. I heard a Victorian Labor member, the member for Corio, a moment ago saying something to the effect that we ought to be sticking up for it. He might want to talk to the Victorian Labor government, because they have been saying they want to close Essendon. They have been saying they want to shut it down. They have not been showing any commitment to regional Victoria at all. It is we who have been standing up for it. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, we recognise that Essendon is a very important part of Victoria's transport infrastructure. It is also an important source of employment. The airport employs about 105 businesses, believe it or not, and it employs over 1,000 people. So, in the face of this, the government has decided that Essendon Airport will remain open as an operational airport. We will sell our shares in Essendon Airport Ltd. EAL, the company, has a 50-year lease over the airport, and the purchaser will be required to continue operating the site as an airport. So we have recognised that that airport is a vital part of Victoria's rural and regional transport linkages. We will ensure, at the same time as ensuring that the airport remains open, that residents in the area are protected from high noise levels. We have been prepared to do for regional Victoria what the Labor Party has not been prepared to do.</DOC>

 - The situation is that after that question time I was informed - and this has subsequently been confirmed - that there was a low level contact between Telstra and the Department of Finance and Administration. I think it was in July; I would have to check that. Apparently an officer of Telstra thought there was a discrepancy in that there had been a usage of the card in one part of the country and a very quick usage of the card in another part, and that seemed unlikely. Then a check was made, so I am informed, of the travel records of the minister, and the usage was consistent with what was revealed in the travel records. As a result, the matter was not taken any further and, as a result, the matter was not referred to the Minister for Finance and Administration, it was not referred to the Special Minister of State and it was not referred to the minister for workplace relations. Once again it is consistent with what I have been saying for about three weeks: nothing has emerged which has in any way dented the narrative that was given to me by the minister when he came to see me in May. I invite the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow - because we have now reached our 20 questions - if he has further particular matters he wants to ask me about, to go ahead and do so. I understand his interest in this and I am open to further questioning on it tomorrow. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for the question.  - There have been a number of calls made on the Commonwealth government to freeze the excise on petrol. Those calls have come from some state premiers and they have also come from motoring organisations, and I want to take a moment of the House's time to respond to the question asked by the member for Page. All of these calls are based upon the erroneous proposition that the Commonwealth's budget is already clearly in some net windfall position as compared with what was brought down in May of this year. That is not the case. It is true, as I have acknowledged on a number of occasions over the past several months, that the higher price for petrol caused by the almost doubling in US dollar terms of the price of crude oil means that there will be an increase in collections of resource rent tax, although I take the opportunity, based on the advice I have received from the federal Treasury, to reject the estimate put forward today by the Australian Automobile Association. - Moreover, if you are looking at the Commonwealth's net budget position, you have to take all of the outlays and revenues into account. You do not have, as organisations like the AAA have, the luxury of a narrow focus on one issue. You have to take into account all of the Commonwealth's expenditures and all of the Commonwealth's revenues. For openers in that context, I inform the House that it is calculated that, because of the huge success of the campaign to get people back into private health insurance, the private health insurance tax rebate will consume about $400-500 million more in the current financial year than was estimated at budget time. That is because our policy has been even more successful than it was at the time of the budget. The second comment that I would make is that, on current advice I have from the Treasury, it is calculated that the value or the cost, whichever description you wish to employ, of the aged persons rebate for pensioners and self-funded retirees under the new tax system will be in the order of $500-600 million more than was calculated at the time of the budget. In other words, that section of the Australian population is going to be $500-600 million better off as a result of our tax policy. This is not something that concerns the government: that in these two critical areas people are better off is something that gives great satisfaction to the government. We have seen a historic turnaround in private health insurance usage in this country as a result of policies that have been pursued by this government. So, if you are looking at the government's net budget position in advance of the release of the mid-year economic and financial overview, which will be some time in the next few weeks when all of the details will finally be available, and at this stage if you are trying to speculate in some way about the budget position, if you are talking about gains on one side, you have to make allowance on the other side. - Any suggestion at this stage of some kind of net windfall is completely erroneous. I would also remind the House that the lower than expected CPI could have an impact in relation to the half-yearly indexation of excise different from what has been calculated by some of the government's critics. I have made it plain on a number of occasions, and I make it plain again, that the worst and most irresponsible thing this government could do at the present time is embrace a rundown of the Commonwealth budget surplus.The reason I regard that as irresponsible is that it would exert upward pressure on interest rates. Our predecessors ran up huge budget deficits. We have no intention of doing that. The Labor Party talks about pain being felt by Australians. The most painful thing for Australians in the current economic context would be for a government to pursue a policy that put upward pressure on interest rates. If I have to make a choice between avoiding putting upward pressure on interest rates and embracing some ad hoc approach to the level of excise on petrol, I will always opt in favour of reducing pressure on interest rates. Australians are asking of this government that we do not embrace policies that exert upward pressure on interest rates, but that is what we are getting from the Labor Party. What the Labor Party is saying is, `Grab hold of a policy that puts upward pressure on interest rates.'  That is also the effect of the policies being pursued by a number of the premiers around Australia, who are calling for either a freeze on or a reduction in the excise on petrol. I would say to all of the states other than Queensland that, if they believe that there is some capacity within the governments of Australia to reduce the price of petrol through a reduction in excise or some kind of subsidy to the consumers in their states, let them look to the example of Queensland. Let them look to their own capacity out of their own revenues to cut the price of petrol in their own states. That is not a course of action that I am initiating. I am arguing why there is no capacity at present to make the sort of commitment being asked of us by the AAA or by the opposition. I am saying to the states who argue that we have the capacity, `First, look to your own capacity.' If you look at the arrangements that were concluded when the new tax system was introduced, it is very revealing that effectively, when you take into account that the new arrangements included the guaranteed minimum amount that the states would receive - and that included a component described as revenue replacement payments, which in effect was the equivalent of the 8.3c a litre of petrol excise collected by the Commonwealth on behalf of the states under the old financial arrangements - there is on that basis an amount of $1.7 billion available to the states of Australia, effectively replacing the excise that we used to collect on their behalf, available for the deployment of subsidies to reduce the price of petrol within their own jurisdictions. In other words, every state in Australia has the capacity to do what Queensland has done. Let me go through it: New South Wales has available $647 million, Victoria $461 million, Western Australia $291 million, South Australia $154 million and Tasmania $47 million. I say to those states: before coming to the Commonwealth in a grandstanding political exercise which is not based on principle but is based on political point scoring, you look to your own capacity to provide relief within your own jurisdictions. I am as unhappy as anybody about the impact of increases in the price of crude oil on petrol in Australia, but I have no intention of embracing the irresponsible calls being made at the moment which will have the effect of driving up pressure on interest rates, and that will cause infinitely greater pain for Australians than any of the concerns that they have regarding the price of petrol.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and his interest in economic issues, which allows us to refer to economic issues in the House in the absence of any credible spokesman from the Labor Party on the issue. He is probably aware that the Morgan and Banks survey which was released this morning was headed as follows: `Australia wins gold again: record breaking result for the job market!' Isn't that good news for Australia? It reads:The quarterly Morgan &amp; Banks Job Index released today indicates that 41.9% of Australian organisations will be hiring permanent staff in the next quarter with only 8.4% intending to decrease their employee numbers, giving a net effect of 33.5%. This is the highest level of optimism recorded since the Job Index began in April 1995 ...Isn't that great news? Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, unemployment in Australia peaked at 11.3 per cent when the now Leader of the Opposition was in charge of employment, and it was still 8½ per cent when the government was elected in March 1996. But today it has fallen to 6.3 per cent, which is the lowest in a decade. With good economic management, unemployment can fall further; we can reverse the damage that was done by Labor recessions in the 1990s.Morgan and Banks also had an interesting survey on the new tax system, a survey which was also released today, 1 November 2000. The heading of this survey - it is an interesting one; I think the Prime Minister will find it interesting - was `GST rollback not appropriate'. It reads: A special question formulated for the Morgan &amp; Banks Job Index released today clearly shows that business does not support the ALP proposals to rollback the GST ... A resounding 90.5 per cent of businesses were against roll-back. Roll-back could well be the most unpopular policy invented in the history of the Federation at 90.5 per cent negative approval! - The Prime Minister says that you lose your deposit in a federal election on a 90.5 per cent rate of negative approval. We had the ex-ACTU president down at the Economist Intelligence Unit yesterday giving his presentation. He went in to give his presentation on the economy - what Labor would do if they were elected. Afterwards, I asked the group how he would have explained the roll-back policy, what he would be rolling back on and how business would come to grips with a new GST. After briefing the EIU, he mentioned roll-back not once. There was not one mention in favour of the business taxation reform of roll-back. A total of 90.5 per cent of businesses are against roll-back, and they have not uttered the word `roll-back' since 20 July this year. The person I feel sorriest for is John Della Bosca. Think how old Della feels. Della had his head taken off because he said that the Labor Party should give up their opposition to GST and drop roll-back. Della got decapitated, and what did the Labor Party do? They gave up their opposition to GST and dumped roll-back! Poor old Della! Della ought to be reinstated as the president of the ALP. As for all of those people on the back bench of the Labor Party who actually thought that the leadership of their party was against the GST: you might have actually believed it, yet you are going to run into the next election in favour of GST and against roll-back. Think about it. It is going to be the same on Telstra. The poor old backbench! They tend to believe what they are told by the people down the front here, but it never turns out that particular way. I for one am calling for John Della Bosca's reputation to be reinstated. Della Bosca was the man who told the Labor Party what to do. They did not like that,  but by jingo they did it!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. Without recalling precisely what I said at the summit, I certainly would have said something to that effect. In relation to public sector R&amp;D - the one for which the government is most directly accountable - I think the performance of that has been relatively better than that of private sector R&amp;D. - Indeed, as the Treasurer reminds me, the public provision of the subject matter of the honourable member's question has been very strong. If you make international comparisons, it is strong. In terms of the government's own actions, I would point to that. But the member does raise a broader question. I think members of the House would be aware that with us today are quite a number of representatives of the science community in Australia, and that is very welcome. I hope that all members on both sides have the opportunity of talking to the men and women who represent the science community in this country. The government has before it the recommendations of the Chief Scientist, and it will have within a short period of time some recommendations from the final analysis of the innovation summit. I have indicated on a number of occasions, after receiving final advice from the three ministers most directly concerned, that we will be indicating the government's forward directions in these areas.It is important to recognise that I do not particularly direct these remarks to the science community but perhaps to some in the broader community who are advocating all manner of changes, particularly in the taxation area, to achieve particular outcomes. It is very important for the government to listen carefully to what is being put and to recognise that some of the arguments being advanced to the government have a great deal of substance and some of the arguments have less substance. I believe that when the government does make a final statement on this issue, we will get the right balance between the need for governments at all times to reject the blandishments of those who would seek the cover of a legitimate advocacy of change and improvement - to secure a benefit which, on a proper examination, they are not entitled to - and separate that out from those who make a legitimate claim for increased government assistance.There is, I would argue, an increased role for government in relation to science and to some aspects of innovation and technology. There is also a very strong role for the private sector. It is very important that we separate the two and that we keep a correct balance. To those in the science community who are with us, I respect very much the contribution you make to our community. I have derived a great deal of personal benefit from the workings of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council. I believe that the attitude to be taken by the government and enunciated at an appropriate time in the near future will represent a balanced, forward looking and sensible approach to this very important issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I acknowledge his deep commitment to education, both public and private, in his electorate. These days, parents are rightly demanding that every child should learn fundamental literacy and numeracy skills in the early years of schooling. Australian parents were appalled at the performance of the Labor Party in office when some 30 per cent of young people were found not to be able to read and write properly. As a result of the leadership of this government, there is now agreement between all the state and territory governments and the Commonwealth on national literacy and numeracy standards and on a national plan to deliver literacy and numeracy skills at or above those standards to every child. To achieve this national literacy and numeracy goal, literacy and numeracy need to be top priorities for the education systems in the states. There needs to be evidence of clear progress from year to year.  Everyone will be concerned when evidence emerges that a state is not making the necessary commitment and the necessary progress. I have had my department analyse the recently published results of the New South Wales basic skills test taken earlier this year. The results of this analysis reveal the very disturbing fact that in New South Wales literacy and numeracy standards have slipped back this year over last year. If a proper effort to support teachers had been made, we would have expected further significant progress this year under the national literacy plan. In fact, there has been a decline in standards in New South Wales. Across year 3 and year 5 in both literacy and numeracy, the proportion of students in the lowest skills bands has increased. In the higher bands, year 3 literacy fell by three per cent, year 3 numeracy by five per cent, year 5 literacy was down two per cent and year 5 numeracy declined by an alarming eight per cent.It would not be good enough if standards had simply been maintained this year because under the national plan specific progress is required to be made from year to year, but in fact what we see in New South Wales is that standards are actually declining. What is even more disgraceful is that the New South Wales government has been promoting as acceptable literacy levels which are clearly below the national standard. In doing so, Mr Aquilina has branded the Carr government as a government of low educational standards. It has not mandated time for literacy in the curriculum, as Victoria and South Australia have done. It has not instituted a review of literacy teaching as Queensland has done. It has not established pilot programs to evaluate best practice as the Kennett government has done.Opposition members - The Kennett government! - It has not set out, like the ACT, to improve communication and accountability to parents. The fact is that the Carr government has failed to adequately invest in education in that state. It has failed to match Commonwealth funding increases. It has run down buildings and facilities. It has allowed the New South Wales Teachers Federation to run rampant and it is now persecuting non-government schools. It has sat on its hands as 20,000 students have left government schools over the last four years. Mr Boston, the director of schooling in New South Wales, receives a $20,000 bonus - one dollar for every student who has left public education over the last four years. There is an `ABC of failure' in education in New South Wales - that is, Aquilina, Boston and Carr. That is what they are - an ABC of failure. With declining literacy standards and a failure to make a commitment to what parents and students are most concerned about, we see what the Labor Party means in practice. I urge the New South Wales government to stop its charades, its side shows, and start focusing on the matters of most importance to parents - as this government is doing - proper literacy and numeracy standards for every child.</DOC>

 - Any sort of hope of having an intelligent debate across the party divide on the issue raised in the first part of the honourable member's question was totally destroyed by the sort of cheap invocation of the class divide. I simply say to the honourable member for Dobell that he knows as well as I do that the policy followed by successive governments in this country over a number of years, inaugurated by the Menzies government back in the early 1960s and built upon by successive governments, and particularly built upon by this government through the abolition of Labor's inequitable, unfair, discriminatory new schools policy, has meant that thousands upon thousands of low and middle income people in Australia now have the possibility of exercising choice in the education of their children. I do think people have a right to choose. I regard the right to choose, invested in parents regarding the education of their children, as one of the most sacred rights in our community. It is very clear from the pattern of questions asked by the Labor Party that they do not believe in freedom of choice for Australian parents. In reality, they seek, under the cover of some kind of class smear, to deny to the generality of Australian parents the right of choice.  No matter how you look at the examination of this issue, you find that overwhelmingly the new funding formula provides, in relation to final outcomes, the greatest level of assistance to the most needy independent schools. It is a better formula. It is a formula that has been embraced by the national Catholic education system. It is a formula that has been embraced by other parent bodies. What is going on at the moment is that we are seeing effective competition, and that competition will lift the standards of schools. There has been an exodus of pupils from some government schools into independent schools and that is the result of parents voting with their feet, exercising their choice and expressing a preference for one particular form of education over another. I regard that as a wholly healthy development, not something to be criticised under the cover of a class smear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie, who has a keen interest in these matters. The ACCC released a very comprehensive review of the price impact of the new tax system. That involved the collection of data from around 10,000 retail outlets in 115 cities across Australia, including 90 towns in regional Australia. The important part of the survey is that it covers the period from May this year to August this year. It covers a very important period, obviously, during the introduction of the new tax system. It is a comprehensive survey and I took the opportunity before question time to check out whether the Labor Party had done any surveys of prices during that period. The most comprehensive survey that the Labor Party did - this is, of course, apart from the contribution of the member for Melbourne - was the Lilley price watch, which everyone might remember. I went to the site and there was comprehensive data from August last year, October last year, November last year, December last year, February this year, March this year and April this year - and then it stopped. I thought there might have been something wrong with the mouse or something wrong with the Internet - but, no, it seemed pretty comprehensive. I would table the survey but it says `copyright Wayne Swan 2000'; it cannot be reproduced without the express approval of the author. I can only presume that all the surveyors had gone off to the electoral inquiry in Queensland, so he did not have anyone to get any data that could have been useful to the Labor Party. If it was not that, I ask the question: why did the Labor Party stop surveying prices after April? Might it be related to the fact that the prices did not match up to their rhetoric? Might it be that they lied to the Australian people about the GST before 1 July? Could it be that roll-back ate up the Lilley price watch? We can only speculate.   What became clear when we did a little bit more research was that the rhetoric of the Labor Party did not match reality. Funny that, isn't it? The words of the Labor Party before 1 July did not actually match what happened after 1 July. There was a very obvious case in relation to car prices. I went back over some words. The member for Kingston told radio 5DN in December last year that `people have been told erroneously that the prices of new vehicles' - after July 1 next year - will fall `by several thousand dollars'. Erroneously! The member for Fraser said in a press release on 8 May that it was a myth that cars would be cheaper under the GST. He said it was simply not true that cars would be cheaper after the introduction of the GST. The comprehensive reports from the ACCC state that, in relation to cars, `There has been a general price cut of six per cent for new cars' since the introduction of the GST. I think it is about time the Labor Party apologised to Australian consumers for all its rhetoric and all its scaremongering before 1 July. We wait to hear the details of roll-back. </DOC>

The exact detail of the response I cannot recall at this point, and I think the honourable member did make the point that the original response was made some time ago. I am happy to go into the number of questions I was asked, the reference from the Remuneration Tribunal to the department, some reference to certain senators raised in the honourable member's question and certain information that he indicated he has asked for but to which, despite some degree of time lapse, a response has not yet been forthcoming. There are some detailed questions there. I can only take them on notice and report back to the honourable member in due course.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the Job Network is already subject to a very high level of scrutiny. It is subject to scrutiny by the parliament, including the Senate estimates committees. It is subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General and other statutory agencies. It is subject to scrutiny by my department, which has some 150 staff engaged in contract management and which runs the Job Network complaints hotline. This obviously is not enough for the member for Dickson, who wants to invent a new bureaucracy designed to keep Job Network members honest because she trusts bureaucracies more than she trusts the Salvation Army, Mission Employment, Centacare and great private sector organisations like Work Directions. This government believes that Job Network members should be getting people work, not suffocating under red tape.The interesting thing about the member for Dickson is that she never has a good word for the Job Network; yet she tries to have us believe that she supports the system. This week, the member for Dickson claimed that Job Network members were `parking' hard to help job seekers. She claimed that they were failing to provide training. She claimed that they were throwing vulnerable people off benefits. She accused them of profiteering. She did not name anyone. She did not produce a skerrick of evidence. It is a disgraceful smear on people who are doing the right thing by the job seekers of Australia, and it ought to be repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition. All this talk of accountability masks Labor's real agenda, which is to renationalise employment services and to recreate the old, failed CES.</DOC>

 - I welcome the honourable member's question, and I refer specifically to his last statement about a loss of  tens of millions of dollars. I am sure the House would be fully aware that the master of disaster, when it comes to economic management, is the Leader of the Opposition. When it comes to losing taxpayers' dollars, I simply refer to a couple of points. Firstly, the debt servicing in respect of $70 billion of general government debt increase in the last five deficit budgets under Labor -  - I am more than pleased to return to the question. As I was indicating, when it comes to losses of taxpayers' dollars - which was part of the question - quite clearly the Leader of the Opposition has a record in submarines, in managing employment programs, and in running up deficits, year after year, that no-one will equal in my lifetime or in the lifetimes of my children. In respect of Employment National -  -  - You clearly do not want to know about Employment National, with all those interjections. The government gave careful consideration to the position of Employment National after the Job Network 2 contract decisions were announced in the latter part of last year. We gave careful consideration to the future of Employment National. In the lead-up to the allocation of those contracts, I had significant consultations of various nature with the board of Employment National. In respect of the bids which they put in for the Job Network 2 contracts, I asked if they had given this careful consideration and they indicated to me that they had. They assured me that they had put in competitive tenders in respect of those contracts and that they had made provision for a minor loss of those contracts.  We know that when the contracts were awarded - in a competitive manner and subject to absolute probity - very few of the intensive assistance contracts were awarded to Employment National. Consequently, the revenue and the workload that flowed from the allocation of Job Network 2 contracts to Employment National changed significantly. After careful consideration, the government took the view that there was a role for Employment National in the area of job matching, where it had performed admirably and where it had been awarded a significant increase in the contracts in Job Network 2 compared to Job Network 1.When it came to continuing in the current structure, there were discussions with the board about what they saw as the way forward, and certain advices were given - entirely appropriate advices from a board in that position in the context of their duties under the Corporations Law. The government took the decision that it wanted to proceed with a public employment agency, with Employment National. In taking that decision, the government made it abundantly clear that it was prepared to back the company in the way forward. In the circumstances of all that, a direction was given to proceed with the contracts in job matching. It is still performing those contracts, and the appropriate backup was given. But there was a new phase; it was a restructuring of the company, and the skills for restructuring were necessary. The view, after careful consideration, was that there ought to be a structure in the board that would carry it through that phase. It is as simple as that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In response to the question, I would like to announce the release today of a document that has been put together by Austrade in conjunction with the University of New South Wales. It is an analysis of the benefits to our economy of trade and exports. One of the opening comments in the document is that `exports are good for workers'. It goes on to say that `the net effect of trade on jobs will depend on both growth rates and structural change in the economy' - both of which our government is providing to our economy. It goes on to say:An open economy that is competitive and growing will produce more better quality jobs than a closed, stagnant economy that is unable to adapt to new technology and changes in world economic conditions. This report, entitled Why Australia needs exports, shows that exporters pay their workers, on average, $17,400 a year more than non-exporting businesses. Exporters are more innovative; they provide their staff with safer, healthier workplaces; they provide more training; and they are committed to career development. The report also shows that exporters use enterprise agreements far more than the award structure and that those agreements are delivering much higher wages and efficiency gains for workers in export industries. Average earnings in export industries are around $46,000 per year compared to $28,000 a year for workers in non-exporting businesses. I remind the House that these flexible enterprise agreements that have been made between individual workers and their employers were given the opportunity to exist by this government but were opposed all the way by the Labor Party, which wants to scrap them. The agreements provide an opportunity for the 1.7 million workers in Australia who rely on export industries for their jobs to earn a better salary.Yesterday the ABS released the export figures for the month of September. They were outstanding, to say the least. We recognise that the great outcome was supported by the Olympic Games. Our economy accrued a lot of benefit from the Olympic Games. The government took great advantage of that, and we ran a number of different programs promoting trade and investment opportunities in Australia during the Olympics. We had about 16,000 visitors through Business Club Australia, who participated in about 97 different functions and networking events. Business Club Australia was a huge success. We set ourselves a target of $1 billion worth of new business. Already, not long after the closing ceremony, we have achieved $700 million worth of new deals - and some very interesting deals. There has been a $150 million investment by Global Switch of the UK to build a leading edge Internet facility in Sydney. The WA based Australian Foods Company Ltd has signed multimillion dollar deals to provide peas and beans to India and the Middle East. The Paris based Infogrames Entertainment is investing $25 million over two years in Melbourne, generating more than 160 jobs. An Australian company that some of the starlets on the other side might be interested in, Vitamen, which is a manufacturer of men's cosmetic products - the member for Hunter might be interested in this one - is expected to secure substantial orders from Europe as a result of its involvement in Business Club Australia. So it has been a great success. We have taken advantage of it with the programs we ran during the Olympic Games. Quite a few of the 41.9 per cent of businesses that intend to put on new employees in the not too distant future - as contained in the Morgan and Banks survey - will be exporters and will be employing people. They will be paying higher wages, and that is why we remain committed to expanding our export effort, as we have, and taking great advantage, as we did, of the opportunities during the Olympic Games.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Dickson referred to the annual report which was tabled yesterday in the House. The report confirmed what was stated in the budget. In fact, it confirmed what the government announced in early February this year - that it had made a decision to keep Employment National operational. It recognised that Employment National provided a valuable service in the employment creation area and it provided assistance for people seeking jobs, particularly in rural and regional Australia. That was the basis of the decision earlier this year. The budget this year indicated that there would be a $54 million contribution over a three-year period whilst the company went through the restructuring. - Oh, just be patient! The honourable member for Dickson asked me whether this loss was a result of handing back the intensive assistance contracts that expired at the end of February this year. When the decision was made to continue on with Employment National, when the decision was made to accept the contracts in December last year -  - I would have thought I was being too good. The honourable member asked me why the government continued -   - Obviously they have little or no regard for those programs of the government that assist people in getting jobs. The question related to the intensive assistance contracts. The question was: why were they handed back; why weren't they continued; how much loss occurred as a result of their being handed back? - Right. If you are just patient! Quite clearly the advice that was given in respect of those intensive assistance programs, which expired at the end of February this year - in other words, within a very short period of time of when the decision was made - was that, if there had been a continuation of those programs and a running down of those programs past the expiry time at the end of February, it could have led to further losses of between $8 million and $14 million. To suggest that we should have kept those contracts on is plainly ludicrous.As I have said, the government made a decision to continue with Employment National. It gave the necessary support. It assisted the board going through the restructuring, matching its revenue and the work that it was doing to gain revenue, significantly reduced from the Job Network 1 area, and keeping in place a number of the offices of Employment National. To have closed it down at that time would have brought a further 750 job losses, particularly in rural and regional Australia. We believe it has a contribution to make in assisting people to get jobs, and we will continue to back it. The budget showed $54 million, and that $54 million is exactly the same figure that is referred to as the contribution that is coming from the budget in the annual report that was released and tabled yesterday.</DOC>

 - My thanks to the member for Grey for this important question. I acknowledge the great significance of the fishing industry in his own electorate and the powerful way in which he represents their interests in this parliament. Yesterday the Prime Minister, when reporting on his attendance at the Pacific Islands Forum, referred to signing the important Convention on Conservation and Management of the Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Central and Western Pacific Region. This convention has the potential to significantly advance the sustainable management of the fishing resources of the region. The negotiations to this convention have been going on now for six years between Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands and, of course, some of the important fishing countries in the region such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan. The fact that this agreement has been reached is certainly a significant milestone. The tuna fisheries in Australia are worth something like $60 million, and we are naturally anxious to ensure that the stocks are sustainably managed so that this industry can continue to contribute towards our economy. The convention will establish a commission into the management of these stocks and will place particular emphasis on issues such as an effective decision making process and dispute settlement arrangements. The commission will aim to sustainably manage the highly migratory fish stocks of the region, particularly tuna and shark, and will look at minimising any adverse environmental impacts from fishing. From our perspective, the next step will be to negotiate and discuss the issues with the relevant parties so that Australia can proceed towards ratification of the treaty at the earliest possible occasion. Under this convention, the Australian east coast tuna fishery can look forward to an improved management regime for marine resources in the region and the setting of allocation, particularly total allocation catches, for all the fishers in the region. It will require vessel monitoring systems throughout the region and, of course, better research into stock numbers and greater certainty about the long-term future of the industry. This is a significant breakthrough, and the fact that the Prime Minister was able to sign this convention on Australia's behalf at this forum demonstrates the great significance that our nation places on fish management issues.

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question in relation to a protocol that is in place in the Department of Finance and Administration in relation to matters that come before it dealing with irregularities or alleged irregularities. I was asked a number of questions following that in respect of actions taken by other people, including the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, and I was asked to confirm to the House whether strict adherence to that protocol had occurred at all times. I can say that, as far as I am aware, that protocol was the protocol under which the various inquiries and investigations were conducted over the latter part of last year and earlier this year by the department of finance - very much at arm's length from the government. As far as I am aware, that protocol was followed and followed properly. I will look again at the detailed questions that were asked. I will take it on board. I am asked to give assurances about other people. I believe it is appropriate, when I am asked such matters, to make appropriate inquiries. As far as I am aware, those procedures were followed meticulously and properly. In fact, the department carried out its duties in a meticulous fashion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I thank him for being a very gracious host two weeks ago in Broken Hill when I took the Secretary General of the World Health Organisation, Dr Brundtland, at her request, to have a look at some things that were happening in indigenous health. It is very easy to be gloomy about indigenous health or think that everything happening in indigenous health is black. In fact, things are working very well in many parts of the country. I mention some examples in the electorate of the member for Parkes that I was able to show Dr Brundtland. The Maari-ma Aboriginal controlled health service was something we funded in 1996. Aboriginal people in Broken Hill had very little access to health services prior to this. They used the local hospital on a sporadic basis. Maari-ma is now employing a GP five days a week, a dentist two days a month and six out of its 10 staff are indigenous. They have a comprehensive primary health care service across the whole Broken Hill area. They have a home visiting service for people with high blood pressure and people with diabetes and they are working actively and cooperatively with the RFDS to provide outreach services for communities in the Broken Hill area.  With Dr Brundtland we visited Sydney University's Department of Rural Health. This was something the government promised in its 1996 election platform. It was built in 1997 and today it is employing around 60 people and training a whole range of students, from Aboriginal health workers right through to medical students. This is part of a revolution in health education in Australia. Within five years we will see 20 per cent of all medical education physically located outside capital cities. While the member for Parkes and I were at the university Department of Rural Health we met Aboriginal health workers who were in training. We were told five years ago that there were only three Aboriginal health workers in the area. Today we have 30 in training. Also in the electorate of the member for Parkes we have recently been able to announce funding for the Burke Aboriginal Medical Service to upgrade its infrastructure. This is part of our indigenous health infrastructure program that we brought in in the 1998 budget. The Prime Minister has taken a personal interest in this. It was he who was able to let Burke know that we can provide nearly half a million dollars for them to immediately upgrade enormously substandard facilities. There are a couple of other things, some small, some big, that I think give us reason for optimism. For example, on the Tiwi Islands a program has been run over the last four years that has reduced by 50 per cent the rate of people going on to end stage renal disease. This is an extraordinary achievement. The government, along with Rio Tinto, are jointly funding an expansion of this through the Northern Territory and Queensland, with an idea of rolling it out through all remote communities in Australia. Honourable members who represent these electorates will know how much of a problem renal disease is - and it is growing - in some parts of Australia. We have actively turned it around with intervention. In the member for Grey's electorate in the Pitjantjatjara lands we are trialling new ways of accessing the Health Insurance Commission. Doctors have told us it is absolutely impossible to use normal Medicare facilities to be able to bill for and get access to Medicare services for the indigenous people. Through the Health Insurance Commission we have found a way of using their own identification system. They are accessing Medicare dollars, as they rightly should, but as they have not been able to up till now. In the member for Leichhardt's electorate I have recently signed off on funding for primary health care services in the outer Torres Strait Islands. The thing that perhaps I am most excited about is a letter I got a couple of weeks ago from the Katherine West Aboriginal Corporation that is running the coordinated care trial. This has been going for two years. It is a new way of providing services in an Aboriginal community. I would like to read honourable members part of their letter. They say to me: Emergency admissions have decreased significantly and the planned and elective admissions have increased. These are both good trends. The drop in emergency admissions is likely to be an outcome of better service levels, our increase in clinic staff numbers and putting GPs in remote communities where they have never been before, while the increase in planned admissions reflects people being more conscious of their health status and  looking after themselves better. So these are all things that have happened in a relatively short period of time. There is still an enormous amount more to do, but I do believe we have some reason to be optimistic. </DOC>

 - I have had a look at the -  - I have had a look at the Minchin protocol. It appears that this devastating expose coming from the opposition turns upon the proposition that, after getting advice from the Attorney-General, there was something odd about my then - on the Attorney-General's advice - referring the matter to the Australian Federal Police instead of sending it back to the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration so that he could refer it to the Attorney-General. I am devastated by that expose. At least it is better than the Evans-Beazley protocol. The Evans-Beazley protocol meant that it never went to the police. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for McPherson, a very fine member and my electoral neighbour. She knows, as do all members of the coalition - it was even in the ABS statistics recently - that child care is becoming substantially more affordable under the Howard-Anderson government. It is interesting that recently ABS statistics were saying that more Australian families are using child care now than ever before. What was interesting in press comments over the weekend was that the largest fall for the CPI recorded in the last three months was a 15 per cent reduction. Where? In child care. We certainly did not see that on the Lilley price watch list, did we?What is even more important is that 94 per cent of families now, according to the ABS, are happy with their formal child-care arrangements. They are happy. Why? Because we are meeting the needs of Australian families. Why is that? Because we have put substantially more resources through the child-care benefit into child care. We are making it more affordable, particularly for low and middle income earners. These are the policies of the new tax system, where child care is GST free and rebatable, but most importantly there is new money. Some $900 million of new money went into the child-care benefit for the next four years, which is part of the $5.6 billion that we are putting into place. In the last four years, we put $4 billion into child care, which was 30 per cent more than the Labor Party did in its last four years of stewardship. You can ask a lot of organisations about this. The national children's services forum came to see me the other day. It is made up of long day care centres, family day care, community day care and after hours school care. All of them were saying that their services are running at maximum capacity - are being used by more families - as a direct result of the child-care benefit. I mentioned once before in this parliament that, even in the electorate of the member for Lilley, St Paul's Lutheran child care - I am sure the member for Lilley knows it well - recently told my office they have seen big differences, that they are now full, that there have been no fee increases, that parents are happy and things are a lot better. What are the comments of the member for Lilley? We know that back on 28 March you were beating your chest in here, claiming how unaffordable child care was. Even back in August you were claiming that we have cut funding from child care. How can we cut it when we put $900 million more in? We have actually increased funding. You are terribly confused, because the only policy the Australian Labor Party have when it comes to child care - well, they do not have a policy or they have rolled it back - is the scare campaign and the damage the Labor Party have done to the child-care industry over the last couple of years in basically claiming that prices have gone out of control. Prices did go out of control when the Labor Party were in government. Why? They accelerated at twice the rate. You had an ad hoc system, you had no quality and planning and you had no control. What the government is continuing to do through our stronger families and stronger communities package is put in more money to allow for more flexibility in child care, particularly for shift workers, particularly for families who have sick children or families in regional and remote Australia who do not have child-care services. That was never done by the Australian Labor Party. My advice to the member for Lilley is this: you should spend more time on the ground in your own electorate than abroad; go along and visit some of your child-care centres. While you are at it, you might take some of your mates from the AWU with you. You could even enrol them. It would be cheaper than attending the CJC inquiry, and they could do with some supervision from what they have been doing in cooking the electoral books. </DOC>

 - I well remember -  -  - I well remember that question that was asked of me on the Thursday of the last sitting week prior to this sitting week. I note that subsequently I issued a press release, the following week, after I proceeded to make due inquiries of Telstra as to what their computer records contained and as to what annotations may have been on the paper print-out of those computer records. The inquiry revealed that there were no computer records that indicated any annotation there in any shape or form. I subsequently made that public the following Friday. I noted, with some degree of bewilderment almost, that the honourable member for Melbourne then accused me of misleading the House for not answering a question I was not asked. I found that an extraordinary statement from the honourable member for Melbourne, as was revealed when he subsequently endeavoured to raise the issue again on one of the Sunday programs. It seems the honourable member for Melbourne believes that ministers should have some degree of telepathy when they come to the dispatch box -  - And wonder what the question should be. - and wonder what the question should be and answer it in case it should have been something different. I made it abundantly clear that Telstra informed me that there was nothing on their records that related to any particular matter in May 1998, and a search of their records in the information that was provided to me through my department, through my office, indicated there was no substance in the question I was asked on that day in the House.</DOC>

 - The allegation forming the basis of the question is wrong, but I will nonetheless have something to say about the issue of changing petrol excise. What I did say yesterday, and what I say today, is that, in all the submissions that have been put to the government by the premiers and by others, the one thing this government will not do is take any action that is going to put upward pressure on interest rates. If you run down the surplus, it is the view of the government, particularly in the present circumstances, that that could, and almost certainly would, put upward pressure on interest rates. Nothing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says can alter that fact. If he wants to align himself with those who want higher interest rates, let him pay the price for that in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, which was certainly worth waiting for. There is obviously a penetrating analysis in his question. A number of state premiers have tried to position themselves before the COAG meeting tomorrow as being in favour of lower excise on petrol. It is very interesting to see that some of these state premiers have a great deal of experience. Tomorrow, Mr Beattie will attend the COAG meeting, and I think it is well known that it was Mr Beattie who, on 1 July this year, tried to abolish a subsidy on petrol so that he could blame it on the GST. It was not until he was caught by the Commonwealth and fingered that he reversed his position. One of the other premiers who will be attending the COAG meeting tomorrow is Mr Bracks. I do not know whether it is commonly known that Mr Bracks was once an adviser, a Labor Party staffer, to a former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the member for Burke, Mr Neil O'Keefe. Throughout Mr O'Keefe's tenure as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, let us have a guess how many times he froze indexation on petrol. -  - On not one occasion. Let us have a guess as to how many times Mr Bracks, the Labor Party staffer, advocated a freeze on indexation on petrol. -  - Not on one occasion. While Mr Bracks was actually working as a Labor Party staffer to Mr O'Keefe, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, after they had put in place full indexation, that was not enough. They went into the parliament after the 1993 election and, after delivering full indexation, actually legislated a 5c a litre increase, which of course affected the CPI. Did the Labor Party then say that the CPI ought to be discounted for the inflation caused by their own excise? On not one occasion. No doubt Mr Bracks will have an explanation when he comes to Canberra tomorrow about what he did as a Labor Party staffer to freeze indexation and how he justified a five per cent discretionary increase.It is also not commonly known - and this ought to be on the record - that under the new tax system the Commonwealth guarantees to the states the equivalent of 8c a litre in revenue. Petrol excise is 38c, and the Commonwealth guarantees to the states the equivalent revenue of 8c per litre. Some of the states take that revenue and give a subsidy back in relation to petrol. Queensland is one of them. The Queensland government tried to take the subsidy away on 1 July but, because the Commonwealth found out, it was forced to put it back. Out of that 8c a litre that the Commonwealth pays the state of Victoria, Mr Bracks pockets 6.6c a litre for himself. If Mr Bracks were really interested in doing something about petrol excise, he could introduce a subsidy of 6.6c a litre out of the money he is paid by the Commonwealth, because that is the amount that he is currently pocketing. The New South Wales government is currently pocketing 7.2c per litre; the Western Australian government, 6.2c per litre; the South Australian government, 6.3c per litre; and the Tasmanian government, 5.9c per litre. If the state premiers really believe they would like to reduce excise and reduce the price of petrol, they all have the means, outside of Queensland, to do so. Mr Bracks could do it tomorrow by 6.6c a litre and Mr Carr could do it by 7.2c a litre.This argument from the state premiers that somehow they are against the excise but they want the money it raises is not a straightforward argument. It is the kind of argument that premiers have grown used to over the course of Federation - we have seen it before - but it is not a forthright argument. I heard the answer of the Prime Minister just a moment ago on the question of taxes and the budget position. I came across this statement by a Prime Minister on 1 November 2000, who said:There is no argument between me and anybody that petrol prices are too high. If I blew the whole of the budget surplus on a fuel duty cut, I could do nothing for pensioners and interest rates would go up.That was said by Prime Minister Tony Blair on 1 November - the hero of the Labor Party. - Some mothers do have `em, because the member for Hotham, on cue, intervenes in support of Tony Blair. The House might be interested in the policy that Mr Blair is administering. In the UK, under Mr Blair, excise is 49 pence per litre, which equates to $1.32 per litre. In the UK, the GST on top of that is 17½ per cent. The price of fuel in the UK equates to $2.19 per litre, with the total tax being $1.70. Here we have the Labor Party's hero, Mr Blair, saying - in my view quite rightly - that he has to have a view to his surplus and interest rates. They will accept it from Mr Blair, who has a tax of $1.70 a litre, but apparently they will not accept it from the Prime Minister, who says the same thing and has a tax of 38c excise a litre. If there were any credibility in any of these claims from the Labor Party, or from former Labor Party staffers like Mr Bracks, the answer lies precisely in their own hands, and if the premiers were really serious about it they have the capacity to fix it tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He asked me what I had to say to the shareholders of Telstra. I want to say this to them. There was a report by Standard and Poor's and a report by Moody's a few months ago that indicated that one of the factors that was restraining the expansion and growth of Telstra was the fact that it was still partly in government hands. The reports made it clear that, if the company were able to operate extensively out there without the restrictions that have been placed on it by being partly in government hands, it would have a significant impact on its capacity in the future. But of course we know that Labor says one thing in its policy and, on the other hand, runs around to merchant bankers - investment bankers - to get advice about breaking up and selling off Telstra. Everybody knows that, when in government, they would do just that, so perhaps those shareholders would acknowledge that the government's policy, should there ever be a change of government, may come to pass anyhow. Heaven forbid, but it may come to pass in any event.The government made it abundantly clear when the prospectus was issued for the sale of shares in the second tranche of Telstra that all who sought to invest should seek their own advice - they should seek the advice of their broker and they should read the prospectus carefully. It is also clear that the overwhelming majority of those who invested in Telstra saw it as a medium- or long-term investment. I believe it is a great Australian company. I believe it does have the ability to do a number of good things for this country and for its shareholders. We should stop the farce that Labor continues to perpetrate that it ought to remain partly in government hands even though we know that Labor propose to break it up and sell it off if they ever get the chance to do just that. It is a medium- to long-term investment. Paper losses are just that.One might argue what the paper gains were in respect of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which Labor sold for about $2. When I last looked, they were running at about $32. I will not criticise Labor for selling them, with that massive spike that occurred in the intervening years. Because they were out there and were able to operate totally commercially, I think the Labor government did the right thing there, just as I know most of them over there believe that the right thing that should be done for Telstra is to allow it to be sold off in an orderly fashion at an appropriate time so that it can operate properly in the interests of the company and in the interests of all shareholders.</DOC>

 - This government has demonstrated its commitment to tackling vital natural resource management issues, particularly dryland salinity. These are vital issues for rural and regional Australia and, indeed, for our entire nation. Salinity issues certainly also address urban environments and affect our national infrastructure and indeed our capacity to be a productive nation into the future. On 10 October the Prime Minister announced a $1.5 billion initiative which he will be putting to state leaders at the COAG meeting tomorrow. But that is not the first thing that this government has done in relation to addressing salinity matters. The $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust has been the biggest program of action in our nation's history to address natural resource management issues, and salinity programs have been high on the agenda. In the three years to the end of the last financial year, some 562 projects were funded in the dryland salinity area, and there is another 216 to be funded in the next year. We have also funded the $30 million National Land and Water Resources Audit, which is paying particular interest to salinity matters. A lot of work is being done in research and development. We are funding the National Dryland Salinity Program and the CSIRO's Land and Water Division, and the Bureau of Rural Science and the Australian Geological Survey Organisation are receiving significant research and development funding. Of course, the cooperative research centres are also being supported by the federal government in that regard.So we have the runs on the board. We have demonstrated our commitment in that regard. Of course, the primary and the constitutional responsibility for land and water management issues rests with the states. So they must also play a role in addressing these significant issues. They have their opportunity tomorrow at the COAG conference to take up the lead demonstrated by the Prime Minister and this government and to commit themselves to this vital national objective. Unfortunately, some of the state premiers seem to want to address peripheral issues and avoid the big picture matters that are really important to our country and the sorts of things that premiers and prime ministers ought to be talking about when they get together for these quite rare these days but significant national gatherings. We are not the only people who think that this is an important issue and that salinity ought to be addressed as a top priority at tomorrow's COAG meeting. I have just seen a news release put out under the heading `COAG must focus on salinity'. It has come from the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation. They urge the state leaders to agree at tomorrow's meeting of COAG to the Prime Minister's national action plan on salinity and water quality and its framework of implementation. They know what the priority issue is. They go on to say that it is urgent that we get on with the job of turning around the degradation of our environment. So this is the flagship issue. It is the matter put on the agenda by the Prime Minister because of its high national priority. I call on the states to get on with the job and talk about the really important issues. Let us work cooperatively together to address this vital national agenda item.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Perth demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge in these matters in the context of that question. I said earlier in answer to a question from the honourable member for Perth that the Telstra instalment receipt holders, who no longer are instalment receipt holders as at today, should look at the reports issued by Standard and Poor's and by Moody's - the rating agencies - who made a very clear observation of what they believed was in the best interests of Telstra and its shareholders. That clear observation was that partial government ownership was not in the longer term interests of those shareholders. That was the claim. I referred the honourable member for Perth to the statements made by those internationally recognised rating agencies.The first part of the question referred me to a statement that was signed off by me in the offer document. That is a fact. We were selling 16.6 per cent of shares in Telstra, bringing the total sale of shares in Telstra up to 49.9 per cent, leaving 50.1 per cent in the government's hands, at the conclusion of that offer. That is fact. The policy of the government has been on the record long before the last election. Long before the last election it has been the government's intention to sell its remaining shares in Telstra in an orderly fashion at an appropriate time, subject to the market and all of those other factors. There was never going to be a rushed sale, and, of course, there was a condition attached to it, which was that there was to be an independent report as to the adequacy of service levels with particular regard to rural and regional Australia. That report was done independently. Its results are out there. They have been known to the Australian public for some considerable time. That does not change the policy of the government. It still has the intention of proceeding in an orderly fashion.The honourable member for Perth quotes to me some statement that has been made by my colleague. I do not know whether that was accurate or not and, as is the time honoured tradition on this side of the House, we will have a good look at that because we cannot rely upon the words that are alleged to have been said and coming from that side of the House to be accurate. So I will have a look at that aspect of it, but I see the whole question to be really a non-question. Yes, we do own 50.1 per cent; we were always going to after offering last year's 16.6 per cent. That is a fact. As to the claims of what is in the interests of Telstra, I again ask the honourable member for Perth to even perhaps take a little bit of notice of international rating agencies. You do not have to listen to what I might have to say, but you really ought to listen to what they say. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and welcome the opportunity to make some further comments following on from what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has already said. There is no doubt in my mind, and I think in the minds of all who are aware of the extent of dryland salinity and water quality problems in this country, that they are indeed amongst the greatest - if not the greatest - national challenges that we in fact face.There is a bit of a view in some quarters that perhaps this is a problem both caused by and confined to affecting farmers. Even at its most basic level, that is not right, for the simple reason that we all eat and we all wear clothing and we are dependent upon clothing and on the fibres and what have you that are produced on the land in Australia. Many of our jobs and a great deal of our export income comes from the land. It should also be acknowledged that many of the decisions made and the practices that have been engaged in in rural and regional Australia have not been the result of decisions made simply by farmers but also by everybody from researchers through to the CSIRO and extension services provided through the state departments of agriculture. It is a deep and multifaceted problem. It should also be observed that it is a problem that strikes not just our land. Salinity affects 2.5 million hectares, five per cent of the cultivated land in this country, and it is on the way, if we do not act, to becoming 30 per cent of the nation's land. But it is also a transport problem, a communications problem, a housing problem and a public infrastructure problem. Indeed, in eight Murray-Darling Basin catchments alone in New South Wales and Victoria, dryland salinity and saline water are costing more than $250 million a year, with around $120 million of that falling on farmers. Water treatment costs are estimated at $450 million a year, algal blooms at around $200 million a year, and some 40 per cent of streams are in poor health; many are deteriorating.As the minister for agriculture noted, a lot has been done. This government has put in place an unprecedentedly large and extensive program through the Natural Heritage Trust but the Commonwealth action plan that is to be discussed tomorrow commits around $1.5 billion to further addressing this very serious national problem. It will seek to address community driven action targeted at key catchments and regions, to be supported by governments through such things as technical assistance, skills training, information, funding for on-ground works, research on new commercial opportunities and transitional adjustment assessments.There are no simple solutions or one-size-fits-all approaches. Trees may, for example, be the solution or part of the solution in some areas, but they certainly will not be of themselves a simple panacea. As we confront this difficult issue, it has to be said - it has to be emphasised - that it is of critical importance that the states play their full role. The Prime Minister will be asking for their commitment at tomorrow's COAG meeting. The states will need to commit to spending $700 million on this plan to match the Commonwealth contribution. It has to be real cash; there can be no cost shifting on this exercise. States cannot be allowed to walk away from their obligation to help address this problem.The other point I want to make is that the states cannot walk away from their responsibilities in relation to water rights either. There must be a willingness to pay compensation to landowners where the rules change to achieve sustainable natural resource use, such as through clawing back overallocated water rights and entitlements that have been given by successive governments of all political persuasions over many decades. It is very important that we recognise the principle that land-holders' rights must be recognised in the interests of not only those land-holders but those others in rural communities across the nation that are going to have to cope with the adjustment, which in some cases will be quite severe and painful. The Commonwealth has always acknowledged this principle. It is in fact enshrined in the Constitution. But we have had a bit of a battle to get states like New South Wales to recognise this very important principle. It is a moral and a political responsibility that they have continued to run away from, and New South Wales Premier Carr and his counterparts in other states must back their state rights rhetoric with real action on sustainable natural resource management. They must accept our plan. They must pull their weight and meet their moral responsibility.</DOC>

 - My recollection of the trumpet-blowing that is described that way by the honourable member for Perth in September of last year is the fact that the government received a sum of money that enabled it to pay off a significant proportion of Labor's debt, that $70 billion that was chalked up in their last five deficit budgets. - I have been meticulously careful, as I am obliged to be under the Corporations Law or otherwise in the role that I play, not to comment on the value of the shares. I can assure you that in all of the lead-up to the sale of Telstra 2 my words were chosen very carefully in the context of referring all prospective purchasers to what was in the prospectus - to read the prospectus carefully and to seek independent advice if they chose to do so. It was pointed out on a number of occasions by me that shares go up, shares go down and shares stay the same. The honourable member for Perth wants to draw attention today to the fact that there is a paper figure on the value of Telstra shares that is somewhat less than the price that was paid for them a year or so ago. There are many factors. The market, of course, has a big effect. It may refer to the trading of a particular company. It may refer to the sector that company is in, in this case the technology sector and the communications sector. If one wants to look at the sector, one can say that Telstra shares in terms of price changes in the last 12 months have fared much better than those of comparable, and in many cases larger, telcos around the world. There has been a marked drop in prices for telcos the world round. That is a sector factor. It may depend to some extent on what the market is doing generally. I think most of us would know - obviously the honourable member for Perth does not - that the market has taken a significant downturn in recent months. Many of those factors are in play. The government made it abundantly clear in the written documents and, I am fairly confident, in everything I said that it is a matter for individual purchasers to make their decision. The market research, the inquiry that was made, indicated quite clearly that most of the investors that went into Telstra did so on the basis of its being a medium- to long-term investment. On that basis, there is no loss until such time as they have to sell, and there is a little bit of time to go before one could describe the 12 months as being anywhere approaching medium-term, let alone long-term, investment.</DOC>

 - I am happy to advise the member for Moreton on the outcome of the retail trade figures today. The retail trade figures for the month of September, seasonally adjusted, rose by 0.8 per cent, contrary to expectations that there would be a fall correcting off an extremely high result last month. The 0.8 per cent rise for the month of September came following a rise of 5.7 per cent in the month of August, and through the year to September retail trade has grown by a very healthy 4.7 per cent. The increase in the month of September was certainly affected by spending associated with the Sydney Olympic Games. The net impact for the month of September was estimated to be $170 million, based on a combination of direct measurement of retail activity within Olympic venues and an estimate of retail activity outside the venues. But clothing and soft goods, other retailing and hospitality services recorded increases in September. Because there was the effect of the Sydney Olympics, as to be expected New South Wales recorded the largest increase in retail trade, while other states also recorded increases. Given the volatility caused by the introduction of the new tax system, the trend series in current price terms remains suspended from June 2000. But the evident activity in the month of September, coming off such a strong month, I am sure would be welcomed even by the Labor Party. - I am sure it would be welcomed -  - Mr Speaker, he always yells loudest when the news is the worst for the Labor Party and the best for Australia. I have never seen a group of people more committed to running their own country down and rejoicing in bad figures. He interjects the loudest as the figures are the best. We do not find any positive contribution or economic thought from the member for Hotham - just the tried and true slogans of the trade union officialdom which he represents.Retail trade benefited substantially from the September Olympics, as did the international trade position. It is clear that there was a one-off effect from the new tax system which led to a large increase before it came in, then a fall-off and then a recovery. The basis is still abnormally high, and so I would expect it to come off as the market adjusts in future months. But these figures are stronger than expected, consistent with good activity in the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, but I think it is drawing a very long bow indeed to be concluding that CASA are somehow singularly responsible for the issue of blood clotting on long-distance flights around the world. That is obviously an issue that confronts aviation experts and airline companies right around the world; it is not confined to this country. Since he has raised it, I will approach CASA and see what their view on it happens to be. - Dear, oh dear, oh dear! I really think that the most appropriate way to handle this one is simply to refer to the sort of Civil Aviation Safety Authority regime that the ALP ran and to say that in less than seven years they managed four chairmen, four chief executives and six heads of safety regulation during a period when there were eight ministerial changes. In an environment like that, how you were ever supposed to have a stable, consistent regime within which safety regulators were able to develop seriously thought out, properly coordinated approaches to aviation safety absolutely beggars description. The reality is that in recent times we have managed to address those issues. I do not say, and I never have said, that there is not more to be done in the area of addressing effective cultural change and what have you in CASA, but we are doing a great deal. A period of calm prejudges it. The member for Hotham always knows everything and always manages to look so utterly smug about it! He knows enough: the one honest thing in his GST guide was that he acknowledged, despite what those opposite get up and say in here all the time, that petrol and diesel prices for farmers would come down. It was about the only honest thing in  it.  - And he is being totally relevant, talking about something he knows nothing about! The fact of the matter is that we now have had a considerable period of calm time, when consolidation has been able to be put in place. We have as CEO a tough bloke, a senior pilot and a figure of repute amongst the international industry, with the ability and the knowledge to cut through to the core of an issue. We have replaced a scattergun approach with a measured approach to aviation reform. For example, the unaccountable and unmet - I stress `unmet', severely unmet - surveillance target process of the past was replaced with a quality management approach that is now standard in the world's best and most clearly focused safety organisations. There have been new entrants into the market under this government's aviation reform process. It is worth noting that, unlike what happened when Labor was in power, we now have two new entrants in the aviation commercial sector in this country - two new entrants stimulating further market development in aviation in Australia. They were successfully introduced during 1999 and the year 2000 in a way that ensured that we were able to keep surveillance up. CASA are now in the process of taking on additional skilled staff as part of their restructure, and they have been able to maintain their new quality management approach, which has taken the place of the unmet surveillance targets of old.The other thing that is worth noting is the implementation - after years of struggle when very little was happening, much to the upset of the industry - of a full-scale regulatory reform program. All the regulations, all the processes, are now under active, industry regulated, joint scrutiny. That has now been developed, and the paperwork is with me for final approval. The general spray from the member opposite is without substance. It reflects what I had to say about his performance on regional stuff yesterday: no policies, only carping criticism; never a willingness to acknowledge progress when it is made, only an opportunistic desire to cut down, to be negative, to be inward looking, to be part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. She does indeed have a nuclear reactor in her electorate - something that the Labor Party used to support when they were in government and do not support any more, apparently. Having a nuclear reactor gives us a capacity to understand the nuclear fuel cycle and to contribute very substantially to nuclear arms control and disarmament issues. -  - Your present party has supported it. Your previous party did not, but your present party does -  - Did, not does! I am not sure which party you are going into next. How many parties did Billy Hughes belong to? - Yes, Billy Hughes drew the line. Over the last month, Australia -  -  - The socialists have had a big lunch today, Mr Speaker. - Over the last month, Australia has been very active and constructive in the role it has played in the United Nations to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I am delighted that the Australian-led resolution in support of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was adopted by a larger majority in the United Nations this year than in 1999. It is appropriate that Australia should move that motion. After all, this government was the government that brought the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the United Nations General Assembly and had it voted on by the General Assembly. It is indeed a great achievement for Australia - not just for this government - that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty came into existence. The resolution that was passed through the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly emphatically confirmed strong international support for the CTBT and it does send a clear message about the norms against nuclear testing and that they are here to stay.This year we were also pleased to be able to support a resolution tabled by Sweden on behalf of a group of countries known as the `New Agenda' Coalition. We supported the resolution this year - we had abstained in previous years - because this year the `New Agenda' Coalition worked very closely with governments such as ours in order to redraft the resolution, to make it one that could achieve broader support than has been the case in the past. This particular resolution consolidates support for the positive outcomes of this year's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference and, in doing so, supports key Australian disarmament policy priorities, including the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and universal adherence to and compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This resolution got the support of 146 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and China. It demonstrates the centrality of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the global nuclear non-proliferation disarmament framework. The government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to practical and realistic steps that can lead to nuclear disarmament, rather than pursuing agendas which, frankly, are unrealistic and will never be achieved.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, the Director of Aviation Safety was counselled by CASA after he failed to record a defect in the maintenance release of an aircraft that he had hired - that is true. Needless to say, he is pretty humiliated and somewhat chastened by the experience. He will not be doing it again. I am advised that Mr Toller was dealt with in accordance with CASA's normal compliance and enforcement procedures. I am advised that he was treated in the same way as any other pilot who was privately flying a light aircraft. I emphasise again that, after the performance we have seen in the last couple of years, I regard Mr Toller as a very good Director of Aviation Safety. He has my support. Based on the information that I have at this time, I do not intend to stand him down. Furthermore, I make the comment that those responsible for his employment - the CASA board - yesterday released a short statement in which they expressed their unreserved confidence in Mr Toller.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his deep and abiding interest in wool industry affairs. Yesterday, this House passed the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 and it is now ready to go to the Senate to be considered to implement a new era in services for the Australian wool industry. This legislation has the unanimous support of the wool industry and all the industry organisations. The individual growers voted by way of a Wool Poll to support this kind of reform for their industry. Indeed, it is difficult to recall any circumstances in this troubled industry's history where there has been such united support for reform and a new era for the industry.I was somewhat amazed, therefore, to hear that the opposition are going to oppose and seek to delay this bill. There is no logic to their action in this regard. I think the shadow spokesman, the member for Corio, is actually embarrassed about his party's position on this matter. He knows the right thing to do. He said so several times in his speech to the parliament. I do not like quoting members of the opposition, but in speaking on this bill the member for Corio said:... the opposition understands and appreciates the industry's desire to pass this legislation as quickly as possible through the parliament ...Then, a couple of paragraphs further down, he said: I do note the strong desire expressed to me by wool industry representatives and individual wool growers to forge a new path independent of what they have seen in the past as government interference in their industry ... So the honourable member for Corio knows what the industry wants. He knows what is good for the industry and yet Labor is going to oppose it - opposition for opposition's sake, with no sound fundamental reasons. Perhaps there is a bit of Labor's ideological opposition to the view that industry should take control of their destiny, that farmers should have a say in what services are provided for their industry. There are still a few left on the opposition benches who think that governments know best, that governments, or the ACTU, should make these sorts of decisions and ignore the farmers. It is obvious that the member for Corio, the shadow spokesman, knows what is the right thing to do. Apparently, he got rolled in the caucus by a couple of restless backbench senators who would prefer to play politics than do the right thing. Farm leaders know that there is not much point any more in talking to the honourable member for Corio if they want to learn anything about Labor Party policy on agricultural affairs. They might get a sensible response from him, but he does not speak for the Labor Party when it comes to agricultural issues, some faceless senator does. Someone else will make the decisions. So we have a Labor Party that knows this legislation is good for the industry, a Labor Party that knows the industry wants it and is anxious to have it passed urgently but a Labor Party that is going to do what it possibly can to delay it. That is the sort of irresponsible behaviour that characterised Labor governments in dealing with the wool industry. They were the ones who created most of the troubles that the wool industry now has to recover from. It is about time the Labor Party stood up and explained to the industry and to wool growers why it is going to deny them their cherished ambition to have their new structures in place on 1 January next year. Why is the Labor Party holding it up? What is the reason for the Labor Party denying the wool growers' desire to have this legislation put in place in a hurry? The honourable member for Corio has been humiliated by his own party. Let us hope there is some commonsense soon and that this legislation is passed promptly. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I know he has a very keen interest in generating employment, just as the coalition government does. The preparing for work agreements were an initiative of the Howard-Anderson government which has been extremely successful since it was introduced in October. Since July this year over 200,000 preparing for work agreements have been signed. This means that more people are getting into employment today than they ever did under the stewardship of the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, from the beginning of this year, 80,000 fewer people are claiming Newstart allowance. Why is that? It is because we have generated 800,000 new jobs in the last four years, reducing our unemployment level now to 6.3 per cent, the lowest for many years. The preparing for work agreement does send a very clear message to Newstart recipients and youth allowance recipients that certain obligations and certain assistance programs are available to help them get into the labour market. We are conveying a very powerful message: that the most important thing is for them to gain access to the Job Network and to get a more personalised program.I would like to acknowledge the work Centrelink do. Obviously, Centrelink get no bouquets from the member for Lilley for the work they do on the preparing for work agreements. In the lead-up to and during the Sydney Olympics, they ran a number of expos which over 30,000 people attended. Of those, 20 per cent actually got jobs on the day at the expos. Of course, included in further reforms that we are implementing at the moment are three pilot projects: assisting the mature aged; assisting the long-term unemployed - for whom the member for Bradfield has done an enormous amount of work; and assisting those who work with families. Compare that to the Labor Party's record in government when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment, when Australia's unemployment reached a record level of 11.2 per cent. They allowed people to stagnate. They allowed people to stay on unemployment payments unchecked. Indeed, a lot of social security fraud went unchecked during their stewardship. They did not encourage people to do the right thing and they certainly did not have a preparing for work agreement to outline what was required, particularly to Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients. The biggest lemon of all that they had was Working Nation. What we are on about is providing real jobs and real incentives. Perhaps the member for Dickson could look at getting a few tips on incentives from the AWU or perhaps from her Queensland colleague the member for Lilley. That way, they might be able to boost some more numbers in work rather than trying to boost the Queensland electoral roll. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is: no, I am not because -  -  - I am not aware of it. The answer to the rest of the question is that the legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives is, in my view, a very fair measure and one that ought to be supported in full by the opposition. If you do not accept my view on that, then perhaps the members of the opposition might support the view of the National Council of Independent Schools Association which has addressed a letter to every senator which, amongst other things, says:It is therefore important for this bill to be passed quickly, and the undersigned organisations seek assurances from all senators that the bill will pass through the Senate as soon as possible.That is signed not by John Howard and John Anderson but by Mr Fergus Thompson for the National Council of Independent Schools, the Archbishop of Sydney on behalf of the Anglican Church of Australia, the Association of the Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, the Association of Christian Schools, the Association of Lutheran Schools, the Association of Rudolph Steiner Schools, the Seventh Day Adventist Schools and schools under the jurisdiction of the Uniting Church of Australia. In addition, that letter encloses statements made on behalf of the National Catholic Education Commission. The Rev. Tom Doyle made it very clear yesterday that the National Council of Independent Schools supports the legislation and endorses the Commonwealth's application of the principle of need. These are the words of Tom Doyle, the Deputy Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, who is not a representative of the government but who represents the Catholic education system, which represents the systemic Catholic schools of Australia which, I understand, comprises about 57 per cent of all independent schools. He is speaking in the name of those systemic schools and he is saying that this is a fair bill. You ought to vote for it without amendment and stop playing games with the education future of a million Australian school children. That is what Labor is doing. This is a fair measure. It goes against the ideology of Labor but it is a fair measure. Do not take our word for it. Take the word of the National Catholic Education Commission, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, representatives of the Christian schools and representatives of Lutheran schools. In case the member for Dobell asks a question later about the relative treatment of government schools and non-government schools, let me remind him that in the current - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question and for his strong support for turning workers into owners. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition recycled a 10-month-old furphy and claimed that the government had somehow rigged the Job Network tender process to damage Employment National. How can we want to destroy Employment National when we are actually spending $56 million to support it? Let us scotch this `The government rigged the process' story once and for all. The independent probity auditor said:We have not identified any evidence of systematic bias or lack of objectivity which advantaged or disadvantaged any particular bidder. The secretary of the department of employment said:Neither the ministers nor cabinet sought to influence let alone change any allocation decision that I made.Jobs Australia, which represents some hundreds of employment service providers, said in its annual report just released:Some sections of the media and others pursued conspiracy theories about the demise of Employment National. Was the tender process fair and above board, they asked, and was the minister able to interfere?Jobs Australia concludes:We are confident that the tender process was scrupulously clean. Probity reports and detailed evidence given at Senate estimates hearings have since proved the conspiracy theorists wrong.They are dead wrong. What is actually going on here is that members opposite do not like choice, they do not like competition, and they do not like the Job Network. If the government does not own it and the government does not run it, Labor does not like it. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that Employment National has been unfairly robbed of its contracts, he should state which Job Network members were unfairly given contracts. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and tell the Salvation Army, tell Mission Australia, tell Centrecare, tell Work Directions and tell the Russo Institute that they should not have their contracts. The Leader of the Opposition will never stand up for anything. He is not prepared to own up to the fact that Labor is trying to destroy the Job Network.</DOC>

 - With great respect to the member for Isaacs, she has continued the pattern of questioning and argument that has been adopted by both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dobell which only looks at increases. Almost all of your questions have been based on comparing increases without looking at final outcomes. Self-evidently, if you alter the funding formula, some schools that were classified as, to use your terminology, wealthy under the old index which are not so classified under the new index because the socio-economic mix of their student population justifies a greater level of support, the increase will be greater than it is in relation to those that are already funded at a much higher level. That is a matter of logic. What you really have to do is look at the outcomes and not simply - as you on the other side have relentlessly done, and I think quite wrongly, through the whole of this debate - compare the increases. You do that quite deliberately because it is the only thing that supports your argument. But when you actually look at the outcomes you find it is utterly different. I remind those who sit opposite that when you look at the outcomes under the new formula you will find, as Father Tom Doyle found - who I think knows a little bit more about the needs of independent schools than anybody who sits opposite - that the new -  - Oh, the member for Jagajaga does not think Tom Doyle knows anything about the needs of independent schools. I see. That is very interesting. So Father Tom Doyle does not know anything about -  - And the Leader of the Opposition gets in. He has obviously got me again with this answer; he really has. I remind the member for Isaacs that when you look at the outcome of the new policy - and I think that is what we have to do, we have to look at the outcome - you will find that in the current financial year federal government funding to independent schools means that on average a pupil going to an independent school will be funded at 48 per cent, courtesy of the federal government, of the average cost of educating a child at a government school. Even when the new system which you are so critical of is up and running in 2004, the funding level will be 52.4 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. In other words, for every child that is educated in a private school the federal government on average contributes, under our system, no more than 52.4 per cent. That is the average contribution. What effectively the governments of Australia are doing - principally the federal government but to a small degree the state governments - is supporting the independent sector because the parents of children who go to independent schools make very major contributions to the costs of educating their children. We are relieving the generality of taxpayers, to the tune of about $2.2 billion a year, of school expenditure. One of the most facile features of this whole campaign, based on prejudice and being mounted by the Australian Labor Party, is that they completely ignore the partnership that exists between governments and the parents who make sacrifices to send their children to independent schools. The parents are not only exercising choice in a uniquely Australian way; they are also making a hefty contribution towards relieving the general body of taxpayers from paying something to the tune of $2.2 billion.I say one other thing in relation to the performance of state governments. In the current financial year, the Commonwealth government increased its funding to government schools by a greater proportion than many states and territories. For example, in the current financial year the federal government is increasing its support for state schools, for which state governments have the primary responsibility under historic arrangements endorsed by both sides of politics, by 4.3 per cent. By comparison, in Queensland under the Beattie Labor government, the increase from the state government is 0.8 per cent, and in New South Wales under the Carr government it is only 1.9 per cent. In other words, even in the area where the state government has the primary responsibility, the rate of increase from the federal government is greater for government schools than it is at a state level.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. No doubt he was interested to read, as I was, a statement published today in one of Australia's tabloids, the Financial Review, from the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal. It is headed `Economic freedom has transformed us'. The article begins:One country in the Asia-Pacific region has learned from past mistakes and ... has achieved prosperity that would have been unimaginable years ago.And it is getting recognition for that accomplishment.It goes on:This is Australia's second consecutive appearance among the top 10 of this important barometer of worldwide economic freedom.Interestingly enough, the article makes the point that some of the important reforms to the Australian economy, which occurred on 1 July, were not even taken into account. The article records this:And Australia's index score could rise higher next year, assuming no negative policy changes ... The possible increase might occur as a result of two economic reforms enacted on July 1 ...The first change was an income tax cut that meant 80 per cent of Australian are taxed below 30 per cent or less. The second change was the deregulation of the dairy industry.On that important measure of the freedom index from the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation, Australia is getting recognition for market opening reforms which are creating prosperity. We saw the same thing recently in relation to the competitiveness index - published, I believe, by the World Economic Forum - which showed that Australia had been languishing somewhat in the mid-1990s but that, since the important reforms of 1996 and following, Australia has come into the top 10 in the competitiveness index. What were those reforms?Theywere a proper basis for monetary policy, a fiscal improvement, putting the budget into surplus, paying down Labor Party debt, reforming the taxation system, the privatisation program on Telstra and important industrial relations changes. There is no basis at all, on these international surveys, for Australia to rest - certainly no basis to say that the hard work of reform is over. These are important measures to show that we are now getting some results from the reforms of the past, and it is the reforms of today which will build the prosperity for Australia tomorrow - something which will improve living standards and give more Australians new jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his not altogether unpredictable question. I understand the concern of people in rural, regional and remote areas about the high cost of fuel. I have repeatedly said that we are very keen to ensure they understand that not only do we understand it but we have been active in seeking to address that concern where it is real. The National Party party room has clearly indicated its support for the government's position. We do not believe a freeze is the solution to this very difficult problem which arises fundamentally and primarily and overwhelmingly from very high crude prices internationally and some subsequent downstream effects from very low prices during much of the nineties, inasmuch as refining capacity is limited and even the capacity to move oil around the world in tankers is down at the moment. Those are the fundamental causes of the problem at present.When it comes to being heroes in this place and cowards out there, let me ask those opposite: have they actually been out there - has anyone in the ALP been out there - saying, `We in the ALP did not want you in rural and regional Australia to have all the excise taken off road'? Have they been out there saying that? Have the heroes opposite been out there saying, `We would not negotiate with the government over the removal of 24c a litre on heavy transport fuel'? Have they been out there telling their constituency that? Have they been out there pointing out that they had nothing to do with $500 million that we put in to ease the country-city differential or that they opposed the GST, which of course is rebatable on fuel? Have those heroes opposite been out there reminding people that when it comes to discretionary one-off increases in excise -  -  - Have they! Let me start the question again: have they been out there referring to their 5c a litre increase, which they promised they would not implement in the 1993 budget -  - They do not like this, Mr Speaker. They really do not. Their record is absolutely appalling. So let me ask it again: have they been out there pointing out that in 1993, when they had promised no new taxes, big personal tax cuts and that we did not need a GST, they put 5c a litre extra on -  - They really do not like it. They put an extra 5c a litre on unleaded and 7c a litre on super. Have the heroes been out explaining that? No, they have not. The reality is that they do not want anybody out there knowing that they opposed the removal of $2.2 billion in fuel excise burden on the Australian economy. They do not want anybody knowing that. The fact is that the motion, along with some others, reflected very real concern out there. I am advised that in Parkes, for example, that came from people worried about the cost of getting their children to school. It needs to be put into some perspective. In the last budget, we dramatically improved the cost of accessing education for people in rural and remote Australia. For example, we even removed the assets test on substantial benefits under Family Allowance. I make those points because it brings me to the points of indexation: for every dollar that inflation brings in in extra indexation through fuel, alcohol and tobacco, as is now known, we have to find $2.50 in indexation of benefits that we pay out. That, too, is something that has to be kept in mind. That leads to the next and obvious point: our maintenance of careful budgetary strategy in managing the economy properly is very important indeed. As a group of rural people in my electorate said the other day, `We don't like high fuel prices, but if there is one thing we do not want you to do it is to go back to the ALP's sloppiness in economic management and give us high interest rates again.' The government's position on this is the result of concern for rural people. The evidence for our concern is quite real. It is there for those who want to be honest about it, and our position remains. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am very pleased to inform the House that, at the meeting on Friday of the heads of Australian governments, unanimous agreement was reached to embrace the plan put to that meeting by me on behalf of the Commonwealth government. This represents the most comprehensive attempt ever in the history of this country to tackle what is arguably the most serious long-term environmental challenge, and that is, the degradation of our soil through the process of salinity and the impact that it has not only on the quality of soil and the potential for economic growth and development but also on the quality of our water. At least 2.5 million hectares, which is five per cent of cultivated land, is currently affected by dryland salinity. This could rise to 12 million hectares, or 22 per cent, of cultivated land at the current rate of increase. This would have significant economic, social and environmental consequences for our country.The Commonwealth put on the table a plan to inject $700 million of additional new money into tackling the problem, and I am pleased to say that all of the states of Australia have joined the Commonwealth proposal. They will match us on a dollar for dollar basis. I thank the states, across the party political divide, for the approach that they have taken. There are 20 priority catchment areas which have been identified by the federal government's task force. We have asked our officials to go away and prepare a heads of government agreement, to be signed before the end of the year, to put in place the elements of the strategy. I think this does represent an historic commitment by the governments of Australia to tackling a serious long-term national problem. These are the sorts of long-range views that governments ought to take in the national interest, and I am glad that the premiers responded in such a positive way to the Commonwealth government's initiative.</DOC>

 - Under us, inflation is at very low levels. In contrast to the inflationary regime that those opposite reigned over, fuel excise, under indexation, has risen at very slow rates indeed. When the Labor Party was in power in this country, fuel excise rose by around 5c a litre or so every year on the back of inflation.Government member - Five per cent. - I beg your pardon: around five per cent. We then had discretionary rises over and above it. Our objective is to keep inflation low. That is one of the keys to ensuring that indexation on fuel does not produce the sorts of increases that it did under Labor.</DOC>

 - The answer is that I have - as I imagine all honourable members have - had my attention drawn to it. Let me say at the outset that they are nothing more than allegations. I have no reason to believe that they are anything other than allegations. Incidentally, I share the concern expressed about them by the Queensland Premier. Today I have asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to request the Australian Federal Police to investigate the allegations. I imagine in relation to that I will have the enthusiastic support of the Queensland Premier.In addition, I have written to the Queensland Premier - and I will table a copy of that letter when I finish my answer - drawing attention to and sharing the concerns that he expressed over the weekend regarding the allegations and informing him that I have asked the Minister for Justice and Customs to initiate an Australian Federal Police inquiry. I informed the Queensland Premier that, should it become apparent that cooperation with the Australian Federal Police is not forthcoming, this government is of the view that his government should give urgent consideration to the scope for referring these latest allegations to the Criminal Justice Commission for inclusion in its current inquiry.I am aware of remarks made by the Queensland Premier yesterday that this is not really a matter that is suitable for the Shepherdson inquiry. I ought to point out to him that the Commonwealth and the states do operate joint electoral rolls and that the Shepherdson inquiry, as everyone knows, is currently examining matters relating to inappropriate conduct concerning electoral rolls in the state of Queensland. I therefore hold the view that, in the case of expanding the terms of reference of the Shepherdson inquiry, the reasons are quite compelling. I have further said to the Premier of Queensland that, if his government is unwilling or unable to agree to the course of action outlined in my letter, the Commonwealth itself will be obliged to consider its own powers in relation to conducting an inquiry into these allegations. I table the letter.</DOC>

 - The government's position in relation to this matter is very well known.  -  - It is a very good answer. It is a well and truly road tested answer. I make the point to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that petrol prices are very high at the moment because the world price of crude oil is high. That is the fundamental fact, and that was something that I pointed out to the premiers. The premiers came to Canberra last Friday and they had quite a lot to say about this issue outside the meeting, and they had something to say about it inside the meeting, but at the end of the day the argument that I put was that the current petrol price is overwhelmingly due to the world price. I do not like it any more than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Of course my colleagues do not like it. I understand that. I have had extensive discussions with so many of them about it. Those discussions go on, because this is a consultative, inclusive government. If you are a backbencher in this government you do not have to borrow a Sherman tank to get to see the Prime Minister, which seemed to be the case that applied under former governments, particularly the one that this one replaced. Can I say to all of you that I do not like these high prices any more than anybody else, but they are overwhelmingly due to the world price of oil. The cheap opportunistic behaviour of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition contributes nothing to the betterment of human understanding of the problem.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I was very interested to read the SundayTelegraph on Sunday. It reported a Morgan and Banks survey which had been released last Tuesday, embargoed for Wednesday. The finding in that was that many firms had absorbed some part of the GST and had reported that it had affected their profitability. That was quite consistent with the lower than expected CPI effect of the new tax system and quite consistent with what the government always expected business to do - that was to apply the GST and to make allowances for the savings which would take some time to flow through. That was very good for consumers. Not to be outdone, the old Deputy Leader of the Opposition pounced on this as if it were the best thing that had ever been announced and he has been at it ever since, including saying that this meant that businesses would become unviable and that that would affect employment. He said to David Koch this morning: If profitability is affected, as this survey shows it is, then that affects their viability and that has implications for employment.David Koch asks the perfectly reasonable question: Well what sort of threat do you think it poses to unemployment figures? What could we see them go up by?If 95 per cent of business was unviable and the unemployment rate now is 6½ per cent, what would it go to - 11½, 14½, 15½, 18 per cent? This is the answer he gave: Well, one cannot speculate about that. All we have been saying right along is this. So he is predicting massive unemployment arising from the GST when he is being interviewed by David Koch. He was being completely deceptive because, at the same time that it released that survey, Morgan and Banks also released the survey on employment intentions from the same group of respondents. Here is what the Morgan and Banks' employment intention for business, including small business, reported on Tuesday of last week: `Australia wins gold again', `Record breaking result for job market', `At last, ACT job market on the up'. Another one: `Gold gold, gold - Olympic effort for New South Wales job market'. And `Sun shines on Queensland job market', `South Australian employers break record in Olympian job effort', `Victorian job market set to soar'. Remember, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is quoting Morgan and Banks as saying that unemployment is going to rise. These are the releases that Morgan and Banks actually put out. Let us keep going: `Jobs still high on the agenda for Western Australian bosses', `IT industry breaks all records', `Legal firms break records again', `Engineering jobs wired', `Financial services sector jobs on the money' and `Small business predict record job boom'.So here is a man who will go out on a Sunday and follow it up on a Monday claiming that no less than 10 or 11 or 12 of those press releases indicate that unemployment is on the rise. This is completely deceptive, completely false, the kind of false claim that we are getting used to from the Australian Labor Party. There was a third survey with Morgan and Banks that came out last Tuesday, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition also chooses not to rely upon, because Morgan and Banks went ahead and asked another question. They asked this question: `What do you think of the policy of roll-back?' Morgan and Banks in that same survey - again left out of the Sunday Telegraph on Sunday - answered as follows:A special question formulated for the Morgan &amp; Banks Job Index released today clearly shows that business does not support the ALP proposals to roll back the GST... A resounding 90.5% of businesses indicated - that it should not be put in place. - He says it is repetition. Since that had been reported, since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was out making the totally false accusation that the GST would cost jobs notwithstanding some 10 press releases, he was asked the question by David Koch this morning also: Koch: The same Morgan and Banks survey says business does not want that.That is, roll-back. It continues:The GST is hard. They have to get used to it, but they don't want to go through any more changes.Remember, 90.5 per cent. What do you think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said? He said:Crean: What is the alternative?Koch: A proposition that you have put up is to roll back the GST. The same Morgan and Banks survey says that business does not want that.Crean: But the survey on that point, David, I think asked the wrong question.Oh, it is the wrong question to ask about an ALP policy, isn't it! That is the wrong question, because there aren't any. The question that was actually asked, by the way - this is the wrong question, this is the question you should never ask - is: `Does business support the ALP proposal for the roll back of GST?' That was obviously a skewed question, wasn't it? 90.5 per cent of people said no. Here he was, out there on Sunday, completely misrepresenting all of the evidence on employment. He is asked one question on his policy, he gets a 90.5 per cent fail rate, and that is the wrong question to be asking. No wonder it is the wrong question to be asking, because if the answer ever has anything in it to do with Labor it is a pretty silly question to ask - a very silly question to ask!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, they always fudge a little around the words, because the Nyngan declaration clearly went to the intent of preserving services, which we have -  -  - And I want to make this point. You are not interested in this. The reality is that you do not want to focus on services because we have done more in the last couple of years to increase services in rural Australia that you did in 15. In relation to NDC, let me make a few points. While Telstra is partially government owned, it is an independent corporation and its board and management are responsible for the day-to-day running of that organisation. It is in the context of the board's responsibilities to ensure the company is run in a manner that is in the best interests of its shareholders - that is point one - and that includes decisions about employment matters such as staffing levels. Network Design and Construction Ltd, NDC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra. It is responsible for design and construction of the Telstra network. I note that, in terms of services out there, $500 million a year - just on the standard telephone network - is being expended at the moment to meet new residential and business demand in regional areas. As I say, it does compete on the open market for work from other carriers. I am informed by Telstra that NDC is intending to reduce its staff base from around 6,300 to 5,900 nationally over coming weeks. All but 12 - seven in Perth and five in Adelaide - of the 400 staff affected are voluntary reductions. They are not forced lay-offs, and most of NDC's contracts in Telstra and other works are for work in metropolitan areas, with a lower proportion from rural and regional areas.The other point that I want to make, which anybody genuinely interested in this whole question of rural employment and rural opportunities would acknowledge, is that when it comes to telecommunications the secret is not how many people work for any one given institution at any one time; it is about world-class telecommunications allowing rural and regional Australia to access, if you like, and participate in the emerging industries through what some people euphemistically call `the new economy'. When it really comes to grappling with that issue, it was we, not you, who put in place the Besley inquiry; it was we who through that process have not only had identified the weak links in telecommunications in rural and regional Australia but have given a commitment that we will fix them. You didn't. It is we who have addressed such things as the CSG, the customer service guarantee, that have been put in place by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. All the way through, the evidence is that it is we on this side who take the need for telecommunications at world-class levels in rural and regional Australia seriously, not you. </DOC>

 - I do not accept the charge made either in the article or by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have not, as it happens, read that particular article. I would, however, take the opportunity of reminding the House of the many changes that we introduced as a result of the investigation into administration of small business carried out by Mr Charlie Bell, then the managing director of McDonald's. I would also point out to the House that there are many beneficial improvements in relation to industrial relations reform - and there would have been a lot more if we had not been obstructed in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party and by others. No matter what yardstick you use, the conditions for small business in Australia are infinitely better now than they were in March of 1996. - No, I am not possessed of the arrogance that would ever lead me to make such a statement as that, but there are some people opposite who clearly are. Employment levels are much higher, interest rates are lower, the taxation system is better, the industrial relations system is better, productivity is higher, real incomes are higher, and employers and employees are better off. That is a menu of achievement that the Labor Party can only dream of.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The House will recall that the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme reduced the excise rate on diesel used in heavy transport in regional Australia by 17.8c per litre from July this year. This excise cut, together with input tax credits from the GST, delivers a reduction in road transport diesel costs of at least 24c a litre.  - Did you hear that? The member for Swan - I assume it was over there - asked why diesel is so expensive. I would have thought we had got the message over quite clearly as to why that was. I am glad those opposite guffaw, because I want to make a simple observation. Diesel is the major transport fuel used in Australia, and if the ALP were in power prices would be very, very much higher than they are now. That is a simple statement of fact. They find it funny. What a great sense of humour! The fact is that, whilst fuel price increases may in one sense have masked the effect of these reductions, they have not removed their benefit. In fact, they may have increased their importance.  The ACCC's survey shows that country diesel prices rose by, on average, 16.1c a litre across Australia between June and the last week in September, ranging from a low of 14.9c in Tasmania to a high of 17.3c in country Western Australia. In every state and territory the increase in the pump price was less than the diesel fuel grant. In other words, the diesel fuel grant has fully offset the average price increases over the last three months. In fact, when the additional GST input tax rebate is taken into account, the effective cost of diesel to regional transport operators at the end of September was still, on average, less than they were paying in June.  - Let me find an example. The member for Hotham says, `Oh, they don't believe you.' He is not interested in facts. But I want to put one right before this House that cannot be denied. It is a simple fact - not a matter of conjecture or speculation, just a fact. In Western Australia, where diesel prices at the end of September averaged 113.3c - very high - the effect of GST input credits and the diesel fuel grant would bring the cost of that fuel down to 85.2c a litre, which is more than 10c a litre less than it was before the tax changes were introduced.  - The Treasurer raises the important point. There are people all over the country listening. They will not get the message from the heroes opposite; they are not going to go out there and tell them the truth. I just want to spell this out. If Labor were in power, if Labor's policy were in place, the heavy transport industry in Western Australia would be paying not the current 85.2c a litre but 113.3c. That is what they would be paying. That is a simple matter of fact. Laugh it off all you like, but there is the fact for the Australian users of heavy transport.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Presumably he, like me, noticed a report in the paper over the weekend that Labor have decided to dust off their roll-back policy. It is a little bit surprising. It certainly gathered a lot of dust, because the Leader of the Opposition has not even used the word for over four months. It is especially surprising that they are going to dust off the policy since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not even think anybody should ask questions about it; any question should be out of order. After all, 90.5 per cent of the people do not want it. Nonetheless, somebody in Labor has decided to dust it off, it seems - and it will certainly be a dusty document. I am not quite sure which chapter they are going to dust off. What have farmers and people in rural and regional Australia got to look forward to in relation to the dusted-off roll-back? I am not sure what Labor are going to roll back. There is $1 billion worth of tax cuts for farmers and the rural sector in the new tax system. How much of that is going to be rolled back? I have noticed with interest that the opposition have been interested today in fuel taxes. So, presumably, one of the things they are likely to roll back is the situation in relation to fuel tax rebates. After all, Labor voted against all of those tax rebates. They voted against the diesel fuel rebate, they voted against the alternative grants scheme, they voted against giving rebates on GST for farm and business users and they voted against the $500 million scheme to subsidise petrol and diesel in regional and rural areas. - They voted against all those things. That is what we can look forward to: a roll-back of the rebates, which means higher fuel prices. That is what is on page 1 of the dusted-off roll-back, without any doubt. Presumably they are also going to roll back the income tax cuts which have meant that nearly three-quarters of all primary producers will be paying 20c in the dollar or less income tax this year. Are Labor going to wind back that tax, or are they going to wind back the concessions that were made in relation to asset tests on the youth allowances for farmers and small businesspeople? Is that the sort of thing that is going to be wound back? I think what they will be winding up, irrespective of what they do on roll-back, will be interest rates, because their spending policies will put pressure on the government deficit, and that certainly will mean higher interest rates. - As the honourable member interjects, let us look at where Labor stand on this question of fuel prices. No-one on their front bench has ever denied that Labor policy is still as expressed by the honourable member for Dickson, that fuel rebates are a subsidy on pollution. Is that where your roll-back is going to come: a roll-back in the benefits that have flowed on to businesses, particularly in rural and regional areas? 90.5 per cent do not want there to be roll-back. I notice that Rob Bastian said this morning that small businesses do not take roll-back seriously because they do not know what it is. I think it would be better if Labor left the dust on it, but the reality is that they cannot do that because it is a Labor election promise to roll back the GST. It is high time that they levelled with the people and told us what they are going to cut, what the circumstances are going to be and what changes are going to be made, so that people can then make an intelligent decision about whether roll-back is a good idea or whether it is not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for that question. Friday was a very good meeting, a very interesting meeting, not only in relation to the huge progress that we made in relation to salinity and water quality policies but also for the revealing attitude demonstrated by the premiers - right across the political divide - towards the funding of independent schools under the government's new formula. Perhaps I can best summarise the attitude of the meeting by quoting very briefly from the transcript of the joint news conference. I think joint news conferences are quite a good innovation after Premiers Conference meetings. It tends to bring about a certain level of cross-candour. In answer to a question I had this to say:I don't think it would be, to adopt the Premier's phrase - I was referring to the Premier of New South Wales - unfair of me to say also that nobody criticised the new funding formula for independent schools - nobody criticised the new funding formula, not for independent schools. The next contributor to the dialogue was the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie. He had this to say:The Prime Minister is quite right.Let me repeat that:The Prime Minister is quite right.That was the Premier of Queensland. He said:In fact, I made the point that we didn't want to see one cent go out of any private schools.The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dobell were left like shags on a rock by their Labor Party colleagues. Not one of your Labor Party colleagues criticised the government's independent schools formula. They, along with the independent school leaders, regard it as a fair, just and equitable formula, and the fact that none of them were willing to criticise it, none of them were willing to argue for any change, leaves you without any credibility in relation to your argument.</DOC>

 - I am asked a question about whether I have seen a letter from a member of the public to the tax commissioner. - I am sorry, but the question said from an accountant to the tax commissioner - that is what it said. - Hang on; that was not said in the question. -  - How would you know that if you had not written it for the member? -  - Oh! Isn't that a problem? -  - How come all the frontbench know the details in your own independent question without notice? It wouldn't have been written for you by the tactics committee? `No.' - As regards the business activity statement, can I make this point. The business activity statement is a mechanism for collecting at least seven withholding operations from the tax office: goods and services tax; company tax, now known as pay as you go; prescribed payments system; fringe benefits tax; reportable payments system and a host of others. All collapse down on to one form.The second point I make is this: the Labor Party support the PAYG system. To have a PAYG system, you need a BAS return. It is the point that I made before the last election. When the Labor Party jumped up and said, `We're in favour of PAYG,' I made this point. I think you now understand what I was saying. To have a PAYG system, you needed a BAS; you needed a reporting system which was required for GST without the GST. That is, to run a PAYG system you have to get sales and expenses for the quarter. As it turns out, the sales and the expenses for the quarter allow you to calculate GST. But, if you did not have a GST, to run a PAYG system you would still have to have a BAS. The point I made before the last election was that the Labor Party, by supporting PAYG, supported a BAS whether or not they had a GST - a whole system premised on a GST, which they adopted the tail end of and which required the BAS accounting retirements. As the first quarterly BAS is being returned by 11 November - which has been an extension of time, and an additional extension of time for those agents who lodge 50 per cent of their requirements, together with an assurance from the Commissioner of Taxation that those who honestly and genuinely fill them in will not be subject to penalties - it being the first return, of course people will have to get used to it. We have never made any pretence about that. Will the sky fall in? The sky will no more fall in than it did with the 1 July prophecies about the sky falling in. We have seen these kinds of scare tactics all along. The problem for the Labor Party is this: you cried wolf. You cried wolf on 1 July: you said that the world was going to end, and it did not. Then, lo and behold, after the consumer adjusts to the GST, what do the Labor Party then say? They are in favour of keeping the system! After small business adjusts to the BAS, what will the Labor Party say? Let me make this prediction: if a Labor Party ever got elected, do you think the BAS would be withdrawn? Would it?Government members - No. - Absolute silence from the Labor Party. Again, here we have the time honoured tactic of the Labor Party -  `Whilst we can complain, whilst we make false accusations, whilst we will do everything we can to try and besmirch and cause confusion, would we ever do anything about it? No.' The difference between the government and the Labor Party is not that the Labor Party would abolish the BAS; that is not the difference. It is not that the Labor Party would abolish the PAYG system; that is not the difference. It is not that the Labor Party would abolish GST and reintroduce wholesale sales tax; that is not the difference. The difference between the government and the Labor Party is that one political party in this country can lead and the other can only follow. -  - It can only follow. The Labor Party never had the guts to do tax reform. They said that if it were introduced they would repeal it. Now they want to keep it - because all they can ever do is follow; they can never lead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. The Labor Party has at last indicated what amendments it intends to introduce to the government's schools funding legislation. I think it is fair to say that, following that embarrassing press conference at which the member for Dobell could not even remember what ERI stood for, the Labor Party's policy has been universally condemned. The Association of Christian Schools has said:The existing ERI - which does not stand for expenditure resource index; it stands for education resource index. The member for Dobell might like to remember that - system of funding non-government schools lacks transparency, has a flawed methodology and does not deliver justice. The National Council of Independent Schools Association said about the Labor Party's amendments:They are based on no research, no analysis of the impact of the proposed amendments, no consultation with schools or their peak bodies, no understanding of how the old ERI funding schemes locked schools into the wrong funding category. This proposal by Labor is arbitrary and unfair.The Independent Schools Association went on to remind the Labor Party that independent analysts from KPMG exposed the ERI as being shot through with flaws. KMPG said:The ERI fails to meet most of the tests of an effective indicator of need.And this is what the Labor Party wants to use as the basis for school funding. It is worth remembering the words of Dr Peter Tannock, the Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, on 18 October:... under the legislation, additional funding will flow to many small and struggling non-government schools serving needy communities. This is a highly commendable outcome. The NCEC recommends that the Commonwealth parliament pass the legislation as soon as possible.Peter Crimmins, the Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools says:SES funding - socioeconomic status, not State Emergency Service, for the benefit of the member for Dobell - will deliver justice to Christian schools serving Australia.Under Labor's proposal, the Warwick School of Total Education in Queensland, which is a school assessed as serving a community needier than the average parish school but which happens to be in category 1, would have its funding frozen by the Labor Party at $1,161 per student, while Birchgrove community school in New South Wales, which is assessed as serving one of the most well-to-do communities, would continue to receive $5,100 per student. That is an example of the injustices which are perpetuated by the appalling policy announced by the Labor Party at that embarrassing press conference. As the National Council for Independent Schools said, the SES model is the best and fairest system so far devised for funding non-government schools. It deserves a fair go. This government will restore justice to funding for non-government schools. The Labor Party has nothing to offer but injustice.</DOC>

 - Even for the standards of the opposition, that is an extraordinary piece of flawed logic. It is not a question of congratulating myself or congratulating the government; it is a question of congratulating the community. Once again, the community has demonstrated something I have always believed: if you put a proposition to the Australian public and argue it, if that proposition is in Australia's interests and is fundamentally fair, the Australian community will get behind it. The new tax system has been embraced by people far more than the Labor Party hoped and prayed would be the case. The Labor Party really wanted it to be a disaster so that they would surf to victory. Every member who sits opposite must still remember the words of the Leader of the Opposition at the caucus meeting in December last year when he said: `Don't worry about alternative policies. We are going to surf to victory on the back of public discontent in relation to the new tax system.' That is the politics of cheap opportunism. Oppositions can play that game, just as they are playing the politics of cheap opportunism in relation to petrol,  - But, in the end, the reality of a situation and the reality of good policy will find you out. The GST implementation has gone better than I thought it might and far better than the Labor Party hoped it would. I thank and congratulate the people of Australia for embracing so wholeheartedly a long needed, much needed and very beneficial reform for the future of Australia's economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby, and I acknowledge his interest, as a South Australian, in the car industry. Can I inform the House that the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has released its retail report, which is known as VFACTS. It showed that for October 2000, industry volume of 67,642 new vehicles is up by 6,386 vehicles or 10.4 per cent on October of the year before. The October 2000 market was an all-time record for October. This follows on from other recent sales figures: for July, up by 26 per cent on the previous year; for August, up by 21 per cent; and, for September, up by 13.5 per cent. For the September quarter, sales were up 17.3 per cent, which is good news for motor vehicle sales. One of the main reasons for that is that cars became cheaper under the new tax system. There will be further good news when input tax credits start coming in for business; it will become cheaper still for business to buy cars. Of course, if tax reform had been defeated, Australians would still be punished by having higher car prices - including families, who would be paying more for cars under Labor Party policy.Members of this House will recall that there were many Labor Party members who said that the price of cars would never fall - another one of those claims that the Labor Party was prepared to falsely put out until the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found that prices fell by six per cent with the introduction of the new tax system. The member for Kingston was one of those, confidently predicting on 5DN that people had been told erroneously that the price of cars would fall - the vigneron himself. The opposition spokesman for industry claimed on 8 May that it was a myth that cars would be cheaper after the GST. But the prize for the falsest accusation was won by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition told the Australian people on 4 June 1999: I don't believe any prices are going to fall when the GST comes into play.None! They are out this week talking about the BAS: `The world's going to fall in!' We will see if the world is still here next Monday. They were out before 1 July 2000 saying that everything was going to be put out of the reach of everybody. The question now is: under roll-back, will the price of cars be going up or down? It is a very good question. Under roll-back, what will happen to the price of cars? It is a pretty obvious question. The Leader of the Opposition is absolutely committed to roll-back, so he could possibly tell us what the tax treatment of cars will be under roll-back. I cannot believe that, having fought the GST as long and as hard as he has, he has not actually come to grips with what he intends to do about it. I keep saying in this House that the last time he mentioned roll-back in relation to tax policy was 19 July 2000, when he was speaking to the AMWU conference in Newcastle. They always tell the truth when they are down at the union conferences! This is what he said:I can tell you today that we won't be moving a millimetre from our stance of rollback ... -  - No, he did not say, `We won't be moving a millimetre towards roll-back.' It was, `We won't be moving a millimetre away from our stance of roll-back.' If you are not moving a millimetre, announce what you are going to do with the taxation treatment of cars, tell us how much it is going to cost, tell us what is going to happen to the price and, most of all - this is what the people of Australia really want to know - tell us how you are going to fund the roll-back, what the increase in income tax is going to be, what the increase will be as against the budget and where that is going to end up in relation to interest rates. This is a totally populist opposition which can do only one thing if it wants to get a shred of credibility: come out and announce your policy, tell people what you have in mind and don't run away from your own policies. </DOC>

 - The answer to -  - It's all right. It was a very good interjection. I don't mind being denied -  - It had a great deal of resonance with me, and he can come to Bennelong any time he likes! The answer to the first part of the question is: yes, I am aware of that letter circulated by the Society of St Vincent de Paul. I share with them and many other organisations a concern about gaps that exist within Australian society. Some of those gaps are things that can be effectively addressed by governments. One of the best ways of addressing gaps between different groups in Australian society is to generate more jobs. The greatest thing you can do for a low income family on welfare is to ensure that mum or dad or both have a job. There are now 840,000 more people in work as a result of the policies of this government than there were when we came to office. As to the second part of the question, yes I am aware of that legislation. My understanding is that what that legislation has done is, in fact, to tighten the eligibility. I also understand that it tightens an eligibility that has existed for some time. I will check my understanding, but I have an idea that it is an eligibility that may well have obtained when the Labor Party was in office. - Oh, only for 13 years. I will check to see if that is right because I do not claim to carry all these details around in my mind and if I am wrong I will be only too ready to acknowledge it. But if my understanding is correct, what the member for Lilley is saying is, `It is okay for the Labor Party to allow something like this to go on for 13 years but because you, who have come in and decided to make it fairer, do not make it fairer straight away and you allow a year for people to adjust, you are wrong and the Labor Party is right.' - In Queensland they used to call him a political strategist. Maybe there were other reasons. If he applied the logic to his campaigning that he applied to that question, no wonder they lost so many seats a few years ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Since coming to government in 1996, we have addressed a number of chronic problems with Medicare, rather than relaxing into smug complacency as the Labor Party was prepared to do. We have addressed the issue of chronic underfunding of our public hospitals. We have addressed the open-ended nature of the Medicare rebates. We have addressed issues of chronic illness, which Medicare previously did not. We have also addressed the issue of private health insurance, which was an integral part of the original formulation of Medicare.It is estimated that this year the Commonwealth government is putting an extra $1.3 billion into public hospitals over and above 1997-98, which was the last year of Labor's health care agreements. So over a five-year period funding in real terms will go up around 25 per cent - an unprecedented increase in public hospital funding to the states. In terms of the open-ended nature of Medicare outlays, we have signed agreements with general practice, pathology and radiology. That means that 60 per cent of Medicare is now effectively under a soft cap and manageable in agreements with the profession. This is a major achievement that gives government some control of outlays and some control of quality. In relation to chronic illness, Medicare allowed Australia to be 68th in the world for childhood immunisation, with a completed childhood immunisation rate of 53 per cent. This has now been fixed, and enhanced primary care item numbers mean that Medicare can look at preventative issues and chronic illness in a way it never has before. But probably our biggest success has been with private health insurance. We have addressed a 15-year decline in private health insurance and brought it back to levels over 40 per cent to give the public some real choice. It is interesting, though, that this being the government's greatest achievement, it is very hard to find out where Labor stands on this issue. Six weeks ago we did have a statement at a doorstop but we have had no subsequent press release, no follow-up statement and no clarification of any outstanding issues. We found out why on the weekend in the Sydney Morning Herald. Alan Ramsey, when talking about the steamrolling of the shadow minister for health, the member for Jagajaga, stated:There was a deal of wink, wink soft soap as well to dampen dissent. That is, look, the first essential is for Labor to get back into government. Once there, well, then Labor can redress some of these issues. The issue Mr Ramsey is talking about is the roll-back of the 30 per cent rebate by the Labor Party. We know the Labor Party has never supported the 30 per cent rebate. The shadow minister for health put out 31 press releases which were highly critical of it. The Labor backbench has made comments - for example, the member for Swan talked about it as one of the most offensive packages of legislation ever seen in this nation; the member for Sydney - `hardly money well spent'; and the member for Paterson - `We've seen one of the greatest bits of waste in this country that has ever been presented to it by an irresponsible government.' Yet this is an issue that the Labor Party simply cannot clarify itself on. It thinks it can sneak along until the next election, sneak back into office and then roll back the 30 per cent rebate. The fact is, very simply, the public will not allow the Labor Party to do this. The Labor Party has no credibility whatsoever on private health insurance, and it stands condemned for its obfuscation on this issue.</DOC>

 - The opposition has taken a press release totally out of context. I never said that. Indeed, Centrelink, like the former Department of Social Security since the 1970s, has a policy of referring people to charitable organisations. That was at the request of charities. The reason for that is to ensure that those individuals who are suffering hardship have exhausted their Commonwealth entitlements. A reference letter is generated to those charities to ensure that those entitlements are exhausted. Most people are referred to charities at times of hardship, maybe because of a crisis. Indeed, February is a very busy time for charities, when expenses hit families after Christmas. Requests are usually for food vouchers or other items. Centrelink does provide an enormous amount of assistance, in particular emergency payments and crisis payments. Where you get your lines from is totally incorrect, but I suspect that you are referring to a regional office that had a visiting service a few years ago. Centrelink has established a fully-fledged office in a regional centre which now has five employees, where previously no employees were provided by the former Department of Social Security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and acknowledge the great interest he has shown in the whole issue of the Solomon Islands over the last few months. On 15 October, the Townsville agreement was signed. It was an important step towards resolving the problems of the Solomon Islands. Subsequent to the Townsville agreement, the New Zealand foreign minister, Mr Goff, and I sent a joint team to Honiara to investigate how best we might help with the Solomon Islands proposal to set up an International Peace Monitoring Team.Today I announced that the Peace Monitoring Team will be led by an experienced officer from my department, Mr Simon Merrifield. He departs for the Solomon Islands tomorrow. Four Australian team members, one from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and four from Department of Defence - five altogether - are already on the ground preparing for the arrival of their colleagues. The bulk of the monitors will arrive on Thursday, 9 November to ensure they are there well before the 14 November deadline for the weapon surrender set by the Townsville agreement. By 11 November, there should be 30 Australians and New Zealanders on the ground. The first full rotation of 49 Australian and New Zealand peace monitors will be in the Solomon Islands by early December. The peace monitors will be drawn from the Australian Federal Police, from the New Zealand police and defence forces and from Australian and New Zealand government departments. The Australian Defence Force will provide logistics support for the mission.The international monitors will support the indigenous Solomon Islands Peace Monitoring Council and its network of peace monitors. Their role will be to oversee the disarmament process and to raise community confidence. The Australian and New Zealand monitoring team will be completely neutral, having been deployed at the invitation of all of the main parties to the ethnic tension and in line with Australia's policy of supporting indigenous solutions to the Solomon Islands conflict. I am sure all members of the House will join me in wishing the monitors well in their very important assignment.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - It is often not what is said but what is not said. Yesterday afternoon after question time the Leader of the Opposition issued a media release on health insurance. I am delighted that, finally, the opposition has been able to put out something on the coalition's 30 per cent rebate, although it is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition had to do it and that the shadow minister for health still has not issued any press release or statement on the 30 per cent rebate. The Leader of the Opposition said this:... I have made clear that Labor will retain the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, with no means test or cap.I do not apologise for warning people about the threats to the coalition's 30 per cent rebate posed by a Beazley Labor government. I am glad to hear that they do not intend to impose a means test or a cap. But what one has to look at is the Labor Party's record on this issue. In early August, on Sunday Sunrise, the shadow minister for health attempted to convince Glenn Milne that the 30 per cent rebate was going to stay. She reiterated this several times while, at the same time, people were being briefed that Labor were going to change it and that their policy process was certainly looking at chopping the 30 per cent rebate. We still do not have any detail on how the Labor Party would address the coalition's 30 per cent rebate. The Leader of the Opposition has specifically failed to rule out the following: excluding ancillaries from the rebate so that the rebate would be paid only on premiums for hospital cover; excluding health insurance products with high front-end deductibles; making ineligible those products with exclusions; introducing some form of grandfathering, which is a very real possibility, so that the rebate would apply only to existing fund members, not new fund members; paying the rebate only on the base rate premiums; or imposing a GST on health insurance premiums to pay for their roll-back of the GST. So there are six possible things that could still be introduced under the Leader of the Opposition's so-called denial.We know that the Australian Health Insurance Association has been trying to get information out of the Labor Party since February. They wrote to the Leader of the Opposition in February, asking him what his plans for the coalition's 30 per cent rebate were, but they did not get a reply. They wrote again in June, but they did not get a reply. They wrote again in August, but they did not get a reply. They wrote again in September, but they did not get a reply. They wrote a fifth time to the Leader of the Opposition attempting to get something in writing and, in the first couple of days of this month, they are waiting for a reply. I have to tell them that I would not be too optimistic if I were they. If the Leader of the Opposition is serious about retaining the coalition's 30 per cent rebate in its current form, then, at the end of question time, he will put on the public record what Labor's plans are. He will rule out the six possible things that could still be tampered with, which would destroy the essential nature of the rebate. If he does not, every Australian will know what he is up to. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. As he knows, the first quarterly business activity statement is due in on 11 November, which I believe is Friday. - The member for Hunter must have had another generous lunch, like his father before him. It is due in on 11 November, which I believe is Friday. -  - One of the options available to small businesses remitting on a quarterly basis is the derived from accounts method, which is available for people who take their GST off a computer program or from accounts otherwise, which produces the actual GST payable on sales with the credits from GST which has already been paid in respect of supplies received. Businesses that use the derived from accounts method are able to take just the amount payable on sales, the credit from what they have paid on their inputs, and remit the difference. The business activity statement also asks about total sales, exports, GST for supplies and acquisitions, but only for the purposes of national accounts. They can be taken directly off the accounts without filling in the whole of the calculation sheet. I was also asked about alternative tax policies in relation to GST and the business activity statement. I made the point yesterday, and I will make it again, that the Australian Labor Party - notwithstanding the fact that it would like to try and use the business activity statement for more illegitimate and populist complaints - actually supported the introduction of the PAYG system. The PAYG system requires a business activity statement to work. I was rather amused by the last question that was asked of the Prime Minister, on record keeping, because when the Australian Labor Party supported PAYG, it actually supported it as a measure to cut business paperwork. The Australian Labor Party would now stand up and say, `What are you doing to cut business paperwork? Look how bad the BAS is.' The Australian Labor Party's policy is to support the BAS as a paperwork reduction measure. I take that from the policy of the Australian Labor Party before the last election - `A fairer tax system with no GST'. The Australian Labor Party, when it supported the introduction of PAYG and the BAS, said: Employers will still act as collectors of taxes under the new withholding arrangements. These will be integrated into the quarterly remittence schedule applying under the PAYG. - This is your policy! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects in a rather animated way! This is your policy! This is what the Labor Party said when it was supporting the introduction of PAYG. It said it would support the introduction of PAYG and the BAS and that, `This move will facilitate a reduction in paperwork.' The Labor Party policy was to support the introduction of PAYG and BAS `to facilitate a reduction in paperwork and hence compliance costs'. - The poor old Deputy Leader of the Opposition now complains about his own policy which he had before the last election to reduce paperwork. It is another example of an opposition which has no principle, which is buffeted by populism, being prepared to campaign against itself to make these illegitimate complaints.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. The schools funding legislation, which is now in the Senate, is the largest single investment in government and non-government schooling that has ever been made by a federal government. The legislation is supported by all major religious groups and all major ethnic communities in Australia. It is supported throughout rural and regional Australia and by all organisations representing non-government schools, which have worked for years to put in place a fair and objective measure upon which school funding can be based.It is fair to say that school communities around Australia are watching with disgust and growing anger as the Labor Party and the Democrats toy with their future, throwing around ill-considered amendments that would politicise school funding and damage education. The Democrat amendments announced yesterday would cut some $285 million out of school funding next year. For all we know, the Labor Party may well support those amendments. The amendments are so ill-considered that the Democrats are calling for the states to register all schools before they receive Commonwealth funding - a measure that has been in place for years. No school receives funding unless it is registered by a state government.The Labor Party only wants to cut funding to a particular group of schools - a group of schools that includes many serving low to moderate income communities. For example, I notice that Minimbah Primary School, in the electorate of the member for Dunkley, has written to Labor members urging them to visit the school before they slash its funding. Under Labor's policy Minimbah would receive $595 per pupil. Under the coalition's policy, it would get $2,340 per pupil, much less than the government school down the road but nevertheless a very significant increase in funding. The Labor Party want to slash this school's funding because it is a school in category 1. Nobody could say that this school serves a wealthy community. It shows the complete bankruptcy on which the Labor Party's amendments are based.These funding cuts would be repeated across Australia if the Labor Party and the Democrats had their way. What strikes you about these amendments coming from the other side of the House is the sheer arrogance of those who claim that they know better the interests of those in the non-government sector than those in the sector itself, which supports the legislation. Nobody except the Labor Party and their usual cohort of 120 celebrity supporters opposes the government's legislation. I looked at the list of 120 celebrities who have apparently come out in support of the Labor Party's view. Many of the names on this list look strangely familiar: Sharan Burrow - Shazza is there, the President of the ACTU; Denis Fitzgerald - Dezza is there as well - the head of the Australian Education Union; two discredited and failed Labor premiers, John Cain and Joan Kirner; and a host of the usual suspects - a swag of ABC journalists, commentators and actors. I also counted five comedians on the list. However, the prize for the over-the-top arrogant comment about this legislation must go to former Family Court judge John Fogarty on Radio National this morning. The bill is the largest school funding bill for government and non-government schools ever to go through the federal parliament but, according to Judge Fogarty, the bill will `entrench marriage breakdown, child abuse and long-term unemployment'. We should be grateful that it is not causing disease or making Australia a target in nuclear war! This is how nonsensical the debate has become. It is time for the Labor Party and the Democrats to stop these arrogant and insulting manoeuvres. The Senate should get on and pass this bill as soon as possible in the interests of all government and non-government school students in Australia.</DOC>

 - I do not condone medical fraud in any form whatsoever. I cannot give them to you off the top of my head, but if you want to have a look at the figures I am happy to provide them to the House later on, because I did ask for them previously. The fact is that the amount of money recovered for Medicare fraud in real terms is up in the four years of this government compared with what the Labor Party did in the 13 years they were in office. So we have acted far more swiftly and more toughly on medical fraud than the Labor Party ever did.The second point is that the Health Insurance Commission's investigative powers grew out of changes to the act by the Labor Party because the Federal Police were deemed not to be an appropriate body to look into this highly technical area. So the Health Insurance Commission was taking over a police power. At the time, it was seen as quite inappropriate for a minister to get involved. Given that the Health Insurance Commission has been able to recover more money under Medicare fraud in the four years I have been health minister, I have absolutely every confidence that it will deal with this properly, and that it is dealing with it more vigorously than ever happened while Labor were in office.</DOC>

 - I am thrilled to be able to tell the honourable member that this historic piece of legislation passed through the Senate yesterday. It passed through with no thanks to the Labor Party, who moved a series of amendments that would have made the bill completely unworkable and would have circumvented the aims of the original piece of legislation. I am pleased, though, to be able to say that the Australian Democrats supported the bill and it passed through unchanged. This is an enormously important piece of legislation that, from next year, will mean another 100 places in Australian medical schools for people who are committed to rural Australia. This will be ongoing - these 100 places will be provided each and every year. Within 10 years there will be a thousand people in the pipeline bonded to serve rural Australia.  - The member for Paterson, with his corny interjection, actually makes a point that is worth talking about. In the last budget we provided $562 million over four years to address the rural health needs of country Australians. Spending next year will be of the order of $300 million a year - up from $100 million a year when we came into government. It takes short-, medium- and long-term solutions to fix this problem. We have put the short-term solutions in place with rearranging general practice training. We have put medium-term solutions in place with the John Flynn scholarships, HECS exemption and a variety of other mechanisms. This is a long-term solution. If someone had put in it place 10 years ago we would not have nearly the problem we do today. I make no apologies for trying to put in place a long-term solution to a very long-term problem.  - Labor would like to take credit for this, but nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that the Labor Party was proposing a scheme whereby doctors would be under no compulsion to actually work in rural areas. Some medical specialties earn very large amounts of money by community standards. People in some medical specialities in their early years out can earn $300,000 to $600,000 or $700,000 a year. A six-year bond at $20,000 a year or somewhere between $150,000 and $180,000 is not going to hold in the country someone who can earn $300,000 to $600,000 in their first year out. It is patently absurd. This innovative way of dealing with it through a Medicare provider number means that next year the Canberra medical school will get an additional 25 places and other medical schools will get between five and 10 places. People who are committed to country areas will find it easier to get into medical school, and we will be well on the way to fixing a very long-term problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question because it allows me to correct some of the misinformation that he has been peddling out there. Firstly, it is not the government that sets this entitlement. The member for the Northern Territory would well know that this is a responsibility of the command within the Australian Defence Force.  - Let me also say that neither the intent nor the spirit of the entitlement has been changed. - The force member's entitlement for remote locality leave travel is an airline ticket to the nearest capital city within Australia and has not been a sum of money. I am sure that you have been informed that that is what the entitlement is. It is not a sum of money; it is an airline ticket. I am surprised that this question has passed the Leader of the Opposition's office because he is a former defence minister and would well know how the entitlement operates. Defence have arranged a contract with Qantas for travel. Through this process Defence pay no more than 68 per cent of the standard economy airfare. Therefore, this has become a normal part of departmental liability when members choose to offset the remote locality leave travel to travel by other means or to alternative destinations. The remote locality leave travel has generally been subject to FBT since 1986. The member for the Northern Territory has been in contact with my office. We have provided him with the information, and his misinformation is still being peddled out there. He ought to get himself across the issue. The remote locality leave travel entitlement has not changed and it is not the government that sets the entitlement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. As suggested in her question, next week I will be visiting North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. This is part of a general process of dialogue and engagement with North Korea that this government began a little over a year ago. Also, the government has been very impressed with the momentum of broader engagement with North Korea that has been taking place. We have seen the North host the landmark Korean leaders summit and North Korea join the ASEAN Regional Forum at its meeting in July. Members will be aware that US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, visited Pyongyang last month and there is a possibility that President Clinton will visit soon as well. I also note that the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands recently announced that they would establish or restore diplomatic relations with North Korea.Much of what has happened on the Korean Peninsula in recent times is due to the efforts of the South Korean President, Kim Dae Jung, who has been acknowledged for his work with a Nobel Peace Prize. This government has, right from the beginning, given strong support to Kim Dae Jung's `sunshine' policy. It is a policy that has not always been popular in South Korea, but he was prepared to stick with it even when it was not popular, and it has turned out to be, I think, profoundly successful.Let us not forget that the process of engagement does have a long way to go. During my visit I will be trying to push the process forward. We are working with other countries, including the United States, to encourage North Korea to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency to remove concerns about its nuclear ambitions. We also want North Korea to come to a settlement that deals comprehensively with the threat its missiles pose to the region and to the broader nonproliferation regime. I will also take the opportunity of discussing North Korea's humanitarian problems because North Korea does face chronic food shortages. To help, the Australian government has contributed about $23.4 million to UN led emergency appeals since the financial year 1996-97.I think this policy of engagement with North Korea is one well worth our while pursuing in the interests of stability in the Asia-Pacific region. A number of other countries are pursuing the same policy. Whilst there is a great deal of distance to cover yet before we feel fully comfortable with what is happening in North Korea, all of us in this parliament can take comfort from the progress that has already been made.</DOC>

As he well knows, the operational management of the Australian Federal Police is a matter under the control of the Australian Federal Police. In determining where to allocate their resources, they have regard to the demands and to the priorities, and any decision taken to allocate or reallocate resources is a matter for the AFP. It is not subject to political decision making or interference. In this case I understand that the priorities have been determined by the AFP and there is no need for that unit to be continuing as a separate unit.

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her very keen interest in this matter. I remind the House that last week we discussed the ACCC price surveys, which were a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the GST on prices after 1 July. At that time we were looking for similar surveys across the Labor Party frontbench. We found one at the web site of the member for Lilley. I think we all remember that. - Oh, I am wrong! The member for Lilley stood up after question time and said, `In fact, we have done an August survey,' and he waved around a newsletter, which was not on his web site. Why would the member for Lilley not even seek to table the newsletter? I just happen to have come across a copy of the newsletter and, lo and behold, the price survey is not on the first three pages; it is on page four of the newsletter. I had a look at the survey and, in fact, there are figures for August. As you pan down the list of supermarkets, there are 28 supermarkets listed with information provided by 27. Of the 27 supermarkets surveyed in the electorate of Lilley, 26 were cheaper after the introduction of the GST. So Franklins, Woolworths, Hypermarket, Bi-Lo and Coles were all cheaper after the introduction of the GST. What a surprise that the member for Lilley did not want to table it in the House! What a surprise that the member for Lilley did not put it up on his web site! When you look down the list, you find there is one supermarket where prices have increased after the introduction of the GST. It is located in Nundah, which is right around the corner from the member for Lilley's electorate office. It is called Food For Less - in fact, it should be `Food For More' but it is Food For Less. The interesting thing is that the survey is run by the member for Lilley. There are his mates in Queensland - the mates who are giving evidence before the CJC - and you can just imagine one of his mates coming into his office and the member for Lilley saying, `Can you go down to Food For Less and do a survey?' Of course, he goes down to Food For Less and, as his previous instructions have been `Just add a few extra digits', on this occasion he added a few extra digits. So Food For Less turns out to be more expensive than every other supermarket in Lilley. The Labor Party has been hoist on its own petard here. In the words of the member for Lilley, after the GST has been introduced, the people living in his electorate are better off than they were before the GST. Mr Speaker, I am happy to table the newsletter. If you do not mind the annotation here, `Swan is a goose', I am happy to table it. </DOC>

 - The first point that I would feel obliged to make in this place is that I really just cannot afford to take at face value any claim made by somebody from the opposite side in relation to the speculation - the second point - about changes in the way Telstra run and where they run their call centres. Telstra have made it plain that they regard rural and regional areas as often very attractive to run call centres from and have not given any clear indication to me, or to anybody else that I am aware of, of where they will go in net terms. But they have made it plain that there is likely to be an expansion in the attractiveness of call centres being placed in rural and regional areas. When you talk about the telecommunications industry looking at something like a $3 billion investment in infrastructure in rural and regional and remote Australia and when you look at how anyone with even a basic understanding of the future for rural and regional Australia -  - And jobs as the member for Dickson keeps interjecting - you would know full well that the key to it is world-class telecommunications. That is what it is all about. That is where the jobs are being generated. That is where they will be in future. If the ALP had its way as far as rural and regional Australia is concerned, we would still be living in the days of stagecoaches and `Your three minutes are up, sir; are you extending?' approaches to telephone calls. That is where you would have us - you really would. The reality is that we need cost-competitive, world-class telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. In the end, that is where the best opportunities for maximising jobs and investment in rural and regional Australia will come from in the future. </DOC>

 - I can advise the House that that quote is completely accurate and no-one needed to fake the letterhead or the words that are contained therein! It again raises the issue of truth in labelling regarding the true status of a political party that still masquerades under the name of Labor. We have all these scare stories coming out, with fake letters and fake letterheads; that was said by somebody who represents the workers and who has made it clear that it is this side of the House that is acting in their interest. Both the member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Gilmore will also be delighted to know that their active representations on behalf of their workers in their electorates have now succeeded in getting agreement between me and the New South Wales government in regard to the last regional forest agreement in that state - the southern region. The long and drawn out negotiations delivered another 6,000 cubic metres of sawlog to the industry, and that represents 100 workers who would otherwise have been sacked. We know very well that that is not of concern to the people on the other side. There has not been one criticism of Premier Beattie buying two sawmills with taxpayers' money for one reason and one reason only - to sack the 100 workers that were employed there. The same members and all those other members of this side of the House that come to me with representations on behalf of workers in forest industries will also be pleased to know that last week was the first meeting of the Action Agenda's Forest Products Advisory Council attended by, amongst others, a representative of the CFMEU - and a very great contribution was made. That body will of course be passing on through me to the ministerial council meeting to be held this Thursday night their views and their support -  - for a national forestry standard and for better control of our forests so that we do not see another million acres burnt out as has happened in New South Wales this year. Finally, we will spend a lot of time talking about getting pulp and paper mills back into Australia and cooperating with the states, doing all the environmental inquiries now so that we do not have another farce like that that occurred in Tasmania, where the Labor government did not have the wit to overcome the problems that have arrived there environmentally. All they wanted to do was get scientists to prove why we could not have that facility. We find people complaining we have not got enough paper in this country when, through Labor's own actions, workers were denied jobs and people who require paper have to import it from other countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It reflects the fact that the opposition's MPI is on this today, run by the member for Paterson over there. Presumably they have noted that today is Melbourne Cup day and have chosen a day when rural and regional issues, which they apparently seek to highlight today, will not really be the focus of a great deal of attention, which I think reflects pretty accurately Labor's concern for rural and regional Australia. There they were at their national conference in Hobart, and so important was rural and regional Australia to the ALP that the Leader of the ALP could not even mention rural and regional and remote Australia. But then he does, of course, have his two secret weapons, the two ex-ACTU presidents, who are his `mechanism', if you like - the two `popular' people in rural Australia that are going to win the bush back! The question is absurd, really.There was a question a moment ago about Telstra. One of the useful things that we have been able to do in relation to telecommunications policy was to set up something that the ALP never did, and that was to set up the RTIF, Networking the Nation. The member for Fraser described the RTIF as `nothing more than a slush fund'. The Labor shadow minister Stephen Smith referred to the projects as `bribes for the bush'. These are not actually particularly old quotes like the ones we heard a few moments ago from people like the member for Groom. It is interesting that when the Leader of the Opposition finally got out into regional Australia, he wandered into the Portside Online centre in Tasmania -  - and he said:I haven't seen anything like this before. It has attributes which suit exactly the sort of vision that we have for regional Australia. Someone had to point out to him then that he had voted against it. He had voted against it! That is the problem with the ALP. Whether it has been our ensuring that, through restoring the nation's books, we were able to achieve that most important objective for rural and regional Australia, getting inflation and interest rates under control; whether it has been in programs like the Natural Heritage Trust, Networking the Nation, the social bonus, the $600 million plus for regional health, which the Minister for Health and Aged Care talked about, to address the problem that is a direct result of the failures of those opposite to plan for health in rural and regional Australia in the past; whether it has been initiatives like the Regional Solutions Fund, the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, or a whole range of very worthwhile initiatives - the reality is that Labor's performance pales into total insignificance when it comes to any contrast with the things that the coalition government has delivered for rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The House will be interested to note that this year the export of vehicles and automotive parts out of Australia has increased by 36 per cent, to $3.8 billion. The Australian automotive industry is one of the great success stories of Australian exporting industries. Motor vehicle exports grew by 44 per cent, to $1.9 billion, last year, into some interesting markets and out of areas of much needed employment in South Australia and Adelaide and out of Melbourne in Victoria, where the member who asks the question comes from. It is interesting to note that in the last 12 months those motor vehicle exports grew to $1.9 billion compared to the last year of a Labor government in this country when there was only $550 million worth of motor vehicle exports. Under the coalition, exports of motor vehicles have risen by an average of 29 per cent a year, to 85,000 units last year. During Labor's last year of office in 1995-96, there was only one passenger vehicle exported to the Middle East - one single, solitary vehicle. Last financial year, under our government, 55,910 motor cars were exported from Australia to the Middle East - $1 billion worth. We went from one car to $1 billion worth, and it had nothing to do with the Labor Party. The Labor Party get out there and say, `Oh, it was all the Button plan.' It just so happened that you were expecting the people of Australia to believe that the automotive industry -  - in Australia got the Button plan, slipped it into the drawer for 10 years and then pulled it out when they got some decent economic management and got into the export market. That is a lot of rubbish. The Australian exporters will not believe the Australian Labor Party when they put that on. Just to finish off the point, I was in South Africa recently with a trade delegation. We are about to start exporting Holden motor cars from Adelaide into South Africa. We will come back here in 12 months time and see those figures increased again. And it has nothing to do with Labor Party policy; it has everything to do with the economic management of our government and the industry policy of our government. The member for Fraser can laugh all he likes, but it has nothing to do with your policies in the 1980s. It is the economic management we have generated in this country. As the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, the figures post June of this year in terms of domestic demand and consumption have been increasing. The Labor Party warned that the sky was going to fall, that there would be no market for motor cars in Australia. In July the figures were up by 26 per cent, in August by 21 per cent and in October by 10 per cent. On top of that, there were fantastic export figures that are generating more and more jobs for Australians today and into the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. As usual, they try and put words in your mouth. We have canvassed these issues quite extensively in this place; we really have. As I indicated earlier, the problem is that the ALP never really had anything in the way of a customer service guarantee, for example, when they were in power. They had nothing at all when they were in power. We put that in place. They did nothing to quantify - to go out and establish - what services were available and where they were inadequate, as we have done with the Besley inquiry, as a result of which we are now moving to plug those gaps. When they were in government, what did we have? The reality is that we had no say in it; there were no sanctions for poor delivery by Telstra; there was no commitment by them to upgrading. As I say, it was not so very long ago that a lot of rural and regional Australia, when those opposite were in power, were still on the ALP's party lines where, after three minutes, you would get a polite voice interjecting and asking you whether you wanted to extend. The truth is that people do not want to live in a stagecoach age any more. - The fact is that the key to job opportunity expansion insofar as it involves telecommunications in rural and regional Australia is the quality of the services and the capacity to tap into world-class technology as it becomes available as soon as possible, and I think that is pretty widely acknowledged, even though the ALP does not want to acknowledge it.In relation to the 14 jobs with NDC in the Rockhampton region, I think there are a couple of points that were made yesterday that need to be reiterated. The first is that all but 12 of the 400 positions, including all positions in regional Australia, will be voluntary redundancies. The second - this is a very important point that has to be made that reinforces what I am saying and undercuts the ALP's outdated approach to this -  is that employment growth in the communications sector has increased by over 12 per cent in the two years to December 1999. This is a very rapidly growing sector of the economy, and not only is jobs growth rapid in that sector but also it is quite evident that investment and job opportunities will depend largely on that investment in other industries as the economy changes and as the changes in the economy reach into rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - Conscious of time, I am very pleased that last night the Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 went through, which is going to give a vast amount of new assistance, particularly to families in regional and rural Australia. The major area is for those young Australians between the ages of 16 and 25 and their families with the changes to the assets test where the percentage of the youth allowance to be disregarded will be 75 per cent. Now many more family farming families, and particularly families with businesses, will be able to access youth allowance. Youth allowance has been a terrific initiative by the coalition government - 7,200 young Australians that were not eligible before will now get access to youth allowance. This is in addition to the $254 million extra that we put in a few years ago for youth allowance where 65,000 more students are eligible for youth allowance and are getting rent assistance that they never got from the Australian Labor Party. The other important element of the bill passed last night was in child care. In a more flexible arrangement, 7,700 more children will now get access to child care who could not get access before with in-home care, which is particularly important to families in regional areas which never had access to child care. The terrific thing is that 577,000 children now have access to child care - an increase of about 100,000 since the Australian Labor Party were in government. The Isolated Children's Parents Association are here today, and we welcome you in Canberra as you do your lobbying. We certainly appreciate the comments that you have made about the Howard-Anderson government for its commitment to the provision of child-care services for families in rural and remote areas. The Australian Labor Party never did anything for rural and remote Australia. We know that. When you look at youth allowance, 265,000 were eligible back then and there are over 300,000 now eligible under our government. The question has to be asked: are you going to be rolling back that provision? We know the only resonance that you have with regional and rural Australia is because of the member for Lilley, who likes cooking - cooking the books with his AWU mates in getting more people on the electoral roll.</DOC>

 - The world cotton committee is meeting in Cairns at the present time and the Australian government has been instrumental, actually under the initiative of the Deputy Prime Minister when he was agriculture minister, in attracting this important event to Australia. There are 400 delegates present. The cotton industry is one of Australia's most successful rural industries, as the honourable member has just mentioned, and they were able to announce at this conference that Australia's projected crop next year will be 3.38 million bales, the fourth year in a row that our production will exceed three million bales. We are the third largest exporter in the world, with 90 per cent of our cotton going overseas. This industry is indeed a buoyant one that is doing exceptionally well.Mr Prime Minister, you will be interested to know that they are especially supportive of your initiative announced on Friday in relation to salinity and water quality. It is an industry that is very dependent upon reliable supplies of irrigation water and they are very keen that the states and the communities work together to achieve those objectives. On the other hand, they are very critical of the New South Wales and Queensland Labor governments, which have failed to honour their commitments to the COAG agreement signed in 1994 to give water licence holders secure long-term and compensatible property rights. It is unfortunate that those state governments do not recognise how important the cotton industry is to their economy and to rural and regional Australia. This is one of the success stories and it is important that governments and communities work together to build on their achievements to guarantee their export income for the future.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I do not examine the brochures put out by every school around Australia. I do, however, examine the outcomes of the application of the new policy introduced by the government. That examination demonstrates to me the essential fairness of the new SES system. That new system means that schools like the King's School will end up receiving vastly less resources from the government than the more needy independent schools. Instead of playing this rather old-fashioned, very foolish class game that the Australian Labor Party is playing which we have seen introduced into this debate - I might say promoted this morning by an article in the Sydney Morning Herald that purports to list the schools attended by different members of the frontbench of both the government and the opposition - I would have thought that what is relevant is not what school you went to or what school your children went to but the quality of your policy. I decry absolutely the way in which the Labor Party and others have sought to smear people by some reference to the school they went to. I simply say to you, Mr Speaker, that the Labor Party is trying to introduce the politics of class and envy into this debate.  The real evidence of that is to actually analyse what the leaders of the Catholic system and the leaders of all the other independent school groupings in Australia have said. Without exception, the leaders of the Catholic education system, the leaders of the independent schools, the leaders of the Christian schools and the leaders of all the other non-government schools have applauded the government system on the grounds of fairness. Even more importantly, and it must be ringing in the ears of the Leader of the Opposition, every single Labor Premier who came to the meeting last Friday endorsed without qualification the government's new funding formula - every last one of them. During the discussion they were given the opportunity, and they all said, `We don't want a cent taken away from independent schools.' That is what Peter Beattie said. He did not wave brochures around at me. He did not play the politics of class. He did not play the class card, as the Leader of the Opposition is doing. It is a tawdry attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to play the class card - a very tawdry attempt. The reality is that the new funding formula will result in the neediest non-government schools getting the most help and the less needy getting the least help. That is eminently fair on any measure.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and recognise the stalwart support she gives to her constituents as the government addresses this difficult issue. This government has said all along that Australia is prepared to make a fair contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and that has been a consistent position of this government. But what we have also said is that we are not prepared to carry an unfair share of the burden. When the government, represented by Senator Hill and officials from a number of departments, goes to the sixth Conference of the Parties in The Hague, we will attempt to achieve an outcome which minimises the cost to Australia of implementing the Kyoto protocol. The two most important issues for us in that respect will be securing workable and efficient rules for sinks and for international emissions trading and the other flexibility mechanisms in the protocol. Successful outcomes on these issues would not only reduce the impact on our economy but also increase the likelihood of countries with greenhouse targets under the Kyoto protocol actually being able to meet those targets. Such a sensible outcome in The Hague will maximise the likelihood of achieving the protocol's environment objectives.This country has already taken a lead with domestic greenhouse programs totalling nearly  $1 billion over five years. But climate change is a global issue and it requires global solutions, especially with emissions from developing countries set to exceed those of developed countries within the next decade. Commitments by large developing country emitters will be necessary, otherwise jobs in energy intensive industries could move from Australia to developing countries without any environmental benefit whatsoever. So the government wants to avoid a situation where Australian exporters are burdened by strict greenhouse constraints and yet some of our competitors have no constraints at all. This is an important conference, the meeting in The Hague, but I think the Australian public can rest assured that this is a government which not only takes its environmental responsibilities seriously but is prepared to stand up very strongly for Australia's interests in The Hague. </DOC>

 - I think it is -  - It think it is better to have a funding policy for independent schools which results in the more needy independent schools getting a lot more, and that is exactly our policy. -  - I also think it is better -  - I think it is better education policy to have state governments matching rates of federal government increased support for government schools instead of lagging behind them. For example, it is my advice that in the current financial year federal government funding for government schools to the state of Queensland has risen by 4.4 per cent, whereas state government funding for government schools in Queensland has risen by only 0.8 per cent. It is my advice that federal government funding for government schools in New South Wales has risen by four per cent, yet state government funding for government schools in New South Wales has risen by only 1.9 per cent. -  - So, instead of -  - So, instead of the Labor Party desperately carrying on in this class driven fashion -  -  - It is a class driven fashion. They do not have any argument based on policy; they have an argument based on class and envy, and the Australian people have rejected that in the past and they will reject it again.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Forde for her question. Over the last few weeks we have revealed some of the price watch information provided by the Australian Labor Party after the impact of the GST has been taken in on prices, and on reflection perhaps I have been a little bit tough on the member for Lilley.Government members - Really! - I have. I know it is hard for some on this side to believe - and some people in the Labor Party do not believe me either. I have been a little bit harsh, because I thought that the member for Lilley was the only person running a price watch program on the Labor Party side of the House. That was before some information was presented to me in relation to another Queensland member of the Labor Party. I happened to come across a copy of the Southern Star, which has the words:I have decided to establish a local GST pricewatch here on the south side. It is going to take a while to set it up properly. On a monthly basis we will take a standard basket of goods and analyse price changes,' ... we will on volunteers, and so on.The member for Griffith runs a price watch survey for February of this year, covering Coles, Franklins and Woolworths. He talks about the GST price watch in February, talks about `70 days until the GST' in April and then we come to The Rudd Report in July. I was running a bit short of information then and I decided to go to his web site, which in fact was updated on 28 July. I went to his web site today, looked for the price watch information and I came across a price survey from February - and then it stops. So what happened to the monthly analysis for April, May, June, July, August and September? What is it with the Labor Party members from Queensland and numbers? -  - What is it? Without taking the focus off the member for Lilley, I was asked about alternative policies. I went to the member for Lilley's webpage - and he has now updated it with the August figures - and it took me a little while but I found some immortal words where the member for Lilley says in a hushed tone in the House - because they have got his words in the House:And that is why, we have an emphatic, an absolutely emphatic commitment to roll back the GST.You can press play and hear it again! If the Labor Party's own price survey says that consumers are better off with the GST, then why does the Labor Party want to roll it back? We are watching individual members of the Labor Party, we are watching the commitments they made before 1 July, and we will continue to look for their words in the printed form. When it comes to roll-back, I think Australian consumers deserve to know why the Labor Party want to make a basket at the supermarket more expensive if they ever get elected into government.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the particular fundraising activities of the King's School or, indeed, of other schools, other than a residual understanding of the fundraising activities of particular schools with which my children were associated several years ago. But I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is my understanding that tax deductibility of the type he referred to was, of course, maintained during the whole time the Labor Party was in government. Therefore, I assume he is not attacking that principle.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The House has been rather well informed by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation of the exploits of the member for Lilley in relation to his price watch activities and the exploits of the member for Griffith. We also recall the exploits of the member for Melbourne, who doctored a price survey which he put out by not releasing the full details. - Rather than go over that episode, I will table an article from the Herald Sun of 20 July 2000 headed `Labor exposed in GST cover-up: half truths leave Beazley stranded'. I have also just come across a very interesting new survey on the new tax system, which is from the Dickson report, headed, `Results of electorate wide issues survey: responses to small business questionnaire on the GST'. The Dickson report says that, of the small business questionnaire on the GST, 53 per cent said it had a negative impact, 21 per cent said it had a positive impact, 22 per cent said it had no impact and 13 per cent made no comment. I was rather intrigued by this return because, if 53 per cent said negative and 21 per cent said positive, which would make 74 per cent, 22 per cent said no impact, which would make 96 per cent, and 13 per cent had no comment, that makes it one of the most outstanding survey results I have ever come across. The member for Dickson sends out 100 questionnaires and gets 109 replies. It is like voting for the Queensland ALP. The turnout is 109 per cent of those on the electoral roll!I would have thought that this is a rather obvious point because, with a pie chart, if it were more than 53 per cent, it would have to be more than half the pie; yet the 53 per cent who had a negative impact is less than half the pie, quite clearly. I am not quite sure what sort of pie chart this is. I thought it could be a porky pie chart or, if one were eating it, a humble pie chart! Whichever way it goes, it falls into a grand Queensland Labor Party tradition - the member for Dickson and the member for Griffith gilding the lily, with old Swanie there with his surveys. I table the survey for the information of the House.</DOC>

 - I note that the honourable member asked me whether I would comment as an old boy of the school. I am an old boy of the school. I regret to have to inform the class warriors opposite that I cannot apologise for that. I can acknowledge that I was fortunate to attend it. I will make a few points that I think might be relevant in this debate. Yes, there are some very wealthy parents and wealthy people involved in that school community. There are also many who are not so wealthy - there really are. There are also, I think it is fair to say, many parents in parts of the country who are not in a position to find it easy to educate their children: (a) they find it hard to raise the finances and (b) they struggle against the real problems that isolation can bring when you are trying to educate your children. Indeed, in my own case - I do not know what members of the House will make of it - I actually did not go into a classroom until I was nine years old, because of isolation. A large part of the reason I went to that school is that there were no other ready options - there really were not. The second part of your question goes to what we have done for schools in rural and regional areas. I will make several points about that, but the first and foremost is that I have a very large number of small independent schools in my electorate. To be even-handed about this, I want to say that I am enormously impressed -  -  - You are obviously not really interested in any sincere answer to this - obviously not. I am enormously impressed by the quality of work that some of those schools do. There is a small independent school at Wellington in my electorate, the staff of which have consciously gone out to draw children from very disadvantaged backgrounds, including the local indigenous community. Do you know what their response is? When I went to visit them recently, they told me that what we have put in place is invaluable for their school, for their community and for the future of the children in the area. Far from advocating change, they thanked me very fulsomely for what the government have done. They believe that we have done a lot to help create a better environment of opportunity for some very severely disadvantaged children in their region. We are about choice. We are about helping parents who often have to make very agonising sacrifices, let alone the decision in the first place, before they make those sacrifices, about how they are going to educate their children. I really believe that what we have done is fair and reasonable. I believe it passes what might be called the pub test. I certainly find that in my electorate.I do not deny at all that the school that I went to is well off. I do not deny that. I do not deny that I was privileged and fortunate to go to it. I find it more than passing strange that the sort of sense I get around this place is that somehow, because I was fortunate enough to go there, I ought to be debarred from trying to make a contribution to public life in this country. You are just pathetic, you really are. I would also point out that I believe that choice is very important. I believe that a lot of Australian children will get better opportunities in life because of what we have done to enhance choice. - Mr Speaker, there was an assumption in the question that I have received that document. I have not sighted that document. I may or may not have received it, but you ought not to assume it, and I see no reason why it should be tabled. Leave not granted. </DOC>

I am aware of a questionnaire being distributed by the member for Newcastle, along with an advertisement for a Labor Party fundraising dinner. Surveys of the type being distributed by the member for Newcastle are as easy to rort as membership of the Queensland Labor Party, and the results of any such surveys are as dodgy as the Queensland electoral rolls when people like the member for Lilley are referred to as the `master' of the rolls. - Mr Speaker, I was simply referring to the fact that the member for Lilley was the Queensland state Labor Party secretary at a time when Labor Party members were rorting the electoral roll. - The fact is, for the benefit of the member for Newcastle - </DOC>

 - The government's policy for funding non-government schools is part of a massive investment in schooling which this government is currently making, and it produces increases in funding for non-government schools and government schools. In fact, the former school of the member for Dobell, De La Salle, has undoubtedly benefited enormously from the fair funding and the recognition of needs of the Catholic systemic and non-systemic schools under the government's funding arrangements. I do not think anybody - and I am sure the member for Dobell was not implying this - would think that the government's funding arrangements are related to the particular schools to which members of the government or the opposition went. One of the great features of this system is that it puts, for the first time, a clear downward pressure on school fees. It makes schools a great deal more accessible, regardless of the efforts that parents make. Let us make it quite clear that when the opposition talks about capital funding for these schools, this is all money raised by parents. The government is not making capital contributions to schools such as King's School. All these funds are being raised by parents.The government's funding arrangements for non-government schools are exceedingly fair. They are based on an objective measure of the needs of parents, not on the prejudices of the Labor Party and not on the views of the Australian Education Union - for whom you are making a very considerable down payment in this rhetoric of envy that you are producing at the present time. Schools serving high income communities will be paid 13.7 per cent of the amount that would be paid if the child went to the local government school. A school like King's, for example, will be paid at 31 per cent of the rate that would be paid if the child were sent to the local government school. So Parramatta High down the road gets $8,000 from the taxpayer and capital funding from the taxpayer. I am not saying that this is true for Parramatta High in recent times, but many government schools are getting capital grants from the taxpayer of well over $1 million, because this money is directed according to need. A school like King's, therefore, gets 31 per cent of the cost of sending a child to a government school, and that equates to $2,500 per student in 2004, compared to total government funding of $8,000 for the government school down the road.The utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party in this matter is shown by the fact that they object to a school which principally services regional and rural Australia - where there has been a big income loss - getting 31 per cent of the cost of sending a child to a government school, whereas under their funding system they were prepared to fund a school such as Loreto Kirribilli, serving high income communities on the North Shore of Sydney, at 40 per cent. They claim that 30 per cent is too much for a school serving rural and regional Australia, but 40 per cent is not too much for a school serving well-to-do communities on the North Shore of Sydney. That is the Labor Party's utter hypocrisy on this matter. If one wants to understand this contemptible line of questioning coming from the opposition, one only has to reflect on the fact that they desperately need the foot soldiers of the Australian Education Union out there at the polling booths at the next election. This rhetoric is just a way of making a down payment on the next election campaign. But in the end, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, he will pass this legislation in the Senate. He is so opposed to it that he will pass this legislation in the Senate. He hates it so much that it will become Labor Party policy when the Labor Party passes this bill in the Senate. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. It is extremely disappointing to see that the Labor Party is continuing to play its game of political chance with the state based native title regimes after allowing a Labor state to succeed in introducing its own native title regime - albeit only a half-baked scheme - in Queensland. Labor is going to knock out a scheme in a state with a coalition government.   -  - The member for Fraser, whom you have just been indirectly addressing, Mr Speaker, signalled Labor's intention to move a disallowance motion in the Senate only hours after the determination in relation to Western Australia had been tabled. With such a quick reaction there must obviously have been a very detailed consideration of the extensive explanatory statement that was tabled at the same time. The resource sector is a key industry for both WA and for Australia. It earns vital export dollars and it provides jobs for indigenous and non-indigenous people alike. The Premier of Western Australia is wont to say that Western Australia has 10 per cent of the population and produces 25 per cent of the export earnings.  - The Prime Minister says that he has heard him say that. The consequence of that is that uncertainty over native title has a significant impact on exploration and mining investment, with consequences for all Australians. According to the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, exploration expenditure in WA has fallen by 43 per cent from its peak in 1997; gold exploration has fallen by 60 per cent over the same period; annual exploration expenditure is $268 million a year less than in 1997; and outstanding tenement applications have grown from nil at the end of 1995 to 11,000 in 1998 due to native title complications. All federal members and senators have today been sent a letter seeking support for the WA regime. The letter was signed by six presidents of six organisations: the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA, the WA Farmers Federation and the Forest Industries Federation - all involved with employers and providing employment to indigenous and non-indigenous people alike. In that letter, the presidents say: We contend that the scope for successful native title agreements between WA stakeholders could be greatly enhanced by allowing them more direct local control and involvement through the mechanisms of the proposed state legislation. Conversely, Senate full or partial rejection would seriously threaten future progress. Despite all this, it appears that Federal Labor is trying to compensate for its hypocritical deal on Queensland native title by threatening to throw out the WA regime. The member for Fraser is accusing the Court government of playing politics and being deliberately provocative with native title. The Court government has always made its intentions quite clear. WA wants its own solutions to native title - procedural requirements relating to certain mining tenements and compulsory acquisitions on pastoral lease and reserved land that have been specifically designed to suit WA. But it remains to be seen how Labor will explain its duplicity in the course of the coming state campaign to the people of WA, especially those in the places in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate where mining is the lifeblood of the community, indigenous and non-indigenous alike.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. The reports of the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia that were tabled in the parliament last week are very instructive indeed. The report of the Federal Court records that Migration Act cases are a growing part of its workload. Since 1995-96 the number of migration cases has increased by more than 150 per cent, from 331 cases in 1995-96 to 829 cases in 1999-2000. In the court's appellate workload, migration cases in 1995-96 were eight per cent. Last year that had jumped to 36 per cent. That effectively means that people who have had a decision at first instance are appealing more frequently to the Full Federal Court. The High Court's report for 1999-2000 records that the increase in the migration workload has been very significant. In 1998-99 there were 25 single justice hearings involving what they call order nisi applications. By last year that had soared to 173, and 88 per cent of them involved migration matters. This trend is likely to continue. The High Court expressed concern in its annual report saying: These applications consume a large amount of judicial time, particularly in requiring more than one hearing. It is not just the courts that have been expressing this concern. I found a very interesting quote in these terms relating to the plight of the individuals who are seeking remedies. The quote is as follows:The real delay in the refugee determination process occurs when failed applicants decide to pursue litigation. It is the litigation process before the courts that can take years, not the determination process.That was a quote from a minister for immigration, but not in 2000; in 1995. It came from Senator Nick Bolkus.It is obvious that in 1995 the Labor Party recognised that there was a problem, but it does not seem to recognise that any longer. Perhaps it might help the opposition if it were to know that those people who resort to litigation can obtain work rights or can, in fact, remain in Australia lawfully while they work illegally. At present there are 682 active litigation cases involving refugee and migration matters. Those litigants and their families could have work rights or could be working illegally. There have been 1,163 cases resolved during the past year - and, again, they could have been working lawfully or unlawfully. There are 5,000 people who are members of seven class actions currently before the courts. Many of those litigants and their families can get work rights or may be working unlawfully in Australia.The Labor Party has professed to be concerned about people who come to Australia and breach visa conditions and work unlawfully. It professes to be concerned about people working illegally in the Australian community. But, if you take these figures and look at the almost 7,000 people who could be working -  - and if you add to this the dependants who could be working, you would be looking at something like 13,000 cases. -  - Let me just elaborate a little. You know that we locate a very large number of people. When Labor was in office, we saw the location rates fall to something of the order of five or six thousand, and they have risen under this government to of the order of 13,000 a year. When people are located and are being removed from Australia, in well in excess of 50 per cent of the cases they admit to having been working unlawfully in Australia. The point I want to make on this is that there is a way of dealing with this important issue. - If you have any concern about people working unlawfully and taking jobs from Australians, there is a way you can deal with it, and you can take the load off the courts by instituting a privative clause. In other words, you do not have to be - as you are today - part of the problem; you can be part of the solution.</DOC>

 - In 1997 the government announced a program which involved the market testing of information technology on a whole of government basis for the purposes of determining whether it was appropriate to outsource or not. In fact, that was a program that was first set in place by the then minister for finance, the now Leader of the Opposition. In the process of examining that in 1997, the government took into account some extensive work that had been started under Labor and it was finetuned by the government. It was a proposition at that point in time, which I still stand by, that there was capacity to make savings of about $1 billion over the seven-year life of the contract on a whole of government basis. The Auditor-General recently released a report in respect of the first three of some 10 contracts - in percentage terms, not yet 30 per cent of the outsourcing program. There has been a view expressed by the Auditor-General, a view which is based upon accountancy methodology, that the projected savings that were announced by the government in respect of those three contracts were not in fact as large as they might have been. In fact, those arguments become fairly academic; they are based upon net present value and things like competitive neutrality and also on whether or not there is a return of the assets and whether it is an operating lease or a financing lease. The government stands by its methodology there, because that is backed by the Department of Finance and Administration, and it is the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing that put this information together. The department of finance stands by the methodology, Treasury stands by the methodology, the Australian Bureau of Statistics stands by the methodology and several of the accountancy firms stand by the methodology. So we are now down to a point as to whether the savings are less than they were estimated or projected to be in 1997 when the program commenced. What I can say - and nobody argues - is that there are significant savings to the Australian taxpayers. It is nice to be able to stand up here and say that a program of the government is making savings. For some 13 years, and particularly the last six years, under Labor, this House was all about the cost to the taxpayers of deficit budgets. We know just how accountable the then Labor government were when it came to managing the financial provisions of the Commonwealth. They certainly brought about significant losses - some $70 billion of general government debt in the last five budgets alone. I think that covers the various questions that have been asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. There is a review. It is the mid-term or the midway in respect of this particular program. We have now signed on five contracts out of 10, and it is appropriate at any time for there to be a continuous improvement program in place. It was foreshadowed back in 1998 that there would be an evaluation of both the costs and the benefits. There are savings; they are significant. I stand by the methodology the government used because it is backed by independent people. I certainly stand by what this program has done for regional development and for the creation of jobs and what it has done for the information technology industry, which is a growth area of this economy. It has brought about a significant improvement in the amount of work that is occurring here. This is a growth area of the economy. Australia has significant skills, and this program is assisting the development of those skills, which is very important for the future of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I am aware of a paid political advertisement that appeared in a newspaper today and was signed by 120 supporters of the Labor Party. Those legitimately concerned with funding for non-government schools would be aware of another, perhaps more credible, open letter that has been circulated to senators. This letter, which was coordinated by the National Council of Independent Schools Associations, was circulated again yesterday. The press release with which the National Council of Independent Schools Associations circulated this letter said that Australia's leaders should try to unite and lead the community on the issue of school funding, not divide it with an ill-informed attack on non-government schools. The executive director of the NCISA, Mr Thomson, said the open letter signed by 120 Australians failed the community and missed the point. He questioned the purpose and principle of those who would seek to divide the community by attacking non-government schools.  I urge people to instead consider another open letter to the Senate signed by the leaders of Anglican schools, Christian schools, Lutheran schools, Rudolf Steiner schools, Seventh Day Adventist schools, Uniting Church schools, the heads of independent schools and the NCISA. It calls on the Senate to pass the SES legislation, which has the considered support of the independent school sector.When it comes to the fair funding of non-government schools, who should we listen to? Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, or the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Sydney on behalf of the Anglican Church of Australia? Denis Fitzgerald or the Uniting Church of Australia? Joan Kirner or the Association of Christian Schools? The ACTU and the AEU or the National Catholic Education Commission and the Australian Catholic bishops?The government's fairer funding reforms enjoy the support of the entire non-government sector, of all the major Australian religious groupings, of every major ethnic grouping in Australia and even of all the state premiers. Those running a campaign of opposition to these reforms show their sheer arrogance and what they are prepared to resort to to buy the votes of the Australian Education Union. The non-government schools have been working for years to find an objective, transparent, non-politicised funding system. All the Labor Party has to offer them is a return to prejudice and 19th century stereotypes. It is time for the Labor Party to come into the 21st century. As we know, the Labor Party hates this bill so much it is going to pass it. Cut the posturing and tell your senators to get on with passing the legislation. -  </DOC>

 - I anticipated that there may be a question in respect of the midyear economic and fiscal outlook and what it might show, because the Treasurer has indicated that that will be released very soon. I would simply indicate to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he should wait until the midyear economic and fiscal outlook is there. Let me also say that as a general rule I do not comment on what the government might expect from any particular asset sale. I do not intend to comment on what we might receive. There are obvious reasons why I would not, and I am sure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that. I think I can just leave it at that. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I note his interest in transport matters, although it usually extends to rail to a greater extent than it does to aviation. I am, nonetheless, delighted to be able to inform the House that the government's policy of encouraging new airline entrants and their activities in the domestic market in this country is really now paying off in a big way. Australian travellers, of course, as we have all noted through the media - and many have noted through booking air fares themselves - are benefiting from a range of excellent discount fares being offered by all airlines in response to very strong marketing by Impulse and Virgin Blue. Many people who have not previously flown, or who have not flown regularly, are now taking to the skies in a big way. This has resulted in a very significant increase in the size of the domestic aviation market. August statistics reveal that the growth of the total aviation market in Australia over the last 12 months has been of the order of 150,000 passengers. It has been even higher, relatively speaking, on the most competitive routes: Sydney-Melbourne is up by 78,000 passengers and Brisbane-Sydney is up by 37,000 passengers. Both Impulse Airlines and Virgin Blue are now recording very healthy load factors. They both seem to be in a very good position to participate in the long term in this very competitive industry. Not only will there be new opportunities on the busy east coast sector but also, and more importantly, there will be more choices for Australian consumers elsewhere. There is plenty of scope for more competition on many more routes. I know those from Western Australia, for example, are watching with great interest, but so are people in rural and regional areas. I believe that there is very good reason for the airlines to accept, to recognise and to act on the importance of maintaining and increasing their services in regional parts of the country. We have seen the ushering in of a new period of affordable airline travel. We are seeing real benefits for the Australian tourism industry, in particular. We are also seeing more jobs in the airline industry as the new entrants establish themselves well and truly on the local scene.All of these government policies - from the very important economic fundamentals that have made investment easier and more attractive through to the leasing of the major airlines, the improvement in terminal facilities and the diversification of operations that that has encouraged and, of course, particularly in relation to Sydney airport, the reservation of slots for new entrants under the slots management scheme - have undergirded and, indeed, encouraged this major expansion in our aviation industry to the benefit of travellers, to the benefit of tourism and to the benefit of jobs growth.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Manager of Opposition Business let me say that, in all the time that I have known him, the member for Sturt has not been one who has been inclined to take instructions from anybody - let alone from me. I have always found him to be a rather independent spirit. I have frequent discussions with all of my colleagues. As the member for Sturt would acknowledge, I am an inclusive leader. All I can say is that the discussions I have with my colleagues are eminently proper. I also remind the Manager of Opposition Business that, in relation to the member for Eden-Monaro, I actually heard the member for Eden-Monaro on the airwaves, when I was out on an early morning constitutional, explaining why he was no longer going to be chairman of that particular committee. I thought it had to do with a commitment to his electors, which of course is characteristic of both the member for Sturt and the member for Eden-Monaro.As to the question of allegations, my view in relation to allegations made against people is that if they ought to be referred to the police they will be. Insofar as they are brought to my attention, it has always been my practice, where it is appropriate, that they be referred. I would remind the Manager of Opposition Business that there were some extremely woolly allegations made - they would hardly merit the description of  `serious allegations' - on the 7.30 Report by Brian Courtice, a former member of this House. They were referred by me to the Minister for Justice and Customs the following day. Unlike the Evans-Beazley protocol, we act quickly. </DOC>

 - I commend the member on his interest in tourism. I know that as a former New South Wales minister for tourism working under the previous Hawke-Keating governments he had extreme trouble getting a unified approach to growing the domestic tourism pie. It has been the leadership of this government that has put up $8 million to join a $16 million domestic tourism initiative that is going to grow the domestic pie. This has culminated in the launch this week of an advertising campaign right across Australia using Ernie Dingo telling Australians to take their holidays in Australia. With this program we particularly hope to grow the tourism pie. Rather than leaving our state tourism ministers to fight amongst themselves over pieces of the pie, we are actually going to grow domestic tourism in Australia. It really comes from the leadership that this government has shown in developing this program. We have had Labor for the last 12 months running a big scare campaign on the effects of the GST. We have seen this in the electorates of Lilley, Griffith and Dickson, with predictions of the terrible impacts that were going to come that have not shown through. We have already seen international tourism growing at nearly double-digit figures. With this program working in a unified way across Australia, we certainly expect to see the same with domestic tourism.</DOC>

 - The budgets which have been delivered now for five years by the coalition government have adopted the same methodology when it came to asset sales that was applied by the previous Labor government for some 13 years. As I indicated in answer to a question earlier in question time, it is not the practice of governments to speculate on what any particular sale might bring. Clearly, one does not speculate for reasons of not giving any indication to the market as to what the government considers the value might be or might not be. The same methodology is adopted in preparing the budget on asset sales as was used by the former Labor government, and the government will continue to apply that methodology. If the honourable member wants to find out what was in the 2000 budget, I suggest that, despite the fact that it is now six months since the documents were released, he might go back and have a look at what was in those papers and examine them a little more thoroughly. But the methodology is the same and I do not intend to speculate or change that. It will not be the practice of this government to change what was previously done by the Labor government when it came to questions of asset sales.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He obviously takes a great deal of interest, representing an electorate that does a considerable amount of export business for Australia. It is interesting to note that, three years after the start of the Asian economic crisis, Australia's merchandise exports to East Asia are at a record high of $55.8 billion. Exports to East Asia are now 66 per cent above the lowest level during the crisis, which was in February 1999. During that time of the Asian economic crisis, Australia diversified into new markets, showing that the government's Asia-plus trade strategy was exactly what was required during that period. We have maintained those new markets as well as regaining our market share within East Asia. Some of the spectacular export performers into that East Asian market are interesting to note. For example, oilseed exports to China have increased from $64,000 worth in 1996 to $406 million worth in 1999-2000. I spoke about our automotive exports yesterday. In 1996 we exported $31 million worth of car parts to Korea. In 1999-2000 that is $103 million worth - certainly a significant increase over that period of time.  Later this week the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will be going to the APEC ministerial meeting in Brunei, and next week the Prime Minister will attend the leaders' meeting in Brunei. Australia has worked within the regional forum of APEC to underpin the success in Asia and East Asia as we have fought back since the depths of the economic crisis. Australia has led the way in strengthening the reporting of progress towards the APEC goals of free and open trade and investment with policies such as the electronic individual action plan, which we presented and led the way with in the ministerial meeting in Darwin earlier this year. Also at that ministerial meeting in Darwin, which I chaired, we agreed to the launch of the BizAPEC.com web site, which gives exporters an opportunity to go through a single portal and access new markets, getting market intelligence and information off the web. Since we launched that BizAPEC site in June of this year, the Australian business community has responded enthusiastically to the site, with the latest statistics showing an average of over 12,000 hits per month from Australian businesses accessing market information through the BizAPEC site. Of course, that will get further endorsement at the Brunei meeting next week. We all know, and Australian exporters know, that the only threat to the current success of Australia's exporters is a possibility of the election of a Labor government in the future and rolling back a lot of the economic reforms we have introduced in this country that have provided a very sound economic base domestically within Australia from which they can launch themselves into the international marketplace. As the statistics continue to show, they have been doing that during our period of government since 1996.</DOC>

 - As I recall, I quoted Mr Blair as agreeing with our Prime Minister and saying that Mr Blair had endorsed statements that were made that day by Prime Minister Howard on the importance of protecting surpluses and low interest rates. As it turns out, I am very familiar with the statement that was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said he is not going to increase duty on fuel again until April 2002. That was the statement that he made - again until April 2002. I can understand why the Chancellor of the Exchequer might take that view. The excise on petrol in Britain is 49p a litre, which is $A1.32 a litre. - He says it is frozen - frozen at $1.32 a litre. That would be a great thing. I think even the Labor Party would freeze it in Australia at $1.32 a litre. After it is frozen, until the Chancellor for the Exchequer puts it up in April 2002, at 49p or $1.32 a litre, a value added tax is then applied at 17½ per cent, making a total tax in Britain at 63.2p per litre - $A1.70. That is not the price in Britain. That is the tax in Britain - 49p and 17½ per cent value added tax.I noticed that the other thing the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated was that in Britain there would be a vehicle excise duty rate for lorries cut, but not a cut anything of the dimension of that introduced in Australia on 1 July of this year where for lorries - that is, trucks - the cut in excise was 24c a litre. I think the lorry drivers of Britain would be looking at Australia wistfully, wondering whether or not they could have the Australian treatment of a 24c per litre cut. All that goes to say that the Australian Labor Party opposed the 24c a litre cut. I have already referred in this House to the report of Senator Cook, who singled this out for criticism on the grounds, quoting the Australian Conservation Foundation, that we were the only country in the OECD reducing fuel taxes - that was the criticism - and then recom-mended that Labor vote against our policy. So here is the Labor Party, which was criticising us before 1 July for being the only OECD country to cut fuel taxes. We cut fuel taxes by 24c a litre. Our fuel tax compared to Europe is dramatically lower -   - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to hold up Britain as an example of his policy, then the people of Australia ought to know what that policy is. That policy is a tax of $1.70 per litre on petrol. I want to make that entirely clear - not a price of $1.70 per litre but in Australian dollars frozen until 2002 at $1.70 per litre. The Labor Party might think it is a good idea to freeze excise at $1.70 per litre. We think that would be massively high when we have an excise of 38c per litre.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can refer the House to a very interesting bulletin published by the US Federal Reserve in October 2000. The US Federal Reserve Bank reported that, as most people know, the US economy has surprised observers, growing briskly with low inflation. Its growth has averaged 4.2 per cent per annum, and this bulletin notes that the impressive performance of the US economy reflects an acceleration in recorded labour productivity. The performance of the US economy has indeed been quite impressive. Over the period 1996 to 1999 labour productivity grew in the US at 2.5 per cent and multifactor productivity at 1.47 per cent. These are exceptional growth rates. The US Federal Reserve noted that that was part of the American economic story. But what will interest members of the House and Australian readers is that the US Federal Reserve went on to find a country which had done better, and it remarked in its text the following:Only two of the foreign industrial economies in our sample, Australia and Switzerland, showed a rise in labor productivity growth over 1996-98 compared with the earlier periods. For Australia, the acceleration ... was particularly strong ... In contrast ... growth slowed in Canada, Japan, and the major European countries. In most smaller European countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands, labor productivity also decelerated ... The US performance, as found by the Federal Reserve, on productivity from 1996 on was, as I said, an increase in labour productivity of 2.5 per cent and multifactor productivity of 1.47. The US Federal Reserve found the comparable figures for Australia: 3.12 compared to US at 2.57, and 2.11 compared to the US at 1.47. In other words, the country which the Federal Reserve found had even exceeded the US in an increase in productivity, the key determinant of the new economy, was Australia, and the upturn in Australia occurred from 1996 onwards.That is a result no doubt of putting the budget back into balance, locking in a monetary policy target, changing the industrial relations system and heightening competition policy, and some of the benefits that we are now seeing for our people are reflected in greater jobs growth. The labour force figures this morning, released for the month of October, found that unemployment in Australia, at 6.3 per cent, is the lowest it has been in a decade. It is the lowest since Labor put the Australian economy into recession in 1990, the lowest since Labor peaked unemployment at 11.3 per cent under its then so-called employment minister, the now other interesting news from the labour Leader of the Opposition.The force figures this morning was that the female unemployment rate, at 5.9 per cent, is the lowest on record, and the member for Pearce no doubt had picked that up in the figures today - at 5.9 per cent, female unemployment the lowest on record. Since the government came to office, around 800,000 new jobs have been produced in the Australian economy. So strong growth, low inflation, strong jobs growth, falling unemployment and labour productivity which matches and beats the US economy. And I am sure all members, including members of the Labor Party, will recognise the good news for Australia in those productivity figures where Australia leads the world, the result of good policy, and with a new improved tax system with more reform the benefit will be more jobs for young Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question because it allows what is being conducted in Kenilworth to be put in the correct perspective. Firstly, there have been five sets of sanctions put in place against the proprietor of Kenilworth. During that time, the right to have any new residents admitted has been taken away. We have withdrawn or revoked 10 beds, with a further five subject to notification. There are teams of nurses who go in and monitor the health of the residents from both the department and the agency. Furthermore, there is the advocacy service in Victoria, a highly reputable organisation, which goes into that home on a regular basis. We are now down to eight residents remaining in that home at this stage.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. The existing school funding system that was put in place by the Labor Party, which goes under the title `ERI system', was reviewed by KPMG in 1996. KPMG concluded, in summary, that the ERI fails to meet most of the tests of an effective indicator of need. Yet this is the system that the Labor Party continues to want to introduce into the school funding legislation. The best way to illustrate the operation of this system and its complete failure to effectively identify need is to take a particular example. Let me give the example of a well-resourced school which has a gymnasium, multipurpose hall, a new musical auditorium, new science laboratories, computer rooms and dark room, five orchestras and ensemble groups and its sports include tennis, cricket, rowing, netball, touch football, hockey, swimming, diving, athletes, tae kwon do and snow skiing. The school has magnificent harbour views and serves one of the wealthiest communities in Australia. Yet, under Labor's funding system, this school received no less than 40 per cent per pupil of the cost of sending a child to a government school. This is not a category 1 school we are talking about; this is a category 8 school. This school is Loreto, Kirribilli, the school to which the former Labor minister Graham Richardson has put on the public record that he sent his children to. This is the kind of school which Labor members resort to. This is a school into which Labor, under its funding system, has pumped $27 million since 1985. I am not saying that this school received some $27 million from the Labor Party under this extraordinary classification because a Labor minister sent his children there. Some people might make that sort of accusation but I would not. This example illustrates the utter failure of Labor to put in place a needs based funding system for non-government schools. Let us contrast that with one of these infamous category 1 schools in Sydney that Labor is about to deny significant resources to. This is a category 1 school in south-west Sydney, located in Macquarie Fields, south of Liverpool. This category 1 school charges the exhorbitant fees of a little over $200 per student. Its facilities are lavish. This school is run out of a scout hall. It has less than 20 students. Yet, under Labor's ERI system, it is categorised as being in category 1. - This is one of Labor's elite schools which caters to the wealthy in our community and Labor is going to freeze its funding. This is the Bethel Learning Centre and its SES score is 93. It is resourced at a much lower level than the average parish school and serves a poorer community. Under Labor, this school will receive $595 per student. Under the government's fairer funding reforms, in 2004 this school will be entitled to $4,904 per student. Labor intends to deny this school, serving a low income community, some $4,300 per student. Yet it is satisfied with a funding system which gives a school serving one of the wealthiest communities in Australia 40 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. It is the kind of school that Labor leaders like to send their children to.The ERI system is totally unfair. It is totally discredited. No-one in the non-government sector supports it. All the major Australian churches have said that this system must be abandoned. Yet the lazy leader of the Labor Party, without a policy, wants to preserve this system in the school funding legislation. What utter hypocrisy we see on the part of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - In case the honourable member had not noticed, the Commonwealth does not run public hospitals. What the Commonwealth -  - You might direct that to the Minister for Aged Care if you can actually work that out. What the Commonwealth does is fund the states through health care agreements, and the states are expected to use that to run their hospitals. In terms of the funding for the hospital in your electorate that you mentioned, off the top of my head I can say that the funding has gone up 25 per cent in two years over and above what we funded under the last health and aged care agreement signed by Labor in 1993. So, in terms of the hospital, you should direct your question to Dean Brown.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Labor Party's policy of funding schools through the ERI is a policy of discouraging investment in education, because as soon as parents contribute to their school and build up its resources the Labor Party system operates to reduce support for that school. So what the Labor Party's policy actually does is create a system of high fee, elite schools. At the same time, it is utterly inequitable in its operations in relation to the classification of schools. These are arbitrary classifications in many cases, highly politicised classifications in others. We see just how flawed this system is when we look at the schools in category 1. Let us have a look at the impact of this funding system on a school in category 1 in South Australia. A letter has been circulated to all members of this parliament by the Principal of Prince Alfred College in South Australia. -  - The Labor Party should listen to this. This is not a bit of correspondence from Sharan Burrow or Denis Fitzgerald. This is a bit of correspondence from somebody who cares about the education of young people in Adelaide. I table the letter for the interest of members, and I will read from it:The reality is that despite -  -  - They do not want to hear the reality; they just want to stir up a little bit of hatred and envy. That is all that they have to offer; they have no policy. The letter reads:The reality is that despite our category 1 classification neither this school nor the overwhelming majority of our parents are wealthy. The label `wealthy' or `elite' seems to be applied simply stereotypically because we are a category 1 school. Yet this classification is based on financial data gathered in the early 1980s before my students, who are in year 12, were born. Being a category 1 school might suggest we had some wealthy parents in the early 1980s, but it bears no relationship whatsoever to our present economic circumstances.The principal goes on to say - and this is a consequence of the Labor Party's policy:The inflexibility of the ERI model prevents us from reducing fees as we would wish in order to make ourselves as open as possible to as wide a clientele as possible.The principal goes on to make the point that the ALP's amendments must inevitably have two highly undesirable effects:First, it will force category 1 schools to become economically elitist institutions by narrowing the population base which it can afford to attend. Second, it will challenge severely the financial viability of many category 1 schools, such as ours, as the funding gap between us and schools in category 2 and beyond widen sharply. What we are seeing here is the inevitable impact of the Labor Party's policy. It is a high fee policy, to push up the fees in schools that are well resourced so that only people like the Labor Party leaders - like Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and Simon Crean - can afford to send their children there. They want to oppose a policy which will allow more parents access to these schools. They do not care if these schools go to the wall and they do not care if these schools are put in a position where they cannot lower their fees, because what the Labor Party are about is making a down payment on the support of the Education Union. They want the support of that union in the election campaign. They are not interested in the realities of their policy. The Leader of the Opposition has been so lazy that when the Labor Party put forward amendments in the Senate they put forward amendments which everybody can see have no credibility. You have no credibility up in the gallery with those amendments. The sheer laziness of those amendments is obvious to everybody. You have had years to work out a policy, and you have not done it. What you are doing is putting an upward pressure on fees and keeping fees high, whereas our policy is a low fee policy. Our policy encourages parents to invest in education. The Labor Party want to stop parents investing in education and to push education investment down. That is the hypocrisy of their position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. The first quarterly business activity statement is due on 11 November. Those businesses that are not lodging electronically should submit their BAS and any payment by tomorrow, that is, Friday. Of course, if you are remitting electronically, you can do so across the electronic system, which will be operating on 11 November. This is a concessional lodgement date. The original date was 21 October 2000. As we get into the system, it will be the 21st day of the month after the end of the quarter.With regard to help, the tax office help lines have been operating at a very strong capacity. As the commissioner notes, call centres in Bankstown, Penrith and Liverpool have had 11,000 calls per day. The tax office has visited almost 300,000 businesses in Australia to help them with their first BAS form. As the commissioner has written in a number of newspaper articles, the tax office has made it clear that those people who make a genuine attempt to understand and meet their tax obligations will get fair and reasonable treatment from the tax office, which will give them the benefit of any doubt during the first year and accept at face value a genuine attempt to meet obligations - with the meaning that penalties will not apply where an honest mistake has been made.I would urge those businesses that have not already done so to do their BAS. They will find that it replaces 11 other systems of payment: provisional tax, company instalments, farm management deposits, pay as you earn, prescribed payment systems, reportable payment systems, TFN withholding, non-resident interest, dividend and royalties, mining withholding, natural resource withholding and withdrawals from Australian film industry trusts. A business that is involved in any or all of those systems can now do the one system under PAYG with their BAS, which is due in tomorrow. For those who are remitting through agents, as I have already informed the House, agents have the option, as long as they have 50 per cent of their clients in by 11 November, including their larger clients, to remit until the end of the month and still be on time. The government has already received monthly BASs from those companies that are in the monthly system for the three months that have already finished. This will be the first quarterly BAS for the smaller companies. The government will be updating its revenue forecasts on the back of receipts to date, and expects to be in a position to release a midyear review next week. The midyear review is a practice that was put in place by this government, whereby for the midyear we update our forecasts, announce changes in measures and update statements of revenues and expenditures with the budget outcome. It is expected that by the middle of next week - preferably on Wednesday of next week - the midyear economic outlook will be released by the government. Obviously, we will not have full returns from all the quarterly BASs, but the government will be using those returns that have been made, together with the monthlies, to put the best estimate of revenue from those collections in its midyear review. </DOC>

 - I do not accept the proposition that underpins the honourable gentleman's question. The government has enacted a large number of measures, including a new tax system, that have reduced the opportunities for tax evasion and tax avoidance in this country. Indeed, some of the anti-avoidance measures enacted by this government were opposed by the Australian Labor Party in the Senate; so the member for Lilley has no capacity at all to suggest that we have been soft on tax avoidance.In relation to the activities of Centrelink and others in relation to compliance, let me say this: it has never been, and never will be, the policy of this government to unfairly or unreasonably persecute people. It is not unreasonable, and it was a practice and attitude adopted by the Labor Party when it was in office, to ensure that people who are not entitled to claim social security benefits are not allowed to do so. I do not imagine that the member for Lilley is arguing that any government should turn a blind eye to instances where people have been improperly claiming social security benefits. I am not aware that the `flood' to which you refer is a consequence of any unreasonable conduct by the government. If people have proper examples to support that allegation, then I and my colleagues are very happy to investigate them.We have to strike a balance between, on the one hand, not being overzealous but, on the other hand, having a proper regard for the fact that we are dealing with taxpayers' money. The people that you look after in your electorate expect you and us to make sure that their dollars are spent wisely. They do not like their money going to people who are not entitled to it and they expect the government to chase that. But they expect the government, in chasing it, to be reasonable and fair and not unreasonable. I think that we have struck the right balance. We do care for the dollars of hard-working Australian men and women. The people who elected you as the member for Lilley do not want their hard-earned taxes squandered in payments to which people are not entitled. I simply say to the honourable member for Lilley that your concern for an equitable welfare system is noted, and I can assure you that the government will continue, as it has done in the past, to keep the balance right.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. -  - I acknowledge the enthusiasm of the opposition to hear the answer. - Mr Speaker, it is good to have an enthusiastic audience on the other side. - Mr Speaker, let us hope their enthusiasm does not force them later on to rise to their feet with a point of order to prevent the answer being given. Firstly, in respect of amalgamations, I do not think there is much doubt, or that anyone could in fact dispute, that the policy of super-unions, that was really forced through in the 1980s and perhaps the early 1990s by the previous Labor government, has been a disaster for many unions. It has been a disaster because it has elevated the elite - such as the then ACTU president and now member for Hotham, and the member for Batman - putting them out of reach and out of the way of the thinking of the rank and file. However, the fact is that the existing legislation allows for amalgamations, and whether or not the MUA is here to stay will of course depend on the views of the members.In contrast, I would have to say that our policy on this side is to make it easier for disamalgamations. The reason for that is quite simple: we believe that the rank and file, if they so desire, should have the opportunity in a vote for disamalgamation to create a union in which they have a greater say. I am not surprised that the elites on the other side are not in favour of that, but I can tell you that the rank and file do want to have a greater say and that whilst they are denied a greater say they will continue to leave the trade union movement - as they have been doing in droves in recent years. When the workers have a greater say, I put it to the House that as a result you will have unions that are more accountable, more transparent in their actions and, therefore, more responsive to the needs of the workers.If you have such a system in place, then I believe you will have more responsible trade unions and you will also have in place, by the voice of the rank and file, the means to restrain those union bosses who think that it is fair enough to hand out $450,000 of rank and file money to the Labor Party, which has been announced by the CFMEU. That is not the only example where we have a big union funding, and in fact buying, legislation from the Leader of the Opposition. The latest example involves a sum of money - which would be, conservatively, I am advised by my department, in excess of $100,000 - to provide for the member for Melbourne to pay for his legal expenses in a case which he is currently running.I have had some advice from my department that what could be said is that, prima facie, the funding of the member for Melbourne to pursue discovery of waterfront documents seems clearly at odds with undertakings given to the ACCC. My department further advises that the funding of one party to take forward the legal action on behalf of another party could appear to be an example of champerty - `an illegal sharing in the proceeds of litigation by one who promotes it' or where one party gets direct benefit from legal actions undertaken on its behalf by another. The member for Melbourne will not be surprised that I have sought legal advice on the legality of a deal which provides him personally with more than $100,000 to fund a political campaign in which he is the dummy, as usual, for the MUA.</DOC>

 - The question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is based on a whole lot of assumptions and contains a whole lot of assertions. Let me state a number of facts. The minister for finance has announced an external review of the outsourcing program, and I think that is a very sensible move. I indicate to the House that the idea of having an external review was suggested by my colleague. Once again, with his excitable aggression, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has allowed his exaggerated view of conspiracies and problems that do not exist to overcome his mastery of the facts and the sequence of events.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question today. Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and I will be attending the APEC meeting in Brunei during the course of next week. This meeting will have particular importance for many Australians because, at the APEC meeting, the government will be making very clear to the leaders of the Asia-Pacific region our concerns about high world oil prices and in particular the threat of unsustainable oil prices to the economies of the region. The East Asian countries have come through a very severe economic crisis. They are recovering, although in some cases that rate of recovery is beginning to slow. The high oil prices of recent times, particularly with international oil prices above $30 a barrel, have the potential to do great damage to those non-oil producing Asian economies. This should be a very significant component of the APEC discussions.Secondly, the government will also look to APEC to respond effectively to the challenges of the new economy. What we want to see in the APEC region is not a digital divide but a digital dividend. We want to ensure that all of the countries of APEC are able to develop their information and communications technology capability and that there is sufficient penetration of that technology to the broader communities throughout APEC. It would be unfortunate if over the years there were an increasing divide between countries such as the United States, Australia and Japan on the one hand and, on the other, those countries which have so far not been able for economic reasons to adopt information and communications technology to the extent of the developed countries.Thirdly, my colleague the Minister for Trade will be working to maintain a regional consensus in support of the World Trade Organisation in the difficult post-Seattle environment, and in particular to build support in APEC for a new global trade round as soon as possible. Finally, Australia will continue to assist the developing APEC economies manage the impact of globalisation through highlighting the linkages between economic reform and development and through the provision of our $5 million three-year Social Protection Facility. It has often been said in this chamber that APEC is the pre-eminent economic forum in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a very important forum and I think its importance can be underlined by a recent paper entitled `APEC regional trade and investment 2000', launched earlier today. It shows that Australia's exports to APEC increased by 16 per cent, to $71.2 billion, in 1999-2000. So this is a very important meeting that I think will continue to provide the momentum that APEC needs. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I should firstly point out to her and to the House the process. In fact, I took the CSIRO staff association through this process this morning in what I thought was a very constructive meeting. I took them through it as a result of an invitation I extended to them some considerable time ago to come and talk to me about outsourcing if they had some concerns. So the invitation was mine. The process is that any matter that is going to be considered for the purposes of market testing in the information technology and outsourcing program is firstly determined by the agencies themselves. The scope of the contracts is submitted by the agencies. This concern that has been expressed by members of the CSIRO for some time is in fact one that I believe required some attention on my part. Consequently, I invited the Acting Secretary of the CSIRO to my office about three to four months ago, and I made it clear that the government's intention in respect of the science agencies, and the CSIRO in particular, was to ensure that there was no diminution in scientific outcome. I made that abundantly clear to the acting secretary. I have said that publicly a number of times.Again, the process is that the agencies themselves will work through the scope of the contract as to what is relevant and what is not. That process is taking place and has been in other areas. Ultimately, a steering committee is established consisting of representatives of each of the agencies concerned. They must tick off those bids that are placed. That steering committee makes recommendations to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to the Department of Finance and Administration and to OASITO, and those recommendations ultimately come through for ministers themselves to consider. I know that in discussions I have with the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources we have particular regard to the science agencies' concerns, and there is no intention on the part of this government to foist upon any agency, let alone science agencies, an outcome that diminishes the scientific results and the work that those very valuable agencies of the government do. So a lot of mistruths have been pedalled about this. Very clearly there is a program that has all sorts of checks and balances in it, and it ensures that there is a proper process for market testing to bring about a more efficient and effective outcome, to promote the industry itself - that is, the IT sector - to ensure there is regional development and to encourage investment in this particular sector of our economy, and the investment has been significant. The jobs in regional Australia have been significant and the outcomes have brought about savings for taxpayers. There is a review, and that is entirely appropriate. That was foreshadowed when the program commenced back in 1997. - I would draw the attention of the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the fact that recommendation 3(a) of the ANAO report suggested that a process ought to be developed in respect of a review and evaluation. I take it seriously, and we are going through the normal process. I believe it is appropriate for someone external to government to do that review, and I have announced that. I look forward to the findings of that review because there is always room for improvement in any program, and I look forward to any advice that might be given to ensure that that review is there. But I assure you that we are looking for an outcome that represents value for money and that gives a more efficient and effective result that assists the IT sector of our economy and that assists all the agencies of government, including the CSIRO. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, before answering the question, can I seek your indulgence to welcome in the gallery a group of Torres Strait World War II veterans, members of the Torres Strait 1st Light Infantry Battalion, and some of the veterans' widows. They are guests here this afternoon courtesy of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence, and introduced by the member for Leichhardt. They are here to attend their first Remembrance Day ceremony in Canberra, on Saturday.This morning the government released the report of the community consultation team. I must say at the beginning that this is a very innovative way in which the government has gone about public policy formation. We were able to take right around Australia a team of people who have a deep knowledge of defence itself and we invited people to contribute, both in word and in writing, to the report that was made. Responses were received in the form of some 1,150 written submissions, and over 2,000 people attended 26 to 28 meetings spread right around Australia. Following the deployment to East Timor, the community interest and involvement in defence has been remarkably strong. Therefore, it is not surprising that these responses were both articulate, to the point and very supportive of the Australian defence effort. It was supportive in terms of the personnel that form the ADF in Australia; it also reflected support for some funding increases for the defence forces of the nation. More importantly, that funding was seen to be necessary, but most necessary was the management of that funding within the defence department - something which the government is giving very great attention to. This report forms a very good basis for the white paper to be presented on Wednesday, 6 December. Making good policy is important, and this report contributes to that - certainly from the way in which the team conducted its consultation around the nation. Finally, I would like to thank the members of the team - Andrew Peacock, David MacGibbon, Major General Clunies-Ross and Stephen Loosley - for the very great contribution that they made to it. All four people pay very great attention to both foreign and defence issues, and their contribution was most marked. On behalf of the government, I thank them and all the people who participated in the report.</DOC>

 - This question from the member for Dobell just highlights the intellectual bankruptcy of the Labor Party's approach to school funding, because of course the small Christian schools that the member for Dobell compared unfavourably with Prince Alfred College - in terms of the amount that they would be getting - will be getting considerably more funding per head than will go to the students at Prince Alfred College. They will be funded at a much higher proportion of government school costs. The member for Dobell would never mention that, because that is the fundamental reason why this policy of the government's is recognised as fair by every major religious grouping in Australia. The Labor Party never addresses the issue of real fairness. What also amazes me about the question from the member for Dobell is that he apparently dismisses, without even considering it, the points that are made by the principal of that school in relation to the school's financial viability and the school's capacity to set fee levels that are suitable for the present day parent community of that school.  The Labor Party's policy - and let us be quite clear about this - is to make sure that that school is locked into the highest possible fee structure, regardless of the impact of that structure on the financial viability of the school. The member for Dobell thinks it is clever to get up here and complain about the impact of the SES funding model on that school, which delivers to it a fair rate of per capita funding, without taking into account at all the consequences of the Labor Party's policy for that school. This question really highlights the difference between the opposition and the government.The opposition is not concerned with fairness. It is not concerned with lowering school fees. It is not concerned with making schools more accessible. It is not concerned with encouraging investment in schooling. It is concerned with dividing Australian schools into two groups, including those that are only going to be accessible to the well-to-do in the community - a group of elite schools that the Labor Party and its union mates can continue to hold up for the purposes of their appeals based on social envy. The Labor Party wants to lock that element into the schooling structure. It put it there painstakingly over 13 years in office. It froze the funding for these schools for 15 years. It was never concerned with the viability of these schools. It was never concerned to put any downward pressure on fees. Everything that it does is designed to create a set of elite schools that will be accessible to the very few. Labor leaders like Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and Simon Crean make good use of schools like Melbourne Grammar, they make good use of schools like Canberra Grammar and they make good use of schools like Wesley College. But they want to make sure that more and more parents do not get access to those schools; they want to make sure that fewer and fewer parents get access to those schools. Only the Labor elite can go to the Labor elite schools - but do not open them up to the community. I am proud that the government's policy is a very democratic policy of school funding that will spread access to schools, that will better resource Australian schools and that will lay the foundations in this country for a schooling system which will truly make us a society that can take advantage of the knowledge economy in the 21st century. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. Earlier today PHIAC released the figures for the September quarter and revised their figures for the June quarter. Previously they had advised that in the June quarter 41.2 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. In fact, the health funds had not been able to process the claims. They now say the figure for the June quarter was 43 per cent of Australians. This morning they have said that 45.8 per cent of Australians are now covered by private health insurance. This means that 8.8 million Australians are now enjoying the benefits of private health cover. Since December 1998, over 3.1 million Australians have joined private health cover. During the two-week extension in July for Lifetime Health Cover, over half a million Australians took advantage of the extension and joined private health funds. This is an incredible result. The increase since December 1998 is more than the total decline in the nine years under Labor, which had an ideologically driven health policy to let the private sector wither on the vine, without regard for the fact that our entire system was built on a balance between public and private. The member for Hinkler would be interested to know that in his own electorate around 48 per cent of people are now covered by private health insurance. This goes up to as high as 67 per cent for the electorate of the member for Sydney.  We did what we have done with private health insurance for two very specific reasons. The first is to give Australians choice. Australians value choice very much. Choice was eroded because private health insurance became unaffordable - the 30 per cent rebate has fixed that - and because people were taking a short-term view, which Lifetime Health Cover has fixed. The second thing we hoped to do was to, in the words of Bob Carr or Peter Beattie or Graham Richardson - all of whom have had to run health systems - restore some balance between the two sys-tems. We now estimate that, when the pre-existing ailment rules expire, 550,000 extra Australians will be able to access treat-ment in the private sector, although some of that will be as private patients in public hospitals. This will take pressure off the pub-lic hospital system in a way that was always intended when Medicare was originally designed. This gives us great reason for optimism. The government has further decided that, in spite of the fact that we would be entitled to claw back $1 billion from the states under the Australian health care agreements, we will not be clawing back this money. The states will be able to keep the full benefit of that. They will also keep the increased revenue coming from private patients in public hospitals. This revenue has been in decline for the best part of a decade. In the September quarter we are seeing the very first indications that it has flattened out, reversing a long-term trend, and it looks as though it will be increasing. So this is a new source of funds for public hospitals. It takes some pressure off public hospitals in the medium term, it is a long-term solution and it is very good news for Medicare. So we now have a safe, secure and healthy private health sector working alongside a public sector that can look forward to some prospect of having pressure taken off it -  - and the only risk to this is an ideologically driven Labor Party that does not want to see balance and choice in health care. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There are a significant number of these schools. With one or two exceptions they are certainly very small in my electorate, on a per capita basis, which is really the only significant factor that needs to be considered here. They are doing very, very much better under the arrangements that we have put in place than under those you had in place, and they appreciate it very much. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I note that last week she attended a very good function that was held by East Coast Training, a function from which the member for Dickson was conspicuously absent. What the member for Dickson needs to understand is that every time she attacks the Job Network's operations, she is not attacking the government but she is attacking organisations like the Salvation Army, Mission Australia, Centacare and private sector organisations based in Queensland such as Sarina Russo Job Access, Work Directions and so on - organisations that constitute the heart of the Job Network. In April, the member for Dickson told the House that Job Network members were `taking only the most easy cases because their private providers' margins depend on this'. Last week she told the House:... every extra dollar that is kept as a profit by a provider means that one less dollar is spent on training the unemployed.So she is accusing Job Network members of profiteering. Last week she said:I hear time and time again that, especially if you are a mature age job seeker ... there is a very significant chance that you will be `parked'.Again, another accusation against Job Network members. Then she said last week in the House:A lot of people have recently told me that they are extremely dissatisfied because they have been unfairly breached while registered with Job Network members.Again, a very serious accusation against Job Network members, for which she cannot produce a shred of evidence. This is what she tells the House, and then she had the gall to come into the chamber yesterday and say:... the Minister for Employment Services misrepresented me when he said that I had attacked Job Network providers ...She does nothing but attack Job Network providers. The injured innocence she goes on with! What can we say about the member for Dickson except that she is suffering from TDD - truth deficit disorder? That is her problem. I have got to say she has got a very bad case of it even by the standards of the Queensland ALP.</DOC>

 - I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his question, which I might say was not entirely unexpected. Can I remind the honourable member that in recent weeks I have myself specifically referred through the Minister for Justice and Customs to the Federal Police two sets of allegations. One is the one you referred to in your question - that is, the one that appeared in the Courier Mail. One of the reasons why I referred that matter to the Federal Police is that the Queensland Premier said the day before I referred it to the Federal Police that it ought to be referred to the Federal Police. That is one of the reasons.The second matter that I referred to the Federal Police through the minister, which is the correct procedure in relation to referrals by the Prime Minister and other ministers, was the allegations made by Mr Brian Courtice, the former member for Hinkler, in relation to claims he made concerning I think the 1984 election in the seat of Hinkler when he ran against Mr Brian Conquest. So the scorecard, if you like, on referrals by me to the Federal Police is one set of allegations involving the Australian Labor Party and one set of allegations involving people on our side of politics.Can I say in relation to other allegations that it is open to anybody, as the Manager of Opposition Business knows, to refer any allegations that see the light of day. As a member of parliament, you do not need the say-so of the Prime Minister to refer something to the Federal Police. If you as the member for the seat you represent or as a private citizen wish to refer something to the Federal Police, you can do so by writing directly to them. - The notion which is implicit in the question asked by the honourable member that somehow or other it has got to go through me is quite false. It is absolutely false. If you look at the record, I have referred allegations against my side of politics to the Federal Police and I have referred allegations against your side of politics to the Federal Police. - The two things have been handled in a completely even-handed fashion. If you are unhappy about other things, if you want to refer allegations to which you made reference in your question to the Federal Police, you can. It does not need my say-so, and it is indeed quite inappropriate that you imply that it does. I have handled this matter in a completely even-handed fashion. And the only thing I would add is that I think the members of the Liberal preselection committee in the seat of Menzies made an excellent decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore. I know he has got a very keen interest in employment matters and is a very good representative in Western Australia. No wonder he has got a keen interest, because under the coalition government unemployment rates are still at 6.3 per cent - the lowest for many years. It is encouraging to note that this year 85,000 Newstart recipients moved off Newstart into employment. What is also encouraging is that in regard to our preparing for work agreement, which we introduced in October last year, since July this year over 200,000 job seekers have signed their preparing for work agreements. This is an important agreement because it outlines the obligations and sends a very clear message to job seekers on what is required, and also it is done to help target them to get into employment as quickly as possible. I am a little surprised to hear some of the comments being made by the Australian Labor Party. The member for Lilley has been talking about the level of breaches happening at the moment. Under the Labor Party's policy when they were in government, when someone on Newstart allowance got a breach they lost their payments totally. - Exactly as the Prime Minister has said: we would have thought you were more compassionate. You masquerade as being compassionate. When we were elected into government, we introduced a fairer system on breaching, and that was a gradual reduction, where you had three chances before you lost your entitlements. It is interesting that at the moment the member for Lilley claims that one in two job seekers are in breach. This could not be further from the truth. Of the 1.3 million people who received Newstart allowance in the last financial year, 86 per cent did the right thing: they fulfilled their mutual obligation requirements, which is particularly important to maintain the integrity of the social security system, which is funded by the Australian taxpayers. - They are complaining about it, but they actually voted for the legislation. The member for Lilley actually supported these breaching measures when they came through in 1997. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. Importantly, what we have done is to ensure that, if there is a view that perhaps a breach is unfair, there is a process of appeal: with Centrelink, with the SSAT, where fewer than one per cent go through, and finally with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I can perhaps understand why the member for Lilley and other members of the Labor Party are concerned about breaching. Every day we are now seeing your friends in the AWU and your Queensland Labor mates breaching the Electoral Act.</DOC>

 - Let me first make this point: I and the government regard with the utmost seriousness any allegations of child abuse in the community, in a detention environment or elsewhere. Matters of that sort are very serious and when they are raised the people who are best able to deal with them should investigate them. In South Australia, for instance, that is the division of family and youth services in the Department of Human Services. In relation to the situation at the Woomera Detention Centre, there have been a large number of allegations over a period of time about, in the main, a small number of specific instances and more generalised allegations that are designed to promote a wider degree of interest in these matters. The fact is that there were investigations carried out in South Australia by the Department of Human Services, as a result of reports that were being made. There were investigations also undertaken by the police. While I do not have the specific dates, I think they commenced as early as April this year. In relation to those matters, with the information that was then to hand, there were no findings on which any charges could be brought. When further information is brought to our attention, if it raises new issues which have not been previously examined, we will arrange for that material to be brought to the attention of the people best charged with dealing with those matters. In relation to a specific document, which had not previously been brought to the attention of the state Department of Human Services - my department ascertained that the document was not before the South Australian department - arrangements were made, I think on Monday of last week, for that document to be brought to the attention of the South Australian Department of Human Services. It was as a result of finding that that document had not been previously seen by the authority, and that it may raise - it may not necessarily substantiate the claims - matters that require further investigation that I took the view -  - When it was clear that that document was one which had some matters that required further examination, I instigated an inquiry. I have today announced the terms of reference for that inquiry into the procedures by which these matters are dealt with and also to look at how those procedures would have operated in relation to these specific allegations, to facilitate the inquiry. - The fact is that there have been a wide range of generalised allegations -  - There have been a wide range of specific allegations and generalised allegations over a period of time. When those matters are raised, they are examined. I do not know the specific dates upon which people might write to me and bring matters to my attention. When they are brought to my attention, I refer them to my department for appropriate investigation. There is nothing unusual about that, because I note that the Leader of the Opposition is alleged to have received the same letters that have been written to me - and even to this point in time he has not brought those matters to my attention to seek any investigation of them.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that, between you and me, yes, I am aware. I am aware of the great importance of investing in the country's economic and infrastructure future. That is why, along with the Deputy Prime Minister, today I announced the injection of an additional $1.6 billion to upgrade the local road network of the Australian nation. This injection of money represents a 75 per cent increase in the amount of money being committed by the federal government to the local roads of Australia. It represents the greatest single increase ever in local road funding by any federal government in this country. Contrary to the absurd and premature claims of the Leader of the Opposition, this is not a pork-barrelling favouritism exercise for the rural and regional electorates of Australia. I have had drawn to my attention that three councils in Western Australia - one of them is called Kwinana, one of them is called Mandurah, and one of them is called the City of Rockingham - are wholly or partly in the division of Brand, which is held by the Leader of the Opposition, and will between them receive $4.75 million. Undoubtedly, the Leader of the Opposition will be inviting those councils to send the pork back to Canberra. That is what the Leader of the Opposition will be doing.  The truth is that this is a package which, in relation to the packet of money going to each state, is going to be distributed in accordance with a formula established when the Labor government was in power. It is not a formula within each state which has been devised by the coalition parties to help coalition seats. If the member for Capricornia thinks this is such a pro Liberal-National Party package, maybe she wants the $21.9 million that is going to councils within or touched by the division of Capricornia to be returned. Perhaps the normally loquacious member for Hotham wants to return the $9.6 million going to the councils in his division. Or indeed the member for Paterson, who is never short of an interjection, might want to return the $8.8 million going to the councils in the division of Paterson.Never let it be forgotten that, when I made the announcement, this is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say: `not to fund a boondoggle for the National Party, which is what is going on here'. Can I say to Kirsten Livermore then: `Welcome to the National Party. We are going to fund $21.9 million for your division.' And listen to this comment. I am sure everyone at the Local Government Association annual gathering here in Canberra next week is going to love this comment made on 12 November in South Perth - I wonder whether he was in the City of Rockingham - by the Leader of the Opposition: `if he merely spends it on roads'. That shows the mindset. When you say `merely' spending it on something, you think the expenditure is irrelevant, trivial and unnecessary, don't you? You do not regard it as a valuable piece of infrastructure. The Leader of the Opposition also said, `I think there's a stench of pork about the whole handling of this issue.' So there is a stench of pork about distributing something in accordance with a Labor Party formula!But we should not be surprised that the Labor Party should have such a strange array of reactions in relation to this matter. Only this morning the Leader of the Opposition was asked about this issue. His attention was drawn to the fact that the announcement does include the provision that something in the order of $350 million out of the $1.2 billion will go to councils in the greater metropolitan area. Every single council in Australia will benefit, not only the country councils but also the city councils. They will benefit in a graduated way according to need. It is a fair and decent package that will help the road infrastructure of Australia. But this is what the Leader of the Opposition also had to say, and it showed the clarity that he brings to these matters. Listen very carefully because it contains within it the germs of an alternative policy. - It does, believe it or not. It has surfaced. He had this to say, and listen carefully: But we reserve the right to isolate any elements of this which constitute pork barrel and included in the funding arrangements to deal with petrol in the way in which we think and we will announce by the next election ought to be dealt with.That is the Labor Party's policy. I suppose, true to his style, what the Leader of the Opposition will say is: that is exactly the answer I wanted. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition, to use a colloquialism, jumped the gun on this issue. He made a false allegation. He has now been revealed as being absolutely in a ridiculous position. This is a fair package. It is a package that is going to help every part of Australia and I look forward to the Labor Party expediting its passage through the parliament.</DOC>

 - The fact is that, while I cannot be precise as to the nature of the dates and times upon which particular reports might be made to me by departmental officers -  - I don't think it is. - or complaints made in writing or allegations made to my departmental officials or their officers, I expect that when those issues are raised they will be pursued appropriately by those who have received the information. When you ask what information I have received, and you want detailed information -  - Even as to when, I will initiate a search to ascertain what information we have received. - Let me make the point I made earlier: matters have been the subject of substantial investigation by the police and by Family and Youth Services in South Australia in relation to allegations where there was specific evidence of a substantial character that required investigation. As a result of those investigations, no charges were brought and no children were taken into care. It was only as a result of further information, which my department disclosed last week to Family and Youth Services in South Australia, that a further inquiry was initiated. We take the issue of child abuse, wherever it occurs, very seriously. You will not find any want of application on our part in dealing with those matters.Let me make one further point: I think there also needs to be a degree of care about the way in which these generalised allegations are made. There have been a lot of people in detention, some of them found to be refugees. One or two specific instances relating to specific individuals ought not to be used as a basis for generalised charges and claims which reflect upon the generality of the people who have been detained. Nor do I think it is reasonable for people who have a view about detention policy and who are seeking to unwind it to unnecessarily and inappropriately reflect upon the integrity and professionalism of officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or those people with whom we contract. There is clearly a good deal of innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations about the detention centres and this seems to have a wider purpose. Where there have been specific matters of substance where people have first-hand information that warrants investigation, those investigations have been proceeded with. Where there is any suggestion of any lack of application on our part, I have arranged for those matters to be further examined.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He and many other members in this place have raised the importance of local roads with me on many occasions - the member for New England, the member for Dawson, the member for Blair; I can think of any number, so I had better not start. It has been constantly raised. Indeed, it has even been raised in many ways by people like the member for Paterson. The member for Paterson is not in the chamber now, but a few moments ago he made some scoffing remarks about how unnecessary this package was and that it would probably go to building a superhighway to Kirribilli House. He has scuttled out - I should imagine, to reassure the people from the councils of Dungog, who will get from this about $1½ million dollars; Gloucester, about $1½ million; and Great Lakes, about $2½ million dollars. The mayor in Gloucester has just said that it is the best thing the federal government has done for many years for him and for his council. And so it goes on - nearly $2 million for Maitland and $2 million for Port Stephens. The member for Paterson was in here narrowcasting one message - that it is not necessary, or that it is a pork barrel, or that it is trivial or unnecessary work, or whatever the case may be - but he has scuttled out to reassure his own councils that this is of course needed. That is what he has done. The member for Page asked: what will it mean? I have travelled many of those roads in the member for Page's area. I know what they are like. I know particularly how badly they deteriorate after a bit of rain. They have been subjected to many years of neglect. Many of these roads are like the capilliaries of the body - the blood vessels that are so important to the corporate health of the whole - and the fact is that they were built in the fifties and sixties and have been allowed to deteriorate. Oh, the member for Paterson is back. That was a quick call to all the local councils out there, was it? - Let us see you now carry the courage of your convictions and say that the seat of Paterson does not really need the money; it is trivial and unnecessary. - Yes, that will go down very well, as the Prime Minister observed. Many of these roads, built in the fifties and sixties, have reached the end of their service life. Many of them were designed for a life of around 30 years, particularly those that were given bitumen seals, and councils are now faced with a situation where they just cannot maintain them. Indeed, one council told me that, instead of resheeting on a 30-year cycle, they have been reduced to an 80-year cycle. This of course will make a very dramatic difference. The truth is that councils everywhere will benefit, and so will people. In the building, construction and upgrading of roads, jobs will be created - a significant number of jobs. Inasmuch as economic, value adding and trade benefits flow from that, further jobs will be created further down the road.It should also be pointed out that there are a lot of social aspects to local roads, particularly in rural and regional and remote areas, where families do not have the option of being able to go down to the corner and catch a train, a cab, or bus as the case may be. Indeed, as one rural person from South Australia has put it to me, so many of the local railways have gone that they are more dependent upon the roads than ever, and so, whether it is getting the kids to school, a trip to the doctor, a social outing or whatever, local roads are very important. One other point that ought to be made is that, if local roads are in good condition, they save not only lives - the better the condition, the fewer lives that are lost or put at risk - but a lot of wear and tear on cars and, dare I say, petrol, too.The honourable member asked about alternative positions. Can I say that it has been a bit difficult to really discern any coherent position at all. We had what the Prime Minister called the germ of another policy idea in some comments made by the Leader of the Opposition a little while ago. But the truth is that, like a lot of loose ball bearings on the workshop floor - rolling around, trying to find a place to rest, trying to find a constant position - those opposite have not been able to make up their minds where they stand. The member for Batman has been out there for months, saying that the coalition must spend more money on rural infrastructure. That is what he has been saying. The minute it happens, what happens? The Leader of the Opposition came out on the Sunday when we indicated that there would be more money spent on local roads, and said that it was just a `boondoggle' for the National Party. Then, discovering that that might be an insult to rural people - because, according to the Collins dictionary, it actually means `trivial or unnecessary works' - he revised it the next day to say that he just meant pork-barrelling. So now he wants to insult rural people by saying it is pork-barrelling. The Leader of the Opposition uses are a lot of words. I think it is worth making the comment that -   - Yes, you have to get the dictionary out each time; that is a very useful interjection from the other side. I freely admit that I did not know what a boondoggle was. The Leader of the Opposition clearly did try to have it two ways. On the Monday, he said it was a pork barrel; the day before it had been trivial and unnecessary. But George Megalogenis has revealed that, when he was leaving the press gallery in Canberra - as I understand it, to go to Melbourne - in September 1999, the Leader of the Opposition wrote to him and said:Your departure is no boondoggle.We assume that he did not mean `your departure is no pork barrel'; we assume that he meant it was no trivial and unnecessary thing. You had better come clean, Leader of the Opposition. Is a boondoggle a trivial and unnecessary thing, or is it a pork barrel? Plainly, it is not a pork barrel. We have seen that. You only have to look casually across Queensland: for example, at the seat of Blair, $16 million; Capricornia, $21 million; Maranoa, $51 million. If you then look at the funding formula that the Prime Minister has been referring to, it is an honest formula. It is a formula that meets needs rather than political ends. It will be very widely welcomed for the very serious and worthwhile exercise that it is.</DOC>

 - The situation is that there were investigations by the relevant authorities who have the capacity to require that young people who may be the subject of abuse are removed if they are in danger. The investigations that were undertaken did not substantiate that there was such a danger in relation to the young person involved. There were thorough investigations by Family and Youth Services as well as by the South Australian police.  -  - I do not investigate these matters and I do not think you would regard me as being the expert person to do so. - I will help members with some advice as to what is expected in these matters. A large number of people in and around the detention centre in South Australia have certain responsibilities. South Australian law requires that, if people employed in a number of occupations suspect on reasonable grounds that a child is being or has been abused or neglected and if that suspicion is formed in the course of that person's work, they must notify Family and Youth Services as soon as practicable after they form that view. The persons who are required to report abuse include medical practitioners, pharmacists, enrolled and registered nurses, dentists, psychologists, members of the police force, social workers, teachers, government employees and employees of non-government bodies who are charged with delivering particular services, including residential services.  Australian Correctional Management employs two medical practitioners, 13 nurses, two counsellors and a teacher at Woomera, and they have certain obligations. These matters are becoming matters of wider public comment now. However, as to the specific issues that were raised in March and April, investigations were undertaken and the responsible authorities formed no view that the young person ought to be removed from the care of his father. That situation was reassessed only when a further document came to light in circumstances that prompted the investigation that I have announced.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Since the House last sat, the government has released its midyear economic and fiscal outlook for 2000-01. I can advise the House that the government has revised up slightly its growth forecasts for the current financial year, with exports making a substantial impact on our growth - a one percentage point contribution - which is the first positive contribution to growth from exports since the Asian financial crisis. In addition, the government revised up its expectations of surplus to $4.3 billion on a cash basis - $1.5 billion higher than estimated at budget - and $8.4 billion in fiscal terms. This reflected increases in expected revenue collections, principally coming from strong company profits - which, in this economic environment, are amongst the highest ever recorded in Australia. The government continues its plan to pay off Labor's debt. In its last five budgets, the Labor Party accumulated $80,000 million in debt. This government has not borrowed a dollar in net terms since it came to office and, by the end of the year, it will have repaid $50 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt. Moody's commented on the midyear review as follows: The AAA domestic debt rating is well supported by the current fiscal policy framework, positive fiscal balance and a low and declining public sector debt burden. From our perspective, the mid-year review provides further evidence of these favourable trends. I think there was even an unintentional word of congratulation from the Leader of the Opposition who, after the midyear review came out on 15 November, was quoted as saying, `We don't have a debt problem.' We may not have much of a debt problem now after we have paid back $50 billion, but we were certainly not in that position after the Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance, ended his reign by having accumulated $23 billion of debt in just two years while he was responsible for Commonwealth finances.The kind of investment that this government can make in the roads of Australia is a consequence of good economic management. It was not possible earlier when the government did not have its own books in order, and it could not have been done at a time when the budget was haemorrhaging, as it was when the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister. One pay-off for good economic management is the kind of investment that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have just talked about. In line with the growing economy, we can continue to reduce unemployment, which is now at a 10-year low. If we continue to run the Australian economy, we can take it even lower. I must draw the attention of the House to one of the more bizarre musings that I have seen in recent times from a Mr P.J. Keating, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 November 2000. In his letter, Mr P.J. Keating, one-time Treasurer of Australia and inspiration to the current Labor frontbench, had this to say: Alan Ramsey reminds everyone ... of the anniversary of the beginning of the recession of 1990. He uses this to draw a link to recent statements by the Treasurer, Peter Costello.  In his cynicism, he fails to mention that the recession set up the economy for its longest and strongest period of growth in 100 years. Mr Keating is still boasting about how he put Australia into recession and about all the alleged benefits that that is supposed to have brought to the Australian community. It has taken us 10 years to recover from the Labor Party recession, and its architect is still boasting about his handiwork. That handiwork put the unemployment rate up to 11.3 per cent, the budget peaked at a $17 billion deficit and we accumulated $80 billion worth of debt. Yet Labor is still boasting about the way in which it put Australia into recession. That is the claim from Labor's inspiration and leader.There have been Treasurers and Prime Ministers in the past who have suffered recession because of international factors and have tried to avoid them. I have never heard anyone boast about producing a recession, except for the Labor Party. They boast about it as an achievement. Here we are 10 years after the event and they are still claiming that one of their great achievements was to put the Australian economy into recession and to peak unemployment at 11.3 per cent. When this government was elected we set about undoing the damage of Labor; we set about repaying the debt. They fought us every single step of the way - and the best thing that can be said for them is that they failed.</DOC>

 - The member for Barton is quite right: I did write to the member for Denison on the day he asked me the question about the closure of the unit in the AFP. I explained, as advised to me by Senator Vanstone, that the Melbourne office of the AFP had integrated paedophile investigations with the way the AFP manages its work. It adopts a flexible team approach throughout the AFP very successfully. This is the same method that is used for the highly successful drug investigations that have resulted in a significant number of drug hauls.What has transpired since that letter I am unable to date to say, but I will inquire of Senator Vanstone. The AFP runs all its operations on this flexible team approach. It does not have units segregated. You have people moving from one team to another. It did have, and that was an exception, but there is now no exception in respect of paedophile investigations. But I will inquire of Senator Vanstone and, if there is anything further to be said, I will advise the honourable member.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have been up to his electorate in recent times where, amongst other things, we announced $20 million for a RONI, a road of national importance. His question rightly asks whether the Queensland state government have yet matched that. Have they?  - That is pork barrelling too! I notice that that region will now benefit from around $7½ million under the new program, which I know will be widely appreciated as well.There is no doubt that, if the state governments were to similarly recognise the importance of local government road funding and local road funding in the way that we have, we really could see some quite dramatic action. To come to some states, Victoria is a case in point. Historically, the federal government contributes around 16 per cent of funding for Victoria in local roads, but the Bracks government's contribution is just three per cent. That is all it is: three per cent. To put that into numbers, the federal government's allocation of $250 million - that is what it will be - for Victorian local roads over the next four years, on top of their existing FAGs allocation, really does make Mr Bracks's $14 million contribution look a bit thin. - Yes, that is right, $14 million. So we are putting in $250 million over and above the normal grants, and Mr Bracks is just going to put in $14 million. We challenge him to do better. I have met councils in his electorate that tell me that their tar resealing program has had to be reduced from the appropriate 30-year cycle to an 80-year cycle. So I think there would be real benefits in Victoria doing better.The Beattie government in Queensland is not doing much better. They throw in just five per cent of funding on Queensland's local roads. Ours was double that at 10 per cent. So, on top of that, we are now allocating an additional $250 million - serious money indeed - over four years to local roads in Queensland. It has to be said that that is a somewhat better performance than Mr Bacon in Tasmania, who does not give anything at all.Then there is New South Wales. New South Wales does have a slightly better record - I would be to first to admit that; always fair on this - but I have to say that, amazingly, on hearing that the federal government were intending to increase funding for local roads, the New South Wales minister immediately sent me a great long list of all the roads that he wanted funded under the program. As we have made quite plain, we are not going to get into that business of political considerations here. But the other interesting point about it was that he listed his own outline of roads that he wanted funded - and there was not a local road amongst them. So he plainly belongs in Mr Beazley's camp: they are boondoggles, trivial and unnecessary.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I -  - Yes, it is a big day out; that is right. I would be the first to admit it is good fun. We have some good news. And the people of Dawson have welcomed this announcement. There is no doubt of the capacity of local governments in the Dawson electorate to significantly accelerate some much needed programs. Councils will have the flexibility to undertake a very broad spectrum of works and approaches: bitumen sealing of dirt roads, reconstruction of roads to ensure all-weather access, bridge strengthening to carry heavier vehicles and development of strategic freight routes. That is important. Local councils may choose to combine with others - indeed, even with the private sector - in areas where forestry is beginning to boom, for example, and where some added local road infrastructure could see a much more rapid acceleration of economic development and jobs in any given region. Then there is the construction of new roads to help with things like tourism which, in many parts of Queensland in particular, is being very actively pursued by local communities. In that sense, it fits very well with one of the priorities that was identified at the Regional Australia Summit last year.I was interested to note that representation from the member for Dawson for the Bowen Shire Council in Queensland highlights what a typical council might hope to achieve with a significant boosting of their funding. They hope to re-lay the surface of 15 vital local roads and to undertake capital works on roads to hospitals and important road connectors to major centres like Brisbane. There is quite a list; I have actually seen it. They will go a very long way indeed towards achieving their wish list. I suspect they will achieve virtually all of it under the program that we have put out. This will benefit the economy and the people of that electorate very significantly. I have no doubt that the people of Dawson would want those opposite to facilitate the passage of the legislative requirements to enable this to happen in the most useful way and the most straightforward way. That is what local governments want and that is what the people that they represent want.</DOC>

 - As I think the Leader of the Opposition knows and as I have had confirmed to me since I made that comment, it is possible to indicate the impact on the excise collection, but because the price of petrol is a fluctuating price and because consumption patterns can alter it is simply not possible to do a disaggregation of the GST on petrol from the GST on other items. - If the Leader of the Opposition had read the remainder of the transcript, he would have also noticed that I drew attention to the fact that the excise compensation arrangements for the GST were based on an assumed or strike price of 90c a litre. - Oh, it was wrong. I see. It was based on a strike price of 90c a litre. The point I made to the listeners of 3AW -  - and the point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition is that, to the extent that at some time in the future the price of petrol falls below 90c a litre and remains below 90c a litre, far from the new taxation arrangements leading to an increase in the price of petrol, in fact the arrangements - because they were based on a strike price of 90c a litre - could indeed result in there being, as a result of the GST, a reduction in the GST excise take under the arrangements applying to the price of petrol. So I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition against taking, as they always do, a short-term view of these things. The predictions being made by many people indicate that the price of petrol might well fall. The price of crude oil might well fall in the months ahead and the impact of that on the arrangements we set up when the GST was introduced would turn out to be extremely beneficial. And, once again, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be demonstrated as having shot the gun. </DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for his question. In fact, I recognise the great interest the member has shown in the whole question of climate change and the COP6 conference, which I think he attended as an observer. -  - He was one of the observers who actually regularly attended and took a great interest in the sessions as they took place. The government regret that it was not possible to reach a final agreement in The Hague on the outstanding issues in the Kyoto protocol. The government have taken a very constructive approach to the whole question of climate change. We believe the international community needs to address it, and we believe Australia should make a fair contribution. We diverge from those who believe that Australia should make an unfair contribution or that we should make a disproportionate contribution, sacrifice more jobs proportionately and sacrifice more of our living standards than other countries should. It is not reasonable to ask the Australian public to bear a heavier burden than the publics of other developed countries. We have agreed to targets. That was done in Kyoto some time ago. We wish to meet the targets, and we wish the international community to meet the targets, causing a minimum of damage in terms of both jobs and the living standards of our people.At the meeting in The Hague, Senator Hill did his usual very professional job in leading the Australian delegation. Indeed, his work was complimented by the chairman of the meeting, Minister Pronk of the Netherlands. Senator Hill played a particularly important role as the chair of what is called the `Umbrella group', which includes us, the United States, Japan, Canada and five other countries. We very much appreciate the constructive role that Senator Hill, Ambassador Hillman, our Ambassador for the Environment, and others played.In the final stages of the negotiation, the `Umbrella group' and the European Union came very close to reaching agreement on the key issues which were before the conference in The Hague: on domestic action to be taken to address greenhouse, on emissions trading, on sinks and on the question of compliance, though there is frankly still some way to go on the issue of the role of the developing countries in the whole process of the protocol. It is unfortunate that in the end internal disagreements amongst European Union member states meant that the European Union was, after all, unable to sign up to the deal. The conference has now concluded, and it has been agreed to resume the conference probably but not definitely in Bonn in May next year. We will be looking to the meeting in Bonn, and we hope that it will be possible for the details of the package to finally be put together. But it is important for the House to understand that this meeting in The Hague got very close to finality and to a successful agreement, and it is unfortunate that only disagreements within the European Union ultimately led to it being impossible to conclude the agreement we had hoped to get.</DOC>

 - I think this matter has been well and truly canvassed. As the midyear economic and fiscal outlook showed, the take from excise was less than foreshadowed at the budget. - Mr Speaker, I think I was 15 seconds into answering his question when he decided to try and interrupt. As the midyear review showed, the take from excise is actually less than forecast in the budget. He then goes on to say that the Treasury secretary said something to the contrary. The Treasury secretary was so misreported by the Sydney Morning Herald that he put out a statement, one of the strongest statements I have ever seen in my life, where he said that the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald was a lie - that was the word that he used - and he went through the way in which the story had been misreported. I cannot actually put my hand on his press release at the moment -  - I cannot put my hand on the press release that the Treasury secretary put out last week. He has a big point now, Mr Speaker - a real big point. Anyway, it is on the record, it was put out and I think all of the media are aware of it. I certainly hope the Sydney Morning Herald is aware of it. Let us come now to the indexation point, which will take place in February next year under the Labor Party legislation. That is a point you never hear. The government does not amend anything. The government does not introduce a rate. All the government -  - We can adjust it, he says.  - Our task in life is to amend the Labor Party's legislation which it put in place in 1983 and never once adjusted. It never once adjusted its legislation so it is now our obligation to do so.Not only did they introduce the excise indexation, but when the indexation was not enough - and the indexation in the 1980s was eight per cent per annum - do you know what the Labor Party did? It came in and put it up by 5c a litre in the 1993 election. Then the Leader of the Opposition says - and this is his absolute, latest thing - `if I was in government I would change it next February.' He is making promises from opposition about what he would do when he knows he is not in office. He does not actually go out and say what he would do if he were elected; he does not say, `I give a pledge that the moment I am elected I will go out and I will do such and such.' - I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his point of order because it gave me a chance to find the press release of the Secretary of the Treasury, which I think was their big point. I table it, Mr Speaker. It is under the headline, `The Sydney Morning Herald is wrong' and says:  The headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald claiming that I had agreed that the GST is the culprit in the rise and rise of petrol is a straight lie. That is the Secretary of the Treasury. No wonder the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, knowing that that release had been put up, came to the dispatch box and asked the question - relying on that report as if it were the truth, knowing that the Secretary of the Treasury had put out a statement saying it was a lie. It is the kind of material that we are used to from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, frankly, he shames the Labor Party with his conduct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. He is a great champion for small business in his seat. That is good for small business and it is great for the whole community in his seat because it means more jobs and greater prosperity. I compliment him on the work that he does. Small business will be delighted with the road funding announcement today because, if you are in small business and you want to get your goods to your markets, under the coalition you will have better roads. And what will the Labor Party do? If they are elected they will be taking the money back. That would be their view, because they see it all as a bit of pork-barrelling. Helping small business is the last thing that the Labor Party would want to do. I thank the member for his question. We did have a constructive meeting. We looked at various aspects of small business, including electronic commerce. We are concerned about indigenous people in small business, and of course we are looking at duplication to save small business red tape so that they can get on with their jobs. Business is also an important issue. The meeting was well attended by members from the coalition side of politics. For example, showing and demonstrating the importance of small business we had, from Western Australia, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia - obviously a member of cabinet. That is how important it is from Western Australia's point of view. From South Australia we had the Treasurer of South Australia because a coalition Treasurer knows the importance of small business to the economy. From the ACT we had the new Deputy Chief Minister. From the Northern Territory we had Tim Baldwin, the Minister for Small Business, who again is a great champion for small business. At the Commonwealth level, as members know, small business is represented in the cabinet. And why? Because this government gives priority to small business and it is important that the small business point of view be strongly heard. I am sad to say, however, that that basically was the full list of attendees at that meeting. Not one single Labor Party state minister for small business attended the meeting. Nowhere in the Labor Party at the state level could they find a minister to represent the interests of small business. You can only take from that that the Labor parties at the state level in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania have taken a line from the member for Brand who said:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.How right he is and how sad it is for the small business community that they do not get the representation that they deserve. And what does the shadow minister at the federal level say about small business? He is singing a very different tune. At this year's Labor conference he said that the Labor Party, state and federal, has `stepped up its bid for small business and rural support'. They say one thing and do another. They were not even prepared to turn up to a regional centre - which is, again, very important for small business - to represent the interests of small business. This just demonstrates Labor's real attitude to small business. Quite frankly, they could not care less about it, and they will prove it again when we introduce our bill on unfair dismissals for small business. What will the Labor Party do? They will vote against it again, because they are not interested in promoting small business. </DOC>

 - It is well worth putting the facts on the table in relation to this. The honourable member might be puzzled, after reading that out, to hear how the petrol excise was 6c per litre in 1983 when the Labor Party came to office and how when the Labor Party left office in 1996 it was 34c a litre. Since the Labor Party was giving back windfalls people might be worried about how it went from 6c a litre under the Labor Party to 34c. Indexation was introduced by Mr Paul Keating in his budget of August 1983, and this is what he said:As a second step towards countering the declining trend in real excise revenues - This is when excise was 6c a litre - the Government is introducing from tonight a system of six-monthly indexation of traditional excise rates ...This measure will allow for the maintenance of the real value of excise rates in a non-destabilising fashion.Listen to this - this is why you introduced indexation:Previous erratic reactions to the declining trend in collections, most notably in 1978, have destabilised the sales patterns of the industries concerned, imposed sudden and large increases on consumers ...So in 1983 that legislation, which the Labor Party operated under for 13 years, was only being introduced to help consumers. After indexation was introduced in 1983, in 1986 a funny thing happened - the world price of oil fell. Do you know what the Labor Party said? The Labor Party said if the world price of oil falls we put up excise. That was the argument. On 16 April 1986, because the world price of oil had gone down, they lifted the excise rates 5.329c per litre in one hit. Then when the price of oil had gone down further by May of 1986 they lifted the excise 2.622c per litre. Then they raised it again in 1986. After that, the public said, `If you've got to raise the excise because the price of oil falls, what should you do when the price of oil goes up?' The Labor Party said, `It is only fair that we take those increases off' - not the indexation but the increases that they put in place as a result of falls in world oil prices. This is what they did. They put the price up by 11.9c because the price of world oil had fallen. When world oil went back up what did they bring it down by? Not 11.9 but 7.6. Then when it became obvious that the oil price -  - it was a 4.3 per cent increase - would continuously rise thereafter they gave up this system. When the oil price came down the Labor Party put the excise up, and as the oil price went up the Labor Party abandoned the system - with a net 4.3 per cent increase. Indexation then continued - 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993. Then we got to the famous 1993 budget. Notwithstanding the fact that they had had full indexation for 13 years, they decided in the 1993 budget to, over and above indexation, increase the petrol excise by 5c. This was not indexation. The Labor Party actually had to introduce a law to say that indexation was not enough, the fiddle on the world oil price was not enough. They were actually engaging in discretionary increases which were at the time pledged by and defended by the Minister for Finance. This government has never had a discretionary increase in petrol excise. Never once did we have a discretionary increase in petrol excise. This government has left in place the historic indexation arrangements that were in place under the Labor Party legislation since 1983. The last indexation, which took place in August of this year, was 0.6c. Why? Because under this government we were not running an eight per cent per annum inflation rate. When the Labor Party were running an eight per cent inflation rate and indexing by eight per cent per annum they never found that enough. So they went out and voluntarily and discretionarily legislated to index that.That is how you get the explanation as to how, when the Labor Party came to office, the petrol excise was 6.155c per litre and by 1996 the cheating on the import parity pricing, the full indexation and the discretionary indexing had taken it to 34.183c per litre. The Labor Party never showed any interest in petrol when they were in office - this is all a complete invention - and they did not run for the last election with a policy on indexation. We went to the new tax system with this same policy. The public is now getting benefits with increased growth, and that is what you get from better economic management.</DOC>

 - Last week the government announced nearly 250 new Work for the Dole projects providing work experience for nearly 5,000 additional participants, including four projects for 62 participants in the electorate of La Trobe. This brings the total number of Work for the Dole projects to well over 4,000 for some 105,000 participants. I am pleased to say that 36 per cent of Work for the Dole participants are in employment or education and training three months after leaving the program.This year the government introduced more flexibility into the program whereby participants could be reassigned, if necessary, to meet urgent community needs. I am pleased to say that last week 20 Work for the Dole participants in Narrabri and Lightning Ridge began helping with sandbagging and other emergency work. In addition, 37 participants in Gunnedah and Tamworth are helping this week with clean-up operations. This is the kind of thing which happens when you ask what people can do rather than what people cannot do and is why Work for the Dole has become one of the signature programs of the Howard government. I am sure every member of this House would want to salute each and every one of those participants for demonstrating that great Australian instinct to have a go.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen the letter of course - in fact I have a copy of it here. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition went out to Walgett in my electorate yesterday. It is my hope to go there later this week when the flood peaks hit - because it takes several days for the flood waters to get out there. But I just make this comment: had he cared to ask any of those people out there whether they were going to stop using their roads because of fuel prices they would have said, `No, we won't - we can't. We still have to educate the children; we still have to run our businesses; and we still have to go to the doctor' or whatever. The important point to be understood there is that better roads save wear and tear and fuel in very serious proportions. I have a neighbour in my part of the world who tells me he blows four tyres a year taking his kids to the school bus. Those tyres are worth about $200 a throw. A serious upgrade of his local road is going to make a big difference to his cost structure there. But I have seen the letter. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised - and I was surprised - to discover that the chairman of that particular branch, which I might add was the first branch after my own to renominate me for the National Party for the seat of Gwydir at the next election, had written to me. I quote from that letter, in part, as follows:The letter sent to Mr Beazley was meant to inform him of how tough things are in the bush. In my opinion the Australian Labor Party have never understood the impact of high prices on the bush, and have cared very little for the concerns of country people. When the Labor Party were last in government I recall the amount of excise on fuel going up by about 500 per cent. Thankfully we have a coalition government. I cannot start to imagine how much tougher things would be for people in the bush if the Labor Party were still in government. Their record damaged us badly, not only on fuel but on high interest rates, for many years. I know that the National Party and you, as our federal member, have fought hard to help reduce fuel excise.Mr Beazley forgot to mention that - a $2.2 billion reduction in fuel excise of overwhelming benefit to people in rural and regional Australia. He forgot to mention that in his gracelessness. The letter goes on to say - I think quite opportunely - I am looking forward to hearing what Narrabri's share of the finances will be when you and the Prime Minister announce the local roads package later today. Thank you for the strong representation you continue to give the electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. One of the surest indications that the government's funding bill for schools is a very fair and equitable piece of legislation is the very strong support it has from all Australian religious groupings and indeed from Australia's major ethnic communities. I previously informed the House about the support for the bill from the major churches in Australia, and members may be interested to know that in the past week the Most Reverend Harry Goodhew, Primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has written to the Prime Minister restating his and his church's support for the government school funding package. I quote:Acting on behalf of the Anglican Church of Australia, I previously joined other church and school leaders in signing a joint letter calling for the speedy passage of the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. I confirm my ongoing support for the early passage of this legislation.But this is not good enough for the opposition; for their own pathetic reasons, they want to drag out the passage of this bill for as long as possible. They see the non-government sector as if it were a collection of wealthy schools when in fact the non-government sector is comprised of schools serving some of the lowest socioeconomic level communities in Australia.Last Thursday the Prime Minister officially opened Al-Faisal College in Auburn, Western Sydney, a school with a legitimate enrolment of 341 students. The Leader of the Opposition will be pleased to know that there is no rorting of these enrolments, there are no dodgy deals here; these are genuine students from a needy community. This is one non-government school that the opposition does not want to talk about. As reported in last Friday's Sydney Morning Herald, the President of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Mr Abbas Ahmed, said the college, which will receive $1.1 million in Commonwealth funding in 2001, could not have been set up without the Prime Minister. Mr Ahmed went on to say: The Prime Minister's policy on education is so just and so fair that we would not have been able to do this without it.That sums up the attitude of communities around Australia. Whether they are Aboriginal community schools, whether they are Anglican schools - particularly low fee schools - whether they are Islamic schools or whether they are Jewish schools, all want this legislation passed because they recognise it as fair. The opposition should cease its obstruction of this legislation in the Senate and get on with providing Australia's schools with $22 billion over the next four years.</DOC>

 - If the member for Paterson wishes to send me Mr Mazaraki's letter I will be very happy to give him a prompt and courteous reply. In that prompt and courteous reply I will express my concern that over the last 18 months the price of crude oil has trebled, and that that is the reason high petrol prices are imposing an unhappy burden on many sections of the Australian community. In the course of replying to Mr Mazaraki I will also point out to him that, as a result of the announcement I made today about road funding, the ratepayers of the Port Stephens shire council -  - Great Lakes; well, Port Stephens does well, too. In fact, they all do well. I will point out with the same degree of politeness and courtesy to Mr Mazaraki that as a result of this the financial position of councils will be much stronger. They will have to spend this extra money on roads, but the fact that they have extra money to spend on roads means that there will be less pressure on other areas of the budget, including the provision of many charitable and welfare services. As a result, it is a good deal all round. So I suggest you get Mr Mazaraki's letter around to me as soon as possible, and he will get a prompt and courteous reply with great enthusiasm from me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and recognise his interests in improving the export opportunities for members of his constituency on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The Prime Minister's announcement on 15 November that Australia will be negotiating a free trade agreement with Singapore is tangible evidence of the government's commitment to advancing Australia's trading interests. We are prepared to take every opportunity to open up new markets for Australia's exporters, whether that be through bilateral relationships, regional relationships or multilateral relationships. This agreement will strengthen an already important economic relationship, with two-way trade between Australia and Singapore currently standing at $12.5 billion. The negotiations agreed to between our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Singapore are expected to commence early in 2001 and conclude within a 12-month period. We are particularly interested in improving market access in areas such as legal and financial services and telecommunications. During the process of the negotiations we will be consulting broadly with Australian business and other interested parties in this particular market.Today, I would also like to announce that we are going to appoint Mr Don Kenyon as Australia's lead negotiator in the Singapore FTA. Don Kenyon is an experienced trade negotiator, former WTO ambassador and, most recently, was posted in Brussels as ambassador to the EU. This FTA with Singapore is an important step for Australia and it is interesting to know that it is only the second Australia has participated in. The other very successful FTA we were involved in was with New Zealand. The closer economic relationship with New Zealand was started some 17 years ago when trade between New Zealand and Australia was standing at, I think, about $1.7 billion. Today, it stands at about $14 billion. It is interesting to note that it was also a coalition government that instigated that negotiation all those years ago. So, unlike the Labor Party, our government is prepared to be pragmatic and take every opportunity to expand market access opportunities for our exporters, whether it be in the multilateral scene or in bilateral negotiations like this one that we are embarking upon with Singapore. Again, the Labor Party has been left cheering in the grandstand on this issue. We have seen a lot of rhetoric from the shadow spokesman on trade for the Labor Party about what we should and should not be doing. History has recorded that during 13 years in office it did nothing in this regard. The last FTA we negotiated was instigated by a coalition government. This FTA negotiation was again instigated by a coalition government. The Labor Party, in 13 years, did nothing to pursue this agenda.</DOC>

 - One of the reasons that I did not seek to put before the parliament yesterday specific information about when information was brought to my attention was that I suspected that the honourable member might have something that I do not have, and that is in fact a letter from a lady called Mary Lindsay. My office has searched comprehensively to find such a letter, because there has been some scuttlebutt around that there may have been such a letter addressed to me. There is no record of it having been received in my office. I have not seen the letter. I would welcome the member for Bowman tabling it, because I would then be able to look at what it is he actually has.In relation to the specific matters, the fact is that in August or at the end of July I was briefed on the fact that certain allegations had been made and that they were being investigated by the police and by the South Australian Department of Human Services. The first time I had any correspondence on the matter was the letter that was addressed to me and copied to the Leader of the Opposition to which I referred yesterday. The point I make is that there has been a thorough search of all the correspondence sent to me. The first time any of the people who are raising these sorts of matters wrote to me was in October - a letter which was copied to the Leader of the Opposition. I was briefed earlier by my department. They prepared what you would know as a `possible parliamentary question', which never came but which dealt with this issue. My review of the situation at that time was that my officers had responded appropriately and that the relevant authorities that have the expertise to investigate these matters were doing so, those matters having been properly referred to them in some instances and the subject of individual complaints in others. - Yes. I would like to see the letter that, it is alleged, has been sent to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for that question. It gives me an opportunity to welcome very warmly on behalf of the Australian government the announcement made today by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, with the backing of DaimlerChrysler, that it will inject $172 million into its Australian operation. This is very good news for the motor industry in Australia, it is very good news for South Australia and it is very good news for the workers employed by the company in South Australia. It does demonstrate that the company is serious about the future of Mitsubishi Australia and it represents a vote of confidence in the company's Australian operation. I hope that this decision will boost the morale of Mitsubishi employees, particularly on the eve of Christmas. As honourable members on both sides of the House know, the motor manufacturing industry is quite fundamental to the South Australian economy, and any injection of funds of this magnitude in the motor industry in South Australia is extremely good news for the people of Adelaide and the people of South Australia. I am very confident that the government can assist the company as it explores new export opportunities to the United States and the Middle East and takes advantage of the favourable exchange rate to increase its competitiveness in the export market. In the coming months, the federal government will continue to liaise closely with the company officials and ensure Mitsubishi Australia have a clear understanding of how assistance packages, in particular the new $2 billion Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, can assist them. I take the opportunity of pointing out that the government's five-year freeze on automotive tariffs provides the opportunity for the industry to consolidate the improvements it has already made in recent years to its competitiveness. Our tax reform package is enormously beneficial to the motor car industry. It has no doubt been one of the elements that have encouraged the very significant and beneficial decision announced this morning.This news adds to a number of very positive developments over and above the generic strength of the Australian economy - a number of developments that have helped the South Australian economy. The spectacular success of the Australian wine industry of course delivers enormous benefits to South Australia. The Darwin to Alice Springs railway at long last is going ahead - first promised in 1911. It is going to provide 18 months work for the employees of the steel industry in the city of Whyalla. The road funding announcement that the Deputy Prime Minister and I made yesterday has been very warmly welcomed in South Australia. There will not be any people sending the money back from South Australia. The pork will not be sent back from Whyalla, Port Pirie or, indeed, from any part of Adelaide. I understand that Labor members representing electorates in South Australia have been busy, as they should be, on the phone to their local councils, encouraging them to take advantage of the government's injection of a very significant additional amount of money into the South Australian economy. This is a very good news day for the South Australian economy, it is very good news for the motor vehicle industry and it is another illustration of the great confidence of major long-term investors in the economic future of our country.</DOC>

 - It is the case that the document is what is known as an incident report. Departmental officers found it last Friday week on the file in Woomera, and it was on the Monday following that it was brought to the attention of the South Australian department and, as I said yesterday, was thought to be relevant. For that reason I initiated the inquiry in relation to procedures because, to my way of thinking, it is a serious matter if a document that might be relevant to an inquiry that has already been undertaken by Family and Youth Services was not available to them at the time. I do not know in whose hands it was. It may have been in the department's; it may have been in the hands of the contractors. But they are the matters that I believe are appropriate for Mr Flood to examine in his investigation. Can I seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to comment in relation to the earlier question that was put to me. - The letter which it is said was addressed to me is addressed to Mr Smith. I am not going to comment further on the letter, save to say that there have been some suggestions that it has been around for some time. Mr Smith is, I believe, Mr Glenn Smith, the State Director of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in South Australia. While it is not signed, he wrote a memorandum on 15 September to the parliamentary liaison section: Reference Mary Lindsay.I refer to correspondence to the minister on 11 September concerning Mary Lindsay. I can recall having a conversation with Miss Lindsay around that period outlined in the letter. Mary discussed with me the fact that she had been contacted by the Australian newspaper concerning the situation in Woomera or issues pertaining to TPVs generally. I recall that it was perhaps both topics. I also recall Miss Lindsay having worked as an IAAAS provider to a legal firm and that she had discontinued her services or the relationship had been ceased. No particular action arose from the discussion, as I was not in the position to offer direction to a private migration agent. I have no record of having received a fax from Miss Lindsay on the date outlined.He goes on to say:Unfortunately my then executive assistant no longer works with DIMA and I cannot confirm the events of the period or whether the letter was received. My diary shows that for the period 19/4 to 26/4 I was in Woomera. I do recall leaving for Woomera in a rather hurried circumstance at short notice. I was required to cover Woomera for the Easter-Anzac Day period. During that time, a faxed letter might have been mislaid.He says:I have no comment to offer as to how a letter faxed to me in April would subsequently relate to events that occurred in June.Further, as I said, these matters have been the subject of some suggestion by the media that they have also received this correspondence. My media adviser wrote me a memorandum relating to this letter:Minister, Mary Lindsay claims to have sent a letter to this office dated 18 April 2000 addressed to me. She is apparently claiming she mentioned allegations of child abuse in Woomera in the letter. I have no recollection of receiving a letter from Mary Lindsay. I do have a recollection of a phone conversation with Mary Lindsay on that date. My diary note of that conversation is attached. At no stage during that conversation did she raise issues of child abuse. The topic of conversation was her complaints against the law firm that she had been working for and the difficulties detainees were having in contacting their families by mail and phone.Steve Ingram, my media adviser, wrote that on 27 November.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. The Australian Taxation Office has been expecting between 1.6 and 1.7 million quarterly lodgements of the business activity statement. To date, there have been 1.5 million business activity statements lodged, which is a very high return given the fact that if you are lodging through an agent the time has not yet expired, provided the agent lodged 50 per cent by the due date on 11 November. More than that, around half of these 1.5 million lodgements came direct from business and not from tax agents, which again is a very high number. There was a Yellow Pages Small Business Index released today which asked a number of questions concerning the GST and the new tax system. It asked this question in November, interestingly enough, when the first quarterly returns were due: How easy have you found the implementation of the GST overall?And a majority - that is, 54 per cent - reported that they had found it either `very easy' or `quite easy'. Twenty-nine per cent reported a little difficulty, but those who reported it as very difficult were a very low 13 per cent. In the same release today when small business was asked about its prime concerns, it cited the GST as the fifth in order compared with May 2000 when it was at No. 1.None of that is to say that moving to a new tax system does not involve adjustment and dislocation. Obviously it does. I pay tribute to the small business community of Australia for the magnificent work it has done in adjusting to the new taxation system. Obviously this has involved considerable amounts of work as a consequence. The government is very mindful of that, and as a consequence of that has been making available as much assistance as possible, including $150 million in assistance specifically to train small business, charities and other small organisations. We still have operating the Australian Taxation Office help line and the tax agent call centre, and I would urge those businesses still to remit to get in touch with those organisations. There will be a lot of adjustment; we have always said that. As you bring the Australian taxation system out of a 1930s model and make it a 21st century taxation system obviously there will be a great deal of adjustment. Obviously, the task was not made easier by the obstructionist tactics of the Labor Party. But we can report that significant progress is now being made and that with the goodwill and assistance of small business we are well on the road to implementing the new taxation system which will be good for Australia, which will be good for jobs, which will secure a revenue base for our social services in the future and which will be consistent with the kind of modern economy that Australia wants.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question, which is the third in similar terms on this subject. I can assure the House that the Australian Federal Police have not downgraded their commitment to investigating allegations of paedophilia. The AFP office in Melbourne has integrated its paedophile investigations with other teams, and this approach, as I said on two previous occasions, has been used throughout the AFP to manage its work program. It allows the AFP to dedicate maximum resources to priority investigations.I am advised that the Operation Morocco files have not been archived. I am advised that during the reference about 250 matters were registered as the subject of inquiry. I am advised that the files are currently being prioritised and prepared for referral. Some of the matters will, as is the case with many complaints or allegations made to police, require no further investigation, because there is no substantiated allegation or matter that could warrant continuing investigations. I am told that many other matters resulted in subjects being placed on Travel Alert. The AFP has retained all of these files on Travel Alert, pending further assessment. In other cases, the AFP is seeking the assistance of international law enforcement agencies in relation to specific allegations against subjects. This conforms with AFP standard practice and its responses in respect of all matters referred to it. Matters are assessed under the case categorisation and prioritisation model. With that answer, I think the member for Denison and the member for Barton can be assured that the AFP is treating paedophilia investigations as seriously as it ever has.</DOC>

 - So knocked out are we by the reaction to the roads package that I am able to record some extraordinarily positive comments from people around the country in the House here today. I think those positive responses reflect very well the wisdom of the policy decision that we have made and the value of investing in the nation's infrastructure. One that comes to mind is from the Australian Food and Grocery Council. They said that this:... will stimulate productivity, growth, investment, employment and profitability in the processed food industry.The processed food industry just happens to be a major employer in Australia's manufacturing industries; so I would have thought that was a pretty desirable outcome. The Australian Trucking Association said - and it is very interesting; the Treasurer will like this:The tax reform process saw the Howard government reduce transport costs for the benefit of all Australians.They went on to say:The infrastructure announcement is the next step in keeping Australian businesses viable in an increasingly difficult global market.We are a major exporter, and that is where a lot of our economic growth is coming from, and where a lot of our jobs are coming from. I do not know whether anybody opposite has noticed that, but that is a matter of record. Anything we can do to improve our international competitiveness helps Australians with jobs.I met with the Australian Local Government Association yesterday. They told me that the Roads to Recovery Program goes a very long way indeed to meeting the very real needs that they have identified. Even the Municipal Association of Victoria recognised that the funding would `double Victoria's local repair budget'. Now where might that repair budget essentially come from? Us. It is not as if the Victorian Labor government is doing anything about it. While we are putting in an extra $250 million, Mr Bracks, who was out there complaining this morning about what we have done to Victoria, is going to put in $14 million - while we put in an additional $250 million. The managing director of Abbey Group Contractors said:No matter which way it is dissected, additional spending on infrastructure creates employment and it is there for future generations.The National Farmers Federation president said it was:an important boost that would prevent injury and death by restoring country roads.I could go on. A very useful contribution from Victoria was from Councillor Matheson, speaking again on behalf of the Municipal Association of Victoria. He said:These are the roads we use to get our kids to school, that get us to the local shops, are critical in getting produce from a farm or place of manufacture to the highway network and the market. These are important roads to maintain, both in safety terms and for our economic prosperity.They are very lucky in Victoria that they have a sympathetic federal government; they certainly have not got a sympathetic government at state level.  -  - Are they offering to give it back? We will run it down: I see. The comments from the aforesaid observers, commentators and industry groups are very welcome. But what is even better is the feedback from local councils themselves. I noticed that in New England the general manager of the Parry Shire Council has said that this is going to make `an incredible difference'. We have had a number of other councils, one saying they are rapt with the extra money, which they say will help their region's roads and bridges to `properly support the transportation of agricultural produce from outlying Wimmera farms' - another one from Victoria. But this one is my favourite. I received a letter today from the Mayor of Gloucester Shire Council in the electorate of Paterson. The member for Paterson, of course, yesterday was saying that this was trivial and unnecessary - in a different form of words, but that is what he was saying - or at least he was in here, before he scuttled out to talk to his local councils, and they have been responding today. The letter reads, in part:Dear Mr Anderson,On behalf of the Gloucester Shire Council I wish to convey our appreciation for the provision of additional funds for local roads. For many years, funding to bring local roads up to a satisfactory standard has been an issue for local government. You government's recent announcement will be welcomed by councils throughout Australia. At last - `At last', he says - somebody understands.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. The news about the additional funding for local roads has certainly been well received by farmers and by all of those people who live in rural and regional Australia. They have been appalled by the opposition's treatment of this issue. They have learnt a lot about what they can expect from Labor if ever they get back to government. This sort of issue, providing basic communications from the farm to the local community, is regarded as trivial and unimportant by the opposition. Labor have given a very clear signal to country people about what they can expect in relation to road funding if ever they were to come to office again. That signal is reinforced by the appalling performance of Labor state governments around the country in their contributions to road funding. As the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out just a few moments ago, they are `do nothing' people when it comes to country roads. According to Labor, the issue is trivial and unimportant. But it is not trivial and unimportant according to the rural sector.  A very large proportion of Australia's farm produce has to travel along local roads before it reaches the highway system for transport to ports for overseas exports and the like. These local roads are an essential element of the lifeblood, the basic transport system, of country Australia. So much of our farm produce is restricted on occasions from being able to get to market because of wet weather or alternatively because it is slowed down by inefficient and ineffective local roads. There has been a demand for something to be done about this for a long time. It is not surprising, therefore, that organisations like the National Farmers Federation have been delighted with this announcement. I quote briefly from a statement issued by the President of the NFF, Ian Donges:Too often, travelling on roads in the bush is a dangerous but essential activity for country people, who often have to travel huge distances for business and family reasons.Anyone who has been forced to travel along a slippery dirt road after rain understands that appropriate funding is a matter of preventing injury and death on our roads.Improved roads in the bush will provide a boost to economic efficiency and improve farmers' competitiveness.That is what the NFF thinks. Labor thinks the issue is trivial and unimportant but, for rural people, it is an essential boost to their communications networks. Let me say, as a former council chairman, that I can understand what this means for local government, which is always struggling to find sufficient money to meet the demands of ratepayers to upgrade local roads. Labor thinks that sort of thing is trivial and unimportant or, even worse, suggests that money that is spent in a rural area is somehow or other pork-barrelling for the National Party. If the money goes on stadiums and fireworks in the city, that does not matter but, the moment it is spent in the country, that is something that is unacceptable, trivial and unimportant. It is pretty obvious where Labor's priorities are. Labor votes against our reductions in fuel excise. It is opposed to our reductions in fuel taxes and now it will not spend money on roads either. This issue is trivial and unimportant to Labor but vital and essential to people who live in country communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. The contract is between my department and Australian Correctional Services Pty Ltd, on behalf of the Commonwealth. The agreement was dated 27 February. I am more than happy to table a copy of a document that has, in fact, been available for some time and can be accessed through the Internet, which outlines the provisions, including the arrangements for additional points for meeting and exceeding detention standards, as well as demerit points for failure to do so. The point I would make about these matters is that it is outlined in the contract. The contract is a matter that the department administers, and it is supervised, as are other contracts, by the Auditor-General. There is a legal obligation to -  -  - No, I do not micromanage their obligations in relation to those matters -  - And I would expect that, as we have seen in relation to other contracts to which the Commonwealth is a party, if there were any deficiency in relation to it, it would have been raised by the Auditor-General, in which case I would have followed those matters up. But I make the point that I do not sit down and examine the operation of every contract that my department -  - No, I will not, because -  - The only reason I would look at those matters is if there were some evidence of some deficiency in the way in which the department was dealing with them. There is no evidence of that. And, for the information of honourable members who cannot get it off the Internet, I table a copy of the detention agreement, with the commercial-in-confidence provisions deleted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have, as a matter of fact, had quite a few delegations from the member's seat talking to me about local roads. As I have already indicated in this place, there has been an overwhelmingly positive response out on the ground to the initiative that the Prime Minister and I announced yesterday. Indeed, one paper reported this morning that local governments have not had such a good deal since the days of Whitlam, so there you go! -  - Holt? There you go. When I attended the local roads congress in Moree earlier this year -  - one of the unanimously expressed views there was that additional funding for local roads ought to be provided by all levels of government across Australia. That view is shared by the Australian Local Government Association. It was agreed at that Moree conference on local roads earlier this year that all levels of government ought to participate in boosting funding for roads. We have increased our contribution by $1.2 billion, and the question is rightly asked: what has been the response of the state governments? I am sorry to say the only response you can point to is that they are all running for cover. I have mentioned that, in the case of Victoria, Mr Bracks unbelievably says that the federal government's increased expenditure of $250 million, on top of the $83 million we already provide annually, is `not enough'. That is what he said. As I said a moment ago, when you contrast that with the fact that he is putting in just $14 million over the period of time that we will be putting in $250 million, it really does highlight the shallowness of his response.His transport minister, Mr Batchelor, has abdicated all responsibility for local roads. He has responded by saying that `local councils are responsible for local roads'. Victorians ought to be aware lest Mr Batchelor is preparing them for the withdrawal even of the $14 million that he has put in. What he says is that it is not their responsibility - it is over to local government. Mr Batchelor in Victoria might be interested in the comments from the Victorian Farmers Federation. Peter Walsh, the President of the Victorian Farmers Federation, says two things. Firstly, he says that the VFF endorses the call for the Victorian government to increase its allocation to rural local roads. But, embarrassingly, he also points out that the Labor Party in Victoria made an undertaking prior to the last election to commit resources to local roads but that that commitment has not been met.  In Queensland, embattled Premier Beattie and Minister Bredhauer - they have been preoccupied, I suppose - have rejected the federal government's call to match additional funding or even to contemplate increasing their miserable five per cent contribution to local roads. They say they have no revenue source to match the program. I guess they are busy with other things.Coming to the member's specific question - New South Wales - the response of the New South Wales minister when asked to provide some more funding in response to this was that it was a bit rich. But he has said that he does want to help. He wants to assist in the selection process. He did not say it was trivial or unnecessary or that we should not do it, but he did sort of say that he would like the smell of frying bacon around the place. That is what he said. All I can do is take this opportunity to warn local councils of wolves in sheep's clothing. We can only assume that these state governments are toeing the ALP line on local roads. What are in fact boons for local councils remain boondoggles in the eyes of the ALP.</DOC>

 - I made it very clear that the inquiry will look specifically at the procedures that relate to the reporting of matters related to children to ensure that procedures are in place to properly address incidents if they occur and to ensure that they are fully and properly investigated. As I made clear yesterday, a minister is not the appropriate person to investigate issues in relation to allegations, particularly where they relate to children. The authorities that have that responsibility are Family and Youth Services in South Australia and the South Australia Police. They have the experience, the expertise and are the appropriate authorities to which allegations should be referred.As I mentioned yesterday, these allegations we are hearing seem invariably to come from individuals who have a mandatory obligation to report matters involving child abuse to the relevant authorities. One would ask the question: why would they be seeking a wider inquiry to investigate those matters by somebody who would not be expert? And why would they not take their complaints to the appropriate authorities for those matters to be addressed? I think there is another agenda and I hope that you are not pursuing it. I think that agenda is to unwind a policy that you in government implemented and operated. The agenda is in fact to dismantle the arrangements for contracted services in relation to detention. Is that the agenda? - I am not going to let that comment pass. I am very concerned about any allegations involving abuse of children. It is one of the reasons I have been conscientious about dealing with these issues and ensuring that they are referred to the appropriate authorities - not only that but also looking at the systems in place to see whether there are any deficiencies in those reporting obligations. It seems that the only people around here who have made the admissions today are those who have admitted that they have another agenda in raising these issues. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson, a hardworking neighbour who is very concerned about putting people into employment. That is what this government is committed to and that is why we have created 860,000 new jobs since the Howard-Anderson government came to power four years ago. It is the reason why unemployment now is the lowest it has been for decades - 6.3 per cent, which is substantially lower than when the Australian Labor Party were in government. One thing that is interesting is the continual rhetoric coming out of the Labor Party and some welfare agencies about the policy of breaching. The facts are that the ALP's breaching system was much harsher than our current regime. Why was that? It was because it was `one strike and you're out', and unemployed people could lose payment not just for a couple of weeks but for up to three to six months. There was no gradual reduction. The interesting thing is that it was welfare agencies that supported - and, indeed, supported by the Australian Labor Party when it went through the Senate - the current regime of breaching. It was supported by Labor. And why shouldn't we have a comprehensive system? We are telling those people who receive Newstart allowance that we expect them to comply - to report when they have changes in earnings, to turn up if they have an interview and to turn up to seminars. It is all part of the mutual obligation.The fact is that the majority of Newstart and Youth Allowance participants do the right thing: 86 per cent of the 1.3 million Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients in the last financial year did the right thing. There is a process of review: whether it is through Centrelink, through the Social Security Tribunal or through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the system is a lot fairer than it was when Labor was in government. What is Labor's record? When the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment, unemployment was at 11.2 per cent - over one million Australians were out of work. Working Nation was an absolute failure. Three out of five people who went through Working Nation remained unemployed, and is it any wonder that the old Department of Social Security were a lot more concerned about breaching people, because, when they did impose a breach, people lost their total payments straightaway; there was no gradual reduction such as we have introduced.Labor have been misrepresenting statistics and have been cooking the books for quite some time on these issues. I did note, though, that the Leader of the Opposition visited the Mandurah Centrelink office last Friday. I think it is terrific that the Leader of the Opposition is spending some time evaluating Centrelink and seeing the good work that the staff are doing - unlike his shadow minister. And it is interesting because, if when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment he had wanted to visit a Social Security office on a Wednesday afternoon - well, he could not have, because they were shut - he could not have made an appointment, because they would not take appointments; he would have had to queue, because that was their policy. The real concern here about breaches - Labor are not concerned about the breaches of those receiving Newstart or Youth Allowance - is the breaches of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the breaches that are going on, particularly about brown paper bags - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of his interest in the location of a machine at Orange, as he has made representation to me on it; but, to be fair, so have a lot of other MPs. To make sure the process is completely open and fair, I have asked Professor Blandford to chair a monitoring and evaluation group. That group also has on it Dick Scotton, a health economist from Monash University; a representative from my department; a state and territory representative; someone from the Health Insurance Commission, and a consumer.We will fund up to seven additional machines. We expect most of them to be located in rural and regional Australia. Professor Blandford's committee will oversee the exact tender process, because that is what his committee recommended. They are meeting for the first time on Monday week. If they can agree on a tender process at that meeting - and I would certainly hope they could - we would be advertising before Christmas for the tenders to go into place. While I cannot pre-empt what they are going to do, I have made two requests of them. The first is that facilities should be equally available to the public sector and the private sector, or the two sectors operating together. And the second, at the urging of the Minister for Finance and Administration, is the possibility of relocating an existing eligible machine into a public hospital facility. So I hope that we will have the advertisements before Christmas. Putting it at arm's length through a committee like this should give the people in Orange and other local members complete reassurance that we will have a system that is subject to considerable scrutiny and is robust, and I will be very pleased that this facility is much more widely available, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I am aware of such allegations because in the past fortnight the member for Lilley and the member for Dickson have repeatedly accused the government of having a quota system for breaching job seekers or for reducing their benefits. I have to say that it has been the slickest double act since the 1996 preference buying deal. - Let me make it very clear that no-one can be breached unless he or she unreasonably fails to attend a job interview or unreasonably fails to participate in an employment program. The number of breaches is not set by this government; it is determined by job seeker behaviour. Of course, the government expects that a majority of Job Network notifications will be actioned by Centrelink because it expects that Centrelink and Job Network will have a common understanding of what is reasonable. The government expects that most Centrelink breaches will be upheld, because it believes that they should not be imposed without due process and natural justice.This government is not interested in breaching people. What it is interested in doing is ensuring compliance with the rules. Let me say this: in areas where this government has responsibility it is absolutely determined to ensure that the law is obeyed - and you certainly cannot say that about the areas where the Leader of the Opposition has responsibility.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Lowe that I certainly do remember saying that. I said it last Saturday. Perhaps I also said it a day or so before when I made a comment about the obligation of the banks in the context of the floods in New South Wales. I hope that the collective response of the banks in relation to the difficulties in New South Wales will be positive, will be generous and will be understanding of the great difficulty that people now find themselves in. It is easy at a time like this for people, under the cover of the natural community sympathy for the farm sector, to make unreasonable demands on the banks. I think it is reasonable for somebody in my position in a very prominent, open way to ask the banks to chip in and help their fellow Australians in a time of distress. That is essentially what I have done. I do not believe, as your leader does, that the answer to this is to threaten regulation. I do not think regulation is the way to do it. The other matters you referred to were plainly not in the context of the remarks that I made. The remarks I made were in the context of the floods in New South Wales. The general question of the adequacy or otherwise of bank fees is, in my view, best dealt with by having a more competitive banking system. One of the things that this government has done has been to introduce greater competition. The changes that were made in the wake of the Wallis inquiry introduced more competition. Credit unions now have greater access to the payment system. The introduction of mortgage originators like Aussie Home Loans and RAMS have played a major role in providing more competition in home lending. All of those things are a result of the policies that this government has followed. I, along with other people, do not like it when bank fees are put up. But, in the long run, the best way of dealing with that is to have a more competitive banking sector rather than to go down the heavy-handed route of more regulation. So I repeat what I said in Gunnedah last Saturday: I want the banks to chip in and help their fellow Australians in a time of very significant difficulty. I indicated yesterday that the cabinet considered additional relief to the flood devastated areas of New South Wales. You have to remember - and I take the opportunity to emphasise this - that these farmers have lost three crops in a row. Some of them have lost two at the one time - a winter and a summer crop. For three years now many of them have been without any income at all and they do need some additional help. I hope it will be possible for the government to announce some additional help within the next day or so. My colleague the Deputy Prime Minister will be going to Walgett tomorrow. He will be absent from question time tomorrow because he will be visiting those areas of New South Wales that are still to experience the worst of the floods. Those remarks were made in the context of these floods being a particular disaster for a group of Australians. There is an obligation, under the broad principle of mutual obligation, for the banks to play a part. Mutual obligation is not limited to people in receipt of social security benefits. It is also, in my view, part of the fabric of this society that if companies enjoy good economic conditions and make good profits they ought to give something back to the community over and above the taxes they pay when economic circumstances allow them to do so. That is the context in which I made those remarks. I stand by them, and I think they are entirely appropriate. But I do not believe, as apparently your leader does, that the answer is to go a step further and threaten the banks with regulation. I think that is a mistake. I think it is totally counterproductive, and I am glad you are shaking your head to indicate that you agree with me. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The government believes very much in the importance of investment in education, and parents who want to invest in non- government schools should not be punished for their efforts. Under the government's legislation there will be strong incentives for parents to invest in non-government schools, and we believe also that governments have an obligation to provide capital funding for government schools and for needier non-government schools. The Leader of the Opposition has made it very clear that in his view any school that is able to raise millions of dollars for capital works - that is, money obtained from raffles, bingo nights, lamington drives, and by attracting donors to the school - does not deserve a fair go in recurrent funding. That is the Labor Party's view - that such a school does not deserve a fair go in recurrent funding. One of the arguments that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dobell have run during this entire campaign is: if a non-government school has access to millions of dollars, why on earth should it receive public funding? Yet they have very short memories, because a great deal of capital funding is provided to government schools. This year the Commonwealth government provided some $86 million in capital grants funding for non-government schools, but Commonwealth funding for capital grants to government schools this year totals more than $222 million. In other words, 72 per cent of all the capital moneys that flow from the Commonwealth, which in a number of states is more than half the total capital money going to schools, goes to government schools. We hear nothing from the Labor Party about the $3.2 million that the Howard government has given to Sydney Girls High School for the construction of art and music facilities, a library and the upgrade of applied science facilities. We hear not a squeak from the member for Dobell about the $3.1 million that the Howard government has provided to James Ruse Agricultural High School to construct a library, gymnasium and performance area. There is complete silence about the $3.1 million allocated to Toowoomba State High School to build art, music, woodwork, metalwork and kitchen facilities, and nothing at all about the $1.6 million we have provided to the mobile school for the children of travelling show people.This government believes in investing in education on a fair and equitable basis in the government and non-government sectors and it believes in encouraging that investment. All we have from the other side is intellectual and moral bankruptcy on the issue of funding education in this country. The Leader of the Opposition - the genius sitting over there - has conducted a campaign that has so far had the effect of losing him the support of the entire non-government sector and of laying a series of time bombs and booby traps in Labor marginal seats for the next election campaign. Finally - this is an example of the tremendous success of his campaign - he has whipped up a campaign within the Labor Party against himself as leader as a result of his misrepresentations. Earlier this month, the Labor mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley, dumped on the Leader of the Opposition from a great height when he said:Kim Beazley in my opinion has failed in his job. Let me say very clearly, in my view, the Labor Party and the leadership of the Labor Party in Canberra has failed. That is a result of the total collapse of the Leader of the Opposition's credibility. He has lost the support of the entire non- government sector and he has lost support in his party. The opposition should stop this pathetic posturing and pass the legislation so that parents and schools in this country can get the resources they need.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Chisholm for her question because we can now get the facts right. In fact, the complaint letter from the ANF was received by the department on 2 December and there was a response to it on 8 December 1999. It raised staffing issues, which had been dealt with in the Industrial Relations Commission earlier that year. However, I would like to quote some comments that were made by the Reverend Dr Robert Johnson concerning this home. He wrote to the Herald Sun saying that there had been quite a to-do about the fact that they had not passed 43 out of the 44 standards - which I remind the opposition were standards set by this government on 2 September 1999 and came into operation only this year. I will simply read from this letter, in which the Reverend Dr Robert Johnson says:But that is not how it is at that facility ...The Uniting Church Synod acted as soon as it became aware of the difficulties. Through a series of actions the Church has seen the Thames St facility achieve 43 out of 44 standards set by the Aged Care Standards Agency by last Friday (November 17). The church will spend about $500,000 in hiring new staff, implementing new safety and management procedures and upgrading beds and equipment. The Uniting Church took the rare step of requesting the board of management stand aside.The CEO was stood down, and after investigation was dismissed. A commissioner, Ms Imas Thompson, has been -   - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said, the new system of accreditation that this government has put in place required the Uniting Church to take the action that the Reverend Dr Robert Johnson writes about. I will read a little more from his letter. He continues: The Church seconded several top staff from its other aged-care agencies to implement the changes at Thames St. The bottom line is that the ANF's industrial relations complaint was received on 2 December and it was responded to on 8 December - which is what I said originally. There was a second -   - It is our system of accreditation that caused the subsequent visit to be undertaken, which found that things had to be put right. The Uniting Church has responded to this government's requirement as set out in the legislation and it is now moving to accreditation.  - I would be happy to; it is from a newspaper. - </DOC>

 - I appreciate the question because, from the government's point of view, one of our highest priorities is creating a climate in which more jobs can be created. We do not rest on our laurels, even though in the time that we have been in office something like 809,000 jobs have been created. Of course, we are a long way from the days when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment and we had over one million people unemployed and an unemployment rate at its highest since the Great Depression. - The recession that we had to have, in which he was principally involved. It is a very simple proposition but it is absolutely right: if you help small business, it will create jobs. That is good for the economy, it is good for people who are unemployed and it is definitely worth doing. That is why I am pleased to advise the House that we will again reintroduce our bill to provide an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal laws. This provision is specifically directed at providing a benefit to the small business community. We do so because small business is different to big business. If you are running a big business, you may have the lawyers, the company secretaries and the personnel departments; but, if you are running a small business and you have to defend yourself against one of these claims, to do so means that you have to close the doors of your business. For a small business, if you are unsuccessful and get a significant order against you, this means the difference between whether or not your business is viable or it is unviable. If it is unviable, it will not be just the proprietor who is burdened by that result but maybe the one other person who has a job in that business that is jeopardised as a result.Countries overseas have this provision. This provision is okay under international standards set out by the ILO. It is a very reasonable measure that Australia ought to have. I note in the recent survey of Australia from the OECD that they have a series of recommendations of changes that should be made. They refer specifically to the bill that we have had before the parliament before, and they recommend to `implement small business exclusions and consider more general reform of the legislation'. That is independent advice from a well-respected authority to the effect that, if this exemption went through the parliament, it would provide job opportunities for literally thousands of Australians. This government is committed to it.It is a fact that we have seen this measure obstructed on more occasions than probably any other measure that this government has put before the parliament. In fact, the Labor Party, I think, have now voted against it on eight occasions or thereabouts. Someone said to me, `Well, why would you put it up again?' There is a simple answer: this government is in favour of small business. On behalf of small business, we will not take no for an answer. This is a measure that is in everybody's interests.I call on the Leader of the Opposition to finally stand aside and allow the government to implement a mandate that we received at the last election. I remind him that, on education, he said last week, `Well, in the end, we're not going to vote against it, because we are not a Senate party.' How is it you are not a Senate party on education but when it comes to providing jobs in small business you do what the unions want you to do and you prevent small business giving somebody the chance of a job? I say that it is about time the Leader of the Opposition actually stood up to a few of his union mates, stood up for small business and gave people a chance of a job they ought to have. </DOC>

 - If the Leader of the Opposition would bother to read the Hansard of the estimates hearings when the statements to which he has referred were made, he would find that the departmental officer explained to him that that had been a standard clause that had been put into letters; it did not apply to this particular case. -  - If you find it so amusing, you obviously have no care for the residents after whom we look. The department explained that it was a clause that it had put in its correspondence at the time of the Riverside matter, when it was under stress, and it was using its resources. It explained that it in no way related to the matter of fact in this particular instance. It went on to say that it had acted appropriately, and if you look at the time line -  - Mr Speaker, if you read the rest of the Hansard record, you would see the time line which was followed which showed that the department acted appropriately in this case. When it was brought to the attention of the Uniting Church, they acted in accordance with the government's reforms, and in fact the home has now, as I have said, passed 43 of the 44 standards.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. The member for Corangamite has been a great advocate of the economic policies of this government that have created a very sound foundation for Australia's exporters who, for the 12 months to September of this year, have posted $134.5 billion worth of exports out of Australia - exports of goods and services. This is good news as far as Australia is concerned and good news for our economy, particularly for the jobs that are generated by Australia's exporters. A lot of the 800,000 new jobs that have been created during the life of this government have come from exporting industries.It is important that we as a government do recognise the efforts of Australia's exporters and, tomorrow morning, I will be hosting a breakfast with the finalists in this year's Australian Export Awards. This year, we have had 300 entries and, out of those, a record 67 national finalists. Last year's winner was Pipers Brook Vineyard from Tasmania, a participant in the record breaking Australian wine industry, which has exports worth around $1.3 billion. Another industry that is going extremely well at the moment in exports - and the news today from Mitsubishi is fabulous news - is the automotive industry which, in the last 12 months, has exported almost $4 billion worth of automobiles and parts out of Australia. The news today from Mitsubishi will further bolster and strengthen the Australian automotive export sector. We are seeing as finalists a lot of exporters from regional Australia, from areas such as Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Griffith in the seat of Riverina, Burnie in the seat of Braddon, Ballarat in the seat of Ballarat, Albury in the seat of Farrer, Warwick in the seat of Maranoa and Toowoomba in the seat of Groom. All those areas and all those exporters would welcome yesterday's announcement of the Roads to Recovery Program that is going to help bolster and improve the infrastructure in their areas and help make them more competitive.We all know that those exporters are concerned about some alleged alternative policies in Australia today that might threaten the strength of their competitive nature. We know that, although he is not here today, the shadow Treasurer keeps on talking about roll-back. We know the Leader of the Opposition does not utter the word `roll-back' anymore. Australia's exporters are quite concerned about any change to the new taxation system that has seen $3.5 billion worth of cost impediments lifted off their backs. A recent survey found that 90.5 per cent of businesses do not want the Labor Party's roll-back. I think the message may have got through to some but certainly not to the leadership. Australia's exporters deserve the recognition of all Australians for the effort they are putting in to inject much needed export income into our economy and to generate more jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I think the issues were dealt with fairly fully yesterday. If he did not hear me clearly, let me state in relation to those people who are making allegations that I have to exempt those who repeat allegations - and repeat them over and over and over again on radio programs - and then say that they do not want to be involved in making allegations. Nevertheless, the fact is that those individuals who suspect on reasonable grounds that a child has been or is being abused or neglected, and if that suspicion is formed in the course of the person's work, must notify the South Australian Family and Youth Services as soon as practicable after they form that suspicion. Abuse includes physical, emotional and sexual abuse or neglect of a child. Notification may trigger an investigation by FAYS, removal of a child if it is in danger or an application to the youth court for various orders. The persons who are required to report abuse include medical practitioners, pharmacists, registered and enrolled nurses, dentists, psychologists, members of the police force, social workers, teachers, government employees and employees of non-government bodies that are delivering a range of services, including caring services, which I think would relate to most of the people who seem to be making public comments now about matters which they knew about as long ago as March and April. The fact is that people have not only a moral but also a legal responsibility to report abuse. and they get protection in relation to those matters. The department have no obligation to inform others of the fact that a complaint has been made to them. The only way in which we have become aware of the limited number of cases where reports were made is because the people involved in making the reports told us they were making the reports, which does not suggest to me that people were in any way intimidated about meeting their legal obligation. The fact is that the police who have been involved in investigating some matters and Family and Youth Services are the authorities who have the expertise, the background and the knowledge to be able to undertake those inquiries and make appropriate judgments. Some people seem to think the answer is some wider form of inquiry which would allow a lot more people to make unsubstantiated allegations or to say that they have met somebody who told them that they know something, which is what we are hearing.  Let me make it very clear: we do take these issues very seriously. That is why the Flood inquiry is looking at one, I would say, probably minor defect in relation to a document that in the end may not turn out to be relevant in terms of reassessing the earlier assessment. I have instigated an inquiry to ensure that all of the procedures were full and complete. Let me also say that there have been circumstances in relation to another detention centre where there were investigations by another state department which have led to charges being brought which are presently before the court. So there is no lack of application on our part or the part of state authorities to ensure that children are properly protected. I do not see, in terms of any of the information that has been put to me, any reason to reassess the decision I have made about the way in which these issues should be dealt with.</DOC>

 - We will come back to you a bit later. I thank the member for Cook for his question. The member for Cook has shown a lot of interest in Korea, having visited South Korea in the course of this year. I think it is easy for members to think of the Korean Peninsula as being somewhat distant from Australia's immediate security needs, but it is important that the House understand that stability on the Korean Peninsula is crucial to stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, 40 per cent of Australia's exports go to North Asia and any deterioration in the security environment on the Korean Peninsula will have very serious consequences directly for Australia. Also, members do not need to be reminded that some 17,000 Australians served in the Korean War and around 200 were killed.I visited North Korea from 14 to 16 November so that Australia was at least able to make some contribution to the improving environment on the Korean Peninsula. During my discussions with North Korean leaders, I was encouraged that they did recognise the importance of North Korea's engaging more constructively with the international community. That is particularly so because of the state of the North Korean economy and the need to try to encourage both foreign investment and the building of their trade. Secondly, I was pleased to hear such positive commitments to reconciliation between the north and the south and, indeed, the North Koreans made it clear that they now support the reunification of the Korean Peninsula on the basis of a confederal system of government. Thirdly, the Koreans were prepared to talk very openly with me about the difficult medium and long range missile issues. They made it clear that they would end their long range missile program if other countries launched satellites on their behalf, and that they would give up their missile exports if they are adequately compensated - interestingly enough, making it clear that foreign exchange was their main interest.The humanitarian problems in North Korea are very severe, and I think it is important that we as a humane and prosperous country make a contribution to their resolution. While I was there I announced a further $5 million worth of funding to the World Food Program and some support for UNICEF as well. I witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on bilateral cooperation in agricultural research.  I do not think we should have any illusions about the regime in North Korea. This remains a regime which has no intention at this stage of pursuing political reform; nor does it seem very committed to economic reform. Nevertheless, it is a regime which is coming somewhat in from the cold, and it is important that a significant country like Australia is in the Asia-Pacific region makes a contribution to that process.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As he well knows, the government is very keen to ensure that there is a smooth transition from analog to digital broadcasting. We have supported an approach that not only minimises disruption to consumers but also provides the most rapid possible take-up of digital television, and a range of options for viewers in terms of price and equipment availability, including low cost entry products. It is the government's strong view that reasonably priced free-to-air set-top boxes must be available by or soon after 1 January to enable those consumers who want to move quickly into digital television to purchase the necessary equipment. It is also imperative that these boxes allow receipt of all free-to-air services, and broadcasters have agreed that this needs to be the case. The first generation receivers are expected to allow consumers to have access to wide-screen standard definition digital television, including program enhancements provided by free-to-air broadcasters and multichannel services provided by the ABC. As to any further particulars contained in the honourable member's question, I will refer them to the minister for communications and will reply further to the member if required.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can inform the House that the international trade in goods and services for the month of October showed a surplus of $324 million. In goods and services for the month of October we ran a current account surplus. It was the second surplus in a row - the last being in September which was, as I informed the House at the time, heavily influenced by the Olympics, in particular Olympic related exports. After having abstracted the effect of the Olympics from the September and October figures, the figures nonetheless show that we still ran a current account surplus for the month of October of around $164 million. Abstracting the Olympics from both the September and the October figures showed that exports grew by 6.8 per cent in October. In the year October on October, Australia's exports have grown 23.5 per cent. Non-rural and other goods exports increased 7.7 per cent in October and rural goods exports increased 5.7 per cent - the highest monthly level on record. This is consistent with the government's forecast for a narrowing current account deficit from an outcome of 5.3 per cent in the last financial year to 4¼ per cent in the current financial year. Last year Australia's exports grew by an average of nine per cent and the government forecast is that they will grow this year by nine per cent again. That is a nine per cent growth followed by another nine per cent growth off that growth. These are very strong growths in Australia's exports, leading the current account in the month of October into surplus. For the first time since the Asian financial crisis, exports will make a contribution to growth in Australia which we estimate will be around one per cent. I think all Australians would be pleased with the October trade figures, which are very strong figures and which are being led by a strong export performance which will be contributing to growth and jobs for Australians in the forthcoming year. </DOC>

 - The government have a very good record on this. Year after year we have acted to protect consumers' free-to-air service. The AFL broadcasting rights provisions, subject to the anti-siphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 - not that I would have expected the honourable member to have done that amount of research; nor the tactics committee that handed him this question - do not restrict the flexibility of free-to-air broadcasters and the AFL to determine appropriate levels of coverage in television markets across Australia. The AFL has indicated that it wishes to promote its competition and is motivated to ensure that it continues to receive a high level of public exposure through free-to-air coverage.The AFL is well placed to negotiate minimum levels of coverage directly with free-to-air broadcasters as a condition of assigning the broadcast rights. We are well aware from media reports that the current AFL broadcasting rights holder, the Seven Network, has complained to the ACCC that a bid from a rival consortium led by the Nine Network may be in breach of the Trade Practices Act competition provisions, and I understand that the ACCC is considering Channel 7's claims. The government would not wish to see the outcomes of these negotiations result in the diminution of the amount of AFL on free-to-air television. - I am glad the opposition found the answer comprehensive in detail - but they are confidential notes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Today's announcement of a trade surplus for the second month in a row is certainly one that all Australians, particularly Australia's exporters, should be proud of because it continues to show a very strong trend of growth with the increase in Australia's exports. The surplus of $324 million for October follows September's surplus of $677 million, which was obviously impacted upon by the Olympics. But, as the Treasurer indicated in the earlier question, even if you extract that, the trend is still very strong and still very positive. Given the economic circumstances within the region in the past, it is a very good outcome for Australia's exporters.In the last 12 months until October this year, Australia's exports topped $136.9 billion, which is a significant increase on the previous 12 months of $126 billion. Exports of goods have hit record monthly levels in both rural and non-rural sectors. Rural exports rose six per cent on the month to nearly $2.5 billion to be now running at 33 per cent higher than a year ago. Non-rural and other goods exports reached a record $7.9 billion in October, up 24 per cent on a year ago. As expected, services exports eased after the Olympics but remain strong and are significantly higher than pre-Olympic levels and 20 per cent higher than in October 1999. So the indicators are all very good, and again I say that Australia's exporters should be congratulated on the effort that they have put in and the way that they have worked with the government. The effort that has been put in in a number of different areas is underpinned by the sound economic management of the Australian economy that provides a very sound platform for Australia's exporters to work off and from which to launch into the international marketplace. We have made a number of reforms over the years that have made them more competitive in the international marketplace, and we continue to aggressively pursue better market access opportunities for Australia's exporters. Certainly they do not want to see some of the policies that have been proposed by the Australian Labor Party, particularly the roll-back of the $3.5 billion in taxes that we have taken off the backs of Australia's exporters. They are much better positioned to be more competitive in the international marketplace, and certainly as a government we are going to continue to encourage and facilitate Australia's exporters to continue that trend growth.</DOC>

Secondly, there was an informal discussion among health ministers that was not part of the meeting and, in that informal discussion, the Queensland health minister said that he had put in extra funds to address the problem. The states are welcome to fix this. Some states are working on it quite well because they are putting in the extra resources. In Victoria, they can spend some of Jeff Kennett's surplus if they want to fix it.  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The significant injection of capital into much-needed infrastructure in rural and regional Australia will of course benefit Australia's exporters - many of whom are located in rural and regional Australia. Exports out of Australia generate in excess of 1.7 million jobs. One in five Australian jobs relies on exports and one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. One of the most fundamental elements of exporting out of regional Australia is the infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure. This significant boost to that infrastructure across Australia has certainly been welcomed by Australia's export industries, particularly those located in rural and regional Australia. It will give them much more efficient access to airports, ports and terminals across Australia. The Australian Local Government Association points out that local roads:... are a vital link in the national export chain. Failure of the roads system means that agriculture, mining and timber products do not get to the rail head or the port on time or at all. The efficiency of rural roads has a direct impact on the competitiveness of Australian products in terms of cost and reliability of delivery to national and international markets. The adequacy of the rural roads system has a direct impact on the cost of inputs to primary producers, and subsequently affects their incomes and the wealth of the regions of the nation. The Commonwealth coalition government's Roads to Recovery Program will be of direct benefit to Australia's exporters. That has been recognised across Australia not only by the Australian Local Government Association but also by the Australian Food and Grocery Council. It said:Capable and competent infrastructure including roads is essential if Australia is to capitalise on the comparative advantage it has in agrifood exports and potential for sustained development and employment growth in rural and regional Australia.That is what we are about: providing balanced opportunities. Headlines that have been floating around rural and regional Australia following the announcement of the Roads to Recovery package include `Fast track roads in rural Australia', `Commuters big winners' and `Bring on the new bitumen'. The Australian Labor Party is standing in the way of this program. The Australian Labor Party would not address this issue in 13 years in government. It voted against opportunities to improve the infrastructure in Australia - whether it was significant arterial roads, local roads or rural roads. Our Roads to Recovery Program will significantly benefit Australia's exporters, particularly those in rural and regional Australia that are providing one in four jobs in that area. </DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, the complaint from the nurses union, the ANF, was received by the department on 2 December. They responded to that complaint on 8 December, and the complaint referred to material that had been dealt with by the Industrial Relations Commission earlier that year. It was an industrial dispute complaint. Subsequently, I explained to the honourable member that our whole accreditation system - which includes review audits; they are all set out in our Aged Care Act and are part of our reforms that were needed because of the state in which Labor had left the system -  -  - They were very much needed. The review audit and the nurses federation -  -  - I will be pleased to give opposition members the information. The review audit that took place in August related to two subsequent complaints that came in August about meals and staffing areas - they were anonymous complaints. The review audit was done and subsequently the site audit was done for accreditation. When the Uniting Church became aware of the state of the place, they reacted immediately. As I told you yesterday, they sacked the board, they sacked the CEO, they put in a new team and the hostel is now proceeding to accreditation, having passed 43 of the 44 standards. That is what I would call a satisfactory outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question, and I note her special interest in the subject of the question. The government - and I would particularly mention the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation - has been working particularly hard to restore certainty to the Corporations Law by the means of securing a referral of state powers. But at the joint meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Ministerial Council for Corporations held in Sydney last night, the Labor states derailed the process. - They attempted to force the Commonwealth into accepting a referral that would leave Australia with a system of corporate regulation just riddled with problems. Over the course of the negotiations, the Commonwealth and the states have reached agreement on a substantial range of issues. The Prime Minister, among others, has reassured the states that the Commonwealth will not be misusing any referred power. - However, it is clear that the process has now become bogged down by political point scoring by the states and by political rhetoric. What the Labor states are trying to do - and this is confirmed by the frontbench interjections here today - is create the impression that the referral of Corporations Law powers is designed to be used by the Commonwealth for industrial relations reform. This is a complete furphy. It is just mischief making - political mischief making. But it is not just the states that are doing it now. The member for Brisbane, who is making a lot of noise, has joined them. - He is perpetrating the same furphy. He is taking up the same scare campaign. The Commonwealth and the states do not need a three-page-long section inserted into the referral bill at the eleventh hour in order to guarantee that the Commonwealth cannot use referred power to regulate industrial relations. Such a provision would not give any greater protection than the arrangements that the majority of states had previously agreed to. But it can create great uncertainty and it can vastly increase the potential for legal challenges to the bill by those who would thwart its operation and by those who would seek to challenge the actions of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. These are real risks that the government takes seriously - even if the opposition does not.The provisions promoted by the states and now supported by federal Labor are a political play at best. The political play would prove a serious headache of the same sorts of dimensions as we are currently trying to rectify by obtaining an appropriate referral. Added to this, the states have promoted a further absurd proposal that we should allow individual states to unilaterally decide which amendments of the Corporations Law will or will not operate in their jurisdiction. The package offered by the states is unworkable; it is no solution. While the Commonwealth's door remains open to the states to engage in sensible discussion of a reasonable package, the government is going back to the drawing board to consider all options. Among those options, of course, is the possibility of national legislation, using the Commonwealth's existing powers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his interest in this matter. I am pleased to advise the House that Zurich Financial Services Group have announced the establishment of their capital markets Asian headquarters here in Australia. This is a strategic partnership with two Australian partners: Consolidated Press, which is associated with the Packer family, and Queensland Press, which is associated with the Murdoch family. Zurich is one of the world's largest financial institutions with offices in over 60 countries and nearly $1,000 million in funds under management. Of course, Zurich already has a significant presence in Australia in insurance and investment. However, the opening of their Asian Capital Market Centre here is an additional bonus. Of course, it is subject to the usual approval process, but it does supplement their other market activities. In relation to Zurich Financial Services Group's market activities, they already have major headquarters in New York, London and Dublin, and now they have their Asian headquarters here in Australia. Malcolm Jones, the chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region for Zurich, said:Sydney is a growing and significant financial centre, offers a pool of talent and opportunities that are second to none. I look forward to working with Zurich Capital Markets on their expansion in their banking and related activities.This has been followed by the announcement by Charles Schwab of a fifty-fifty joint venture with ecorp, an Australian based company, to set up here in Australia. They have announced that they will be providing a range of services, including full share trading services and access to their worldwide research, to their already existing 50,000 customers here in Australia. They are opening offices in Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney. They will be able to provide Australia's millions of shareholders with access to new products and services ranging across a wide range of banking and financial products that have not previously been offered in Australia. These are incremental steps. These are a step-by-step approach to how we are building a global financial centre. Each institution that comes to Australia is offering new products to Australian consumers. Perhaps even as important as that is the fact that they are now exporting services to the Asian region and to the rest of the world from here in Australia. The benefit for consumers continues. On 1 July next year we abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares, something the Labor Party opposed at every point. We are making share trading more affordable for the millions of Australians that are participating. We are making banking more affordable by abolishing financial institutions duty which the Labor Party opposed at every point. Australia continues to grow as a global financial centre, despite the best endeavours of the Labor Party to stop it.</DOC>

 - It sounds like Bob Ellis is back on the payroll, from that question.  -   - Firstly, the annual report is with the printer. Secondly, as to the Gray report, Professor Gray requested an extension of time because of his consultations taking longer. Thirdly, with regard to the national strategy for an ageing Australia - something which is beyond the comprehension of you lot, that's for sure - it is not something that is done in a five -  - Ageing but without wisdom. If I might say, the national strategy for an ageing Australia, which has had submissions from all over Australia, is not something you plan in five minutes when you are planning for 50 years. It is a serious endeavour which this government has undertaken. - It may come out after you are no longer leader. That would be possible. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.

 - I thank the member for Blair for this question, and I note that current Work for the Dole projects in his electorate include providing household services to people with disabilities, refurbishing farm machinery and restoring the local showground. These projects are very good for local communities, they are very good for participants and they would be worth doing even if no-one found a job out of them. In fact, participants in Work for the Dole are 50 per cent more likely to find work than participants in New Work Opportunities, which was the comparable program under the former government. Yesterday the member for Dickson, responding to misleading statements from ACOSS, issued a press release. She did not do live media lest she be asked the obvious question: how can you keep the so-and-sos honest when you are taking their money? - In her press release, the member for Dickson said that Work for the Dole was just about `getting people to mend fences and dig ditches'. Ben Chifley would be turning in his grave to hear an ALP frontbencher sneering in that way at manual labour. I have to say that the Work for the Dole participants in Dickson who are doing office work for local charities and sporting associations and who are building a community gymnasium in Lawnton would not be very happy either. The member for Dickson claims to support Work for the Dole, but she constantly ridicules every aspect of this program. She has no credibility - no credibility whatsoever. She has as much credibility as the Leader of the Opposition, who claims to be against electoral rorts but is constantly trying to protect the teacher's pet.</DOC>

 - Kenilworth Nursing Home is, as I understand it, still before the AAT, but I can tell you that there have been five sets of sanctions applied to it. The number of residents presently in that home is five. The advocacy group appointed in Victoria works with them regularly, as do nurses from our department. An application for accreditation has been received but, to my knowledge, the cheque has not been paid at this stage so it is not a valid application that can result in a site visit. The five sanctions remain in place and if, at 31 December, the home is not accredited then federal funding will totally cease. - I will answer that interjection, because it is important to know that the department has in place a strong contingency plan to deal with that small number of homes at risk that may need to be dealt with in terms of their having no further funding. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh, who I know has a very genuine interest in looking after older Australians. What is interesting is that over 1.9 million people now have received the aged persons savings bonus. Almost 60 per cent of Australians have received the full $1,000 and nearly 75 per cent of those older Australians have received $500 or more. Likewise, with the supplementary bonus, over 223,000 self-funded retirees have now received that bonus. A total of 67 per cent of self-funded retirees have received the full $2,000 and 77 per cent of self-funded retirees have received $1,500 or more. We estimate that 2.4 million people will qualify for a bonus, as originally forecast.The interesting thing is that, rather than the $672 that was originally estimated for the bonus, the average bonus now paid is $931. Of course the reason that we are paying this bonus is to help compensate older Australians, in terms of savings or investment income, for the introduction of the new tax system. It certainly was not compensation for buying preference deals. - Let us look at the record of what happened when Labor were in government. When they increased their own hidden tax, the wholesale sales tax - particularly in 1993, where they raised it from 10 to 12 per cent - was there compensation? No. When they raised it from 20 to 22 per cent was there compensation? No. When they raised it from 30 to the high 30s was there compensation? No. Was there compensation when they unilaterally increased fuel excise by 5c in 1993-94? No. Was there any compensation when they broke their promise to make tax cuts? No. They did not help older Australians at all.When the coalition got into power not only did we ensure that there was an up-front four per cent increase on pensions from 1 July but we also tied pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. If the Labor Party had been in government, pensioners would have been $13.60 worse off because pensions would not have been tied to male total average weekly earnings. Indeed, if you had followed the Labor Party's rationale, pensioners would have been $28 a fortnight worse off under Labor. Of course these older Australians receive most of their payments as traceable bank deposits, not as untraceable wads of money in brown paper bags. </DOC>

Since that time it has been brought up to standard and has now been accredited. With regard to the allegations made by the shadow minister, the concerns raised about those deaths were referred by the deputy secretary to my department to the Queensland police, who in turn referred them to the coroner. The coroner is of the view that he accepts the death certificates as they stand and any further investigation would be a matter for the Queensland government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson, who represents close to half the national sugar industry in her own electorate, and serves as chairman of the coalition's sugar industry task force. She, like other members representing sugar electorates, played a key role in the development of the federal government's response to the serious problems confronting our nation's sugar producers. They have been facing difficult times because of poor seasons -  droughts and floods - low sugar content, orange rust and low world prices. But this government responded with a very significant package of assistance for the industry, estimated at around $83 million, to provide support for up to $400 million worth of loans for the sugar industry. I am pleased to report to the House that there has been a very good response from industry to this package: 4,344 claims have now been granted for assistance under this particular scheme, and a number of other applications are under consideration. Some growers found that they were ineligible for the package because of the definition of `sugar farmer' or because their incomes were so low this year that a small amount of income from some other farming activity or even off-farm activity made them ineligible for the package. Those rules have now been relaxed to make it easier for those people who are genuine sugar producers to access the package. There have been 4,344 successful claims under the federal government's package.Honourable members are probably aware that the Queensland government have also provided a sugar industry package. They paraded around the state and boasted in front of the television cameras about the wonderful aid that they were going to provide to the industry. They said they were prepared to provide a total of $10 million to assist farmers. They sent applications out to every farmer in Queensland - twice to most farmers. Honourable members may be interested to know that the minister for primary industries in the Queensland parliament was asked a similar question to that asked by the honourable member for Dawson today, about the success of the Queensland government's assistance package for farmers. I thought honourable members of this House might be interested to contrast the number of applications for the federal government's package - 4,344 - with the number of applications for the Queensland government's package. Would honourable members like to guess how many there have been?  -  - No, sorry - 500 is far too high. - Five? As low as five? Even that is too high. - The total number of applications: three. The total number of successful applications: zero. There were not any. One has been refused and the other two are awaiting extra information. This is the Queensland government's response to the crisis in the sugar industry. It was always smoke and mirrors. It was an opportunity for the Premier to parade in front of the TV cameras. It was a stunt. There was no real assistance. It was just an opportunity for Premier Beattie to parade around and pretend he was interested in the problems. Industries know that if they want real assistance it is only a coalition government that will deliver. Labor delivers zero: zero benefit for the sugar growers, zero benefit for the sugar industry communities in Queensland and zero benefit for the nation.</DOC>

 - The honourable member does not quite have it right; I was not ringing around trying to find a bed for this person. The journalist rang my office on the Friday before the newspaper story appeared and said there had not been a single private hospital bed available in Melbourne. I thought this was patent nonsense, so I did actually get on the phone myself. I rang the Epworth and, on the night concerned, which was 2 November, there were 23 beds available in the Epworth. At Waverley Private Hospital, which normally takes the overflow from Knox, there were 15 empty beds on that night. At Cotham Private Hospital there were 10 empty beds that night. And at Warringal Private Hospital there were eight beds that night. - So there were 53 beds available in four hospitals that I checked; all could have taken overflow. - The honourable member also asked about the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. As he would know, state hospitals are the province of state governments, and I would suggest that last year South Australia got $26 million extra from the Commonwealth for hospitals. In their budget paper only $20 million extra appeared. So not only did they not put in an extra cent themselves; they took $6 million of our money and put it somewhere else. So if there is a problem in Adelaide public hospitals, ask the state government where the money has gone.  - </DOC>

 - The most recent ABARE figures available to me for 1998-99 indicate that, in that year, there were 20 million cubic metres of round wood removed from Australia's forests, both plantation and native - a 20 million tonne transport task. Further to this, we are seeing the commencement of hardwood harvesting from the plantation sector, some 800,000 tonnes in the southern areas of Western Australia this year. In fact, it is predicted that, within a few years and probably within the lifetime of the Roads to Recovery Program, we will see an additional 20 million cubic metres of forest products coming from these plantations. In three separate areas this will be represented by a single area of about five million tonnes of pulp wood which is sufficient to resource a world class pulp and paper mill which, of course, would create significant additional employment in regional areas. It would also remove and in fact reverse Australia's $2 billion trade deficit in forest products.Of that 40-million-tonne transport task, every log of wood at some stage will travel over a local road and over local bridges. Furthermore, the Commonwealth's commitment on road funding as it assists forestry does not cease with the raw product. We are putting significant funding into the Pacific Highway which, of course, allows for the cheap and efficient freight of brown paper bags from the McMillan electorate to Brisbane. That is a very important thing, as we know. They are very important items. The reality is that there are many factors relating to this transport problem. In the electorate of Bass, for instance - I do not know whether that member is present today - two bridges have been drawn to my attention. Because of the inadequacy of those bridges, the trucks that pass over them can load only to 60 per cent of their legal entitlement. With these sorts of circumstances you can have all the potential of a pulp and paper mill but if your freight costs are even a cent too high you lose the international opportunity. Politics killed the last major pulp mill in Tasmania - we refuse to have economics defeat them in the future. -  - That's cost. I guess there is some humour in saying `economic factors'. McMillan might be doing some laughing. There are 28 separate electorates throughout Australia that benefit directly from forestry and that can invest large amounts of money to improve their local roads, which are so essential to the efficiency of this particular industry. There are many members, such as the member for Eden-Monaro, who have made representations on these issues to me over time. The member for Wannon has made special representations on many bridges because the plantation sector is developing in the high rainfall areas of Australia and those areas have many significant small bridges in their road networks and these bridges need upgrading if this industry is going to reach its full potential. - I have had representations from many members - the member for Gippsland, the member for Corangamite, the member for Ballarat, the member for Wide Bay, the member for Longman and the member for Blair. All of these people have made representations. There are a couple of other names on my list of 28 electorates, like McMillan and Burke, and I can tell you there has not been one word about this great funding package and the factors it will deliver for these people and these workers. On this road package, the Labor Party are crawling around like a dachshund at a greyhound meeting. They do not want to know about it. </DOC>

 - As of the current financial year, Centrelink is able to get an extra $5 million from my department if it meets all of 12 key performance indicators. There are 12 key performance indicators: 10 of them relate strictly to service to job seekers and two of them relate to breaching. The two key performance indicators relating to breaching are designed to ensure that (a) Centrelink and Job Network members have a common understanding of what reasonable behaviour is and (b) Centrelink will not breach anyone without following due process and ensuring that natural justice applies. Let me point out that Centrelink is able to not meet the breaching KPIs and still get more money, or it could meet the breaching KPIs and not get more money. The simple fact is that, yet again, there are no targets. The number of breaches is not set by the government; it is set by job seeker behaviour. What this government is on about is ensuring that people obey the rules, and what the opposition obviously seem to want is the old days when almost any excuse would do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for this question. It gives me an opportunity to report to the House on the considerable progress that has been made since the COAG meeting in April of last year to adopt a national approach to illicit drug diversion. Diversion means that drug users can either commit to treatment and rehabilitation or take the consequences of their action in the criminal justice system. When this national approach to diversion was announced by the government, it received widespread support in the Australian community. We allocated $220 million to this initiative, including funds for treatment, education, law enforcement and research. In November of last year, I launched a detailed national diversion policy framework following its endorsement by all state and territory governments. The approach is built on a partnership between governments, community organisations, health professionals and local communities. It is a very good example of the social coalition at work.In December 1999, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Tasmanian Premier jointly launched the first diversion agreement. In May of this year, I announced a Commonwealth-New South Wales diversion agreement with the New South Wales Premier, and I launched a similar agreement with the Victorian Premier in August of this year. The Commonwealth expects to launch an agreement with Western Australia in a matter of days and to conclude agreements very shortly with both South Australia and Queensland. Can I record my immense gratitude for the bipartisan approach that has been adopted by state governments working in partnership with the federal government to try to make significant inroads into this dreadful social scourge of drug abuse.Can I say in passing that the national drug statistics released yesterday contained the very pleasing news that there has been a significant drop in heroin overdose deaths in New South Wales to a figure of 296 in 1999-2000 from 491 the year before. That may be only some kind of statistical interruption to a pattern that has caused a lot of concern over the years. We all hope it is not. I take the opportunity of congratulating all concerned in that, both those working for New South Wales agencies and also those working for the Commonwealth.One of the dangers of this debate is for there to be a sense of hopelessness that nothing can be done and that everything that has been tried to date is a failure and is of no use. That is a mistake. There is a wide area of agreement in the community on what ought to be done to tackle the problem. The areas of disagreement on such issues as heroin trials and heroin injecting rooms, although they are significant, mask the fact that in most areas there is enthusiastic cooperation across the political divide between all people concerned in trying to bring about a reduction in drug abuse in the community. I do not think it is a cause that any of us should resile from. We should continue the campaign, and there are some signs that in some areas that campaign is beginning to bear fruit. Certainly the diversion programs are a good illustration of that, and I thank the premiers of the states of various political complexions for their cooperation in the public interest in tackling this very serious problem. </DOC>

 - There has been a significant increase in the number of breaches, no doubt about that. The reason for that is that this government is serious about enforcing the rules. This government believes that the social security rules should be upheld. The reason for the big increase since the years when Labor was in government is not our harshness; it is your slackness. It is the slackness of the Labor government and the appropriate rigour that this government has put into place which explains the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I can inform the House that the September quarter current account figures show significant improvement in Australia's current account position, registering a deficit of $5.5 billion or only around 3.4 per cent of GDP. As I have previously informed the House, the September figures are boosted, of course, by the Olympics, but what they show is that the volume of exports grew 3.8 per cent in the September quarter. Elaborately transformed manufactured exports rose 5.1 per cent in the quarter, rural commodities exports rose 5.6 per cent in the quarter and services exports rose 14.4 per cent in the quarter. So this shows a return to strong growth in exports to a round trend following two years below trend coming out of the Asian financial economic crisis.Notwithstanding that strong growth in exports of 3.8 per cent in the September quarter, the volume of imports grew only slightly at 0.4 per cent. As a result of this, net exports will contribute 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in the September quarter when we get it. Today's outcome is a significant improvement in Australia's current account. The government is forecasting a significant decline in the current account through the year to 4 ¼ per cent from the 5.4 per cent which was recorded last year. Most importantly, net exports will make a contribution of about one percentage point to Australia's GDP growth.I do not think we should get complacent about the current account deficit, and it is something that we must keep a very firm policy handle on. One of the reasons why it is important to run budget surpluses is to build up savings. Can you imagine where Australia would be today if we had not paid off $50 billion of Labor's debt, which would have just gone on to the debt figures and would have made things that much worse. But the government can say that, since it was elected, it has turned away from Labor's wanton fiscal irresponsibility of $10.3 billion deficits and $80 billion rack-ups of debt over five budgets and has made a positive contribution. I think, now that the government has been successful in that, people can give it credit.I would not normally mention him as an economic adviser, but I was rather taken by the comments on the Graham Richardson show, made by the man himself, Mr Graham Richardson. He referred to yesterday's trade figures which of course are not in the September quarter; they will go into the December quarter. He said, `It's very good news.' He was a bit political. I will not read that out - well, he said it was very good news for John Howard and, since you ask me, pretty bad news for Kim Beazley. Some mothers do have `em. He just comes in every time, the old member for Hotham. I was going to spare your leader but, since you insisted, Graham Richardson said `pretty bad news for Kim Beazley' - or maybe he wanted me to read that little bit out. I tell you, Malcolm Farr has been getting some good telephone calls.  - The old advisers over there are isolating him from bad news. I suppose Chris from Warramanga is one of those advisers. Anyway, to come back to Graham Richardson, you did get that admission out of me that it was bad news for Kim Beazley. This is what Graham Richardson said of Mr Howard:He promised us some sort of economic revival and looking at the figures, it is happening. You can make your own judgment as to how much to do with it he is having but one thing is for sure, this is the best trade result Australia has had in decades and I mean decades. It is unequivocally good.From Graham Richardson, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I must say that there is an element of confusion in that he starts off with a question about foreign debt and ends up with credit card debt. He went on to a completely different subject. If you want to ask a question about foreign debt, you ask a question about foreign debt. If you want to ask a question about credit card debt, which is a separate subject, we are happy to answer that too. But I think it is important, if I come to the question of foreign debt, to put some facts on the table. The first is that Australia's foreign debt when the government came to office was 38.7 per cent of GDP and it is now 46 per cent. In other words, it has stabilised over 40 per cent. - Some mothers do have `em, so I think we ought to put it into context. When we came to office, foreign debt was 38.7 per cent of GDP - which, admittedly, is too high. In 1983, when Labor came to office, foreign debt as a percentage of GDP was 14 per cent. Over those 13 years, the foreign debt as a proportion of GDP went from 14 per cent to 38 per cent. Just to put the number on it, because the member for Melbourne does not seem to be able to work it out, under the Labor Party the increase of foreign debt to GDP was 668 per cent. As I said, under the coalition it increased 24.7 per cent - so 24.7 per cent compared with 668.8 per cent. I said at the time - and I will say it now - that probably the most irresponsible period of Australian economic management was from 1983 to 1996. Not only was Australia plunged into awful recession, with budgets in deficit and a build-up of $80 billion worth of debt; but also, if you want to look at it in terms of foreign debt, as a percentage of GDP it increased by 668.8 per cent. So the good news is that we have arrested the acceleration of increase in foreign debt, which was started by the Australian Labor Party.The second good point is that the debt servicing ratio has fallen and is now at one of its lowest levels ever. The debt servicing ratio - the amount of exports required to pay the interest on net foreign debt - is now 9.8 per cent. So the percentage of your exports which you are required to pay in relation to foreign debt is 9.8 per cent compared with its peak under the Labor Party of 20 per cent in the September quarter of 1990. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that the Labor Party boasted that it would produce a recession as a consequence of its mismanagement in 1990. The last point I want to make about foreign debt is that this government can make this claim: it has not added a dollar to foreign debt, because this government has not borrowed a dollar since it came to office. In fact, having paid back $50 billion of Labor Party debt, what that means is that, whatever it is now, it would be at least $50 billion higher had the Labor Party still been in office. That would be the case, even leaving aside the fact that they would still have been running deficit budgets right into 2000-01. The Labor Party may not be able to acknowledge, it but as even Graham Richardson said - Graham Richardson, their ideological mentor; the man who taught them all of their tricks; the man who knew even more about electoral matters than the member for Lilley himself - this is `equivocally good news, the best trade result Australia had in decades, and I mean decades'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - The Prime Minister asks whether I have got time to outline the social benefits, and I have not really, but I will make a bit of a go at it and cover some of them. I attended the first National Rural Roads Congress in Moree earlier this year. That was a landmark event in highlighting the importance of local roads not just to economies but also in local social benefits. It brought together some of the best thinkers on road infrastructure in this country. I should note in that circumstance that I did not see the member for Batman there. The congress revealed that rural roads support the social fabric of rural communities and regions, and the efficiency of local roads makes a very significant contribution - and I think this is important - to education and health standards in rural communities.Interestingly, a survey conducted by the Country Women's Association of Australia, the CWA, in conjunction with the Office of the Status of Women, found that, when women were asked their priorities for government spending in rural areas, 69 per cent believed that roads should be the priority - a quite surprising figure; indeed, one that one would not normally have expected to have been the case. The reason given was that improved rural roads were most important to women of all ages, in places of all sizes, whether in remote localities or large country towns, because, as they explained, there is an intrinsic relationship between such things as good roads and a good education. Indeed, the inadequacy of rural roads is a disadvantage to attracting teachers to rural areas; it reduces attendance at schools, in some cases quite dramatically; it forces parents to send children to boarding school at an early age; and it forces families to relocate to larger centres in the interests of their children's education. An Australian Local Government Association survey into the effects of poor access in wet weather on school attendance of Australian children showed that one-third of the nation's rural and regional council areas are affected. Surprisingly - and, I would have to say, of some concern as well - the survey also demonstrated that, in around a third of our rural councils, school buses still operate on roads that are closed to heavy traffic during and following wet weather. So there can be no doubt that poor roads contribute to a reduction in educational opportunities - at a time when those educational opportunities are more important than ever to all Australian children, particularly those in some of the more remote parts of the country.  In the survey, 25 per cent of councils indicated that poor road access had serious implications for the delivery of health services. Councils indicated that on average there were five instances each year when it was not possible to get a patient to a hospital by road in the event of an emergency. These points touch on this very real issue of the social benefits provided by rural roads to health, to education, to the normal running of a decent social life and to interaction with people in your community. In that circumstance, I have to say that it is just impossible to fathom the Leader of the Opposition's belief - it really is - that the federal government's $1.2 billion injection into local roads is unnecessary or trivial.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the allegation. The allegation was investigated thoroughly by Family and Youth Services in South Australia. They interviewed all of the parties involved, undertook a thorough investigation and found that no further action was required - no charges to be brought. It seems to me that what the member is doing is impugning the professionalism of the authorities who have the capacity to make a judgment in relation to this matter.I said yesterday in relation to the matters that were raised by the honourable member for Bowman that, in relation to each and every one of the issues that I assume he will continue to raise, there are appropriate authorities for those matters to be raised with and where thorough and proper and professional investigations can be brought. What is particularly relevant in relation to the matter that has now been raised is that it is obviously predicated upon advice from the party that he referred to specifically - one of the nurses - and nurses have a quite clear legal obligation in relation to what they should do. - No, I am concerned that people who under state law have a moral and a legal responsibility to report those matters seem to be pressing those buttons now, rather than reporting them at a time when reasonable steps could have been taken, if they believed the child was at risk, to provide that protection.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He, of course, is a person who pushed so very hard for the Pacific Highway - I seem to recall a $3 billion program. In fact, this is the biggest exercise that governments in this country have been engaged in in infrastructure since the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The area that you are asking about is the Central Coast, represented in part by the member for Paterson, who, I seem to remember, was not very enthusiastic in his support for the Pacific Highway. He really did not support it at all. But it is no wonder that in this case people on the mid-North Coast have been very keen to support the package. Port Stephens has around $2 million and Hastings around $4 million. We have had the Labor mayor for Hastings saying, `The road funding package will have tremendous economic spin-offs for our region. It will help to boost economic growth and employment opportunities in the Hastings' - not a bad endorsement. The Greater Taree City Council is receiving well over $4 million. The response from the mayor there, Councillor Mick Tucker, was: It is absolutely marvellous news for the needs of our local roads network.He added that council had already set aside an additional $1.6 million in this year's budget for roads and bridges. So he said that we have a major roads program under way. Then there is the Great Lakes council. It is receiving $2.3 million. Mayor John Chadban was very happy not only with the funding but with the fact that the payment will be coming direct from the Commonwealth. He thought that was a very good idea because he had a bit of a concern about the sticky fingers of state governments getting in the way. I do not think he was referring to Queensland, but he certainly had that concern. I have to say that I have another quote in relation to this, and this is a favourite of mind. I will read it to you:Roads are one of the most important issues in regional Australia today. In an area like Great Lakes, which has a burgeoning population and tourism as a mainstay of its local economy, the state of roads is not important, not significant but paramount.Do you know who said that? It was the member for Paterson. - He wants more money; he has just confirmed it. - It was the member for Paterson, the Great Lakes advocate, who said that on 20 September, recognising the importance of local roads and calling on the federal government to allocate more money. Of course that is exactly what we have done. We agree with him - on this he is right. They are not just boondoggles; they actually need attention. But, unfortunately for the member for Paterson, there is a problem -  - He digs himself in deeper - he really does - because he has a problem. - The member for Paterson has a problem and that is quite clearly that the Leader of the Opposition says that these works are trivial and unnecessary. So the member for Paterson is saying local roads are important and ought to get more funding. He gets funding from the Commonwealth government, but his own leader will not acknowledge that they are important. He still regards them as unnecessary. - For that matter the member for Batman does not have much impact either. He was actually with the member for Paterson when the member for Paterson said we ought to be spending more money because it is of paramount importance. But it obviously has not yet registered with the Leader of the Opposition that this is an important issue, because I want to quote something he said the other day as well. Ian Mickel, the president of the Western Australian Municipal Association, was a caller to radio 6PR last Tuesday. He called to welcome the federal government's $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery local road funding package, but he was not too impressed with the chief boondoggle opposite. He had this to say:Here in Esperance we have been arguing for more road funding from the Feds for a long, long time.He went on to say:It was rather interesting, and I am particularly concerned, we have not been able to tie in the federal opposition to this issue because, with a four-year program and just a year to go to a federal election, it is absolutely essential that we get a clear commitment from the Labor Party that this program will be ongoing. Otherwise it is not worth much to us at all. Mr Beazley, when he was in Esperance last week, I tackled him on this and - wait for it - three times I brought him back to the question of the commitment of his party, if they were elected to government, committing to these rural road funds, and he didn't. He just talked - well, he does do a lot of talking - away from the subject. He did not give me a response at all. I note he is still making statements about fuel prices. He is not talking about road funding at all. I think road funding is absolutely essential to us in Esperance.Esperance happens of course to be in the Leader of the Opposition's home state. So three times - I have been there several times - the Leader of the Opposition was asked to commit his party to supporting this package, and three times he turned down the opportunity. He refused to commit himself. I wonder just how the member for Paterson feels about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. Parents are speaking out now, loudly and clearly, about their support for the government's $22 billion school funding package. Unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition does not want to listen to these parents. The New South Wales Parents Council, representing over 332,000 children attending non-government schools in New South Wales, have, I believe, written a letter to all members in which they say:We urge you to support the immediate passage of the bill without amendment.The Parents Council goes on to say:The funding mechanism established by the legislation has been three years in development. ALP, Opposition and Democrat members and senators showed little interest in the scheme during that period and parents are now extremely concerned that the progress of the debate on this legislation puts the Commonwealth funding for school education, both government and non-government, at risk for 2001.The South Australian Independent Schools Board says:The winners will be parents and families now able to better choose the education that best suits their children.And they go on to point out the regional dividend:Thirty South Australian regional and rural schools from Ceduna to Mt Gambier will benefit.Parents and parents organisations are being treated with contempt by the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is playing games with the lives of families and preventing schools planning properly for next year, and every day that he delays signals his contempt for Australian parents. In a famous example of Beazley speak, which is becoming very popular on the backbench of the Labor Party, he says he does not want to shoot the hostages, but he certainly does not mind roughing up the hostages a little bit. He does not mind making life difficult for them. As I have said in the House on many occasions, the Leader of the Opposition has form in this area. His strategy at the last election, which we remember - engineered by Pezzullo and Angley, as the team was then - cost him his shadow minister, who now sits up there like a vulture on the back bench, hanging around just waiting to see what happens. We remember what the member for Werriwa said at the last election campaign about the Labor Party and Mr Kim Beazley's education policy. This is what the member for Werriwa said: Mike Pezzullo, Chief Policy Adviser, and John Angley, who wrote for Kim as Finance Minister and had no involvement in the education area, rewrote the bloody thing - that was the member for Werriwa's term - so they stuffed it up.And the same advisers have done it again with schools policy. The Daily Telegraph summed it up very well this morning. It said: `Save the hostages Kim and shoot the brains trust'. The Leader of the Opposition should stop treating Australian parents with contempt and get on and pass the bill.</DOC>

 - I get a lot of emails and I see a lot of material pass across my desk. I have got to say I have not seen that one. Let me simply say to the honourable member for Paterson that when the government's announcement in relation to road funding was foreshadowed to the joint party rooms earlier this week I can assure you that the reaction was little short of rapturous in terms of the welcome that was extended by all my colleagues to something for people in rural and regional Australia and the cities.The take-out this week of the road funding announcement is the complete fool the opposition leader has made of himself on the subject. His great line was that this was going to be totally skewed towards rural electorates. As soon as we talked about road funding, without any thought as to how the government might do it, he raced in immediately and said, `Oh, this is going to be entirely for National Party electorates. It's going to be entirely for rural electorates.' The reality is that this money is being distributed in accordance with a Labor Party formula: it is being distributed in accordance with the formula established by state grants commissions in the early 1990s when the Keating government was in office here in Canberra. So, once the state gets the money, it is then distributed not in accordance with who holds the electorate, but in accordance with the formula worked out; a formula worked out by state grants commissions. That has left the Leader of the Opposition, who regards road funding as trivial and unnecessary, in an absolutely ridiculous position. There is not a member opposite who does not want this road funding for their electorate. There is not a council anywhere in Australia who is not grateful to this federal government, because we are providing a 75 per cent increase.Might I observe that next week the annual meeting of the Local Government Association of Australia will be held here in Canberra. Not surprisingly, I have received an invitation to address that gathering, and not surprisingly I have accepted the invitation. I will have something to say at that gathering about this government's record on road funding - a record of which we are immensely proud. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. As the House draws to a close for the year, it is timely to look back on the introduction of a significant extension of the safety net for the benefit of Australian workers. I thank the member for his question because he and members on our side of the House have been strong supporters of putting in place a scheme to ensure that, when workers find themselves out of a job and without their entitlements, there is assistance in their hour of need. We also amended the Corporations Law to deal with people who have been in breach of the Corporations Law. In terms of practical help, the fact is that, when you lose your job and do not get your entitlements, rather than having to wait on the possible chance of some recovery two or three years down the track it is very important that support be provided to workers in that situation as quickly as can be achieved.I am pleased to say to the House that, since the introduction of the scheme and in respect of insolvencies starting on 1 January this year, 1,125 employees in 70 insolvencies have been helped. In the most recent case, for example, which was Victoria Knitting Mills Proprietary Ltd in New South Wales, 19 employees were helped with $70,000 to go towards their entitlements. If the New South Wales state Labor government had supported those employees and likewise matched us on a dollar for dollar basis those employees would be getting nearly 80 per cent of their entitlements. That is real assistance when people need it.I have been asked whether there are any alternative policies. The fact is that the Labor Party has not only opposed this policy; it has opposed supporting workers in their hour of need. Furthermore, it has used what little political influence it has to encourage the state governments not to support our policy because it is a coalition idea. For the basest possible political motives you have turned your back on workers in their hour of need. Are there any alternative policies? There are no alternative policies. The things that you have said, to the extent that they are coherent, would cost a packet, have no international precedent and would impose costs on good businesses to pay for bad businesses. Even the ACTU has called on the Labor Party to support the scheme that is in operation. It is the only national scheme.As we go to Christmas, it is a national disgrace that the Labor Party turns its back on workers when they need a bit of help. I conclude by saying that the scheme has not happened by chance. It has happened because for 13 years when the Labor Party was in office it never lifted a finger to help workers in this situation. It took a Howard led government to ensure workers were helped. I conclude by paying a tribute to the people within my own department who have worked very hard to make the scheme a reality and who I know are dedicated to ensuring that we help workers when they need it. It is about time the Labor Party stood up to be counted when it comes to helping workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He has been railing on about it in this place, trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. As the Prime Minister has made quite plain, allocations between councils within each state - let me come to that aspect first - are strictly in accordance with the formula adopted by the States Grants Commission as established and applied under the previous government. For that reason, as I said earlier in my speech introducing this landmark reform and initiative, any suggestion that the allocation to councils has been manipulated to favour the electorates of government members is completely scurrilous. The outcome is the same as it would have been under your formula. It is your formula. It is your approach. The only other comment I have to make is that, in relation to the historical methodology for allocating local road funding between states and territories - . -  - This is the answer. - And this is a member who was in here this morning casting `dispersions' on my educational background. I am just coming to it. -  - They are obviously not interested in the answer. The historical methodology for allocating between states and territories threw up a couple of not major but significant anomalies that we felt needed to be acknowledged. The key one to my way of thinking was that, even on the most superficial glance, South Australia was being done in the eye in terms of what we thought were important - population and road distances. In terms of the claim that the member for Batman has been running around this place, I make the observation that, so far as I know, there are no members of my party in South Australia. I just make that point on the way through, in light of what he has been saying. - We'll have a go at it if you like. We'll see if we can do something about it.  - The allocation is based on historical precedence - in other words, the long-term approach that has been adopted - but the minister responsible for local government has been indicating some concerns, particularly in relation to South Australia. But the allocation is based on historical precedence and on the entirely legitimate considerations of the length of local roads and of population. I think it is scurrilous, absolutely without foundation and, most significantly, without credibility to claim that this package is a pork barrel any more than it is a boondoggle.There is no doubt about it: it takes one to know one. The local governments - to whom this is directed - have instantly recognised that this is a very valuable program and one that they want. When it comes to knowing the ALP's capacity to look after people wherever they live in Australia, it certainly takes one to know one. And, since I am talking about South Australia, down there they have the Country Labor Association. South Australians presumably know about it. - Oh, well, that is a pity, because their highly regarded chief, Bill Hender, has just resigned. He resigned because, he said of the ALP:The machine does not like policies which have competent, practical solutions.He went on to say:When I resigned as president of the Country Labor Association they had every opportunity to ask me why, but not one of them bothered. Country representatives know why. I am just quoting in part -  - Well, it takes one to know one. He said:People who think they can get a better deal with Labor are in for a shock.He said:Labor was full of citycentrics - But he corrected himself. - He said:No, not even that. They are so full of their own self-interest, I do not think they are interested in the city either.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When we came to government there were no gap cover schemes available or operating in Australia. The gap, along with price, is one of the two biggest disincentives people have to taking out private health insurance. We have been able to address price with the 30 per cent rebate and from having had two years where health fund premium increases have been very low.I have just received some very good news from the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council. We have never before kept figures on gaps. I have asked PHIAC to do so, and they have given me their first report. In the September quarter, nearly two million medical services were provided in hospital with no gap whatsoever; that is, 60 per cent of all in-hospital services around Australia were on a no-gap basis in the September quarter. About 12 months ago, the best estimate we could have was less than 10 per cent of in-hospital services with no gap; in the June quarter, around 50 per cent. So this number is going up exponentially.In Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, 70 per cent of in-hospital services are on a no-gap basis; no state has less than half of its hospital services on a no-gap basis. Queensland and Tasmania doubled the amount of no-gap services in just one quarter. We estimate that it will plateau at about 70 per cent of services on a no-gap basis before the recent changes to gap cover schemes that passed through the parliament in August come into place. Those will start to show in the March and June quarters next year, and we believe that we can approach 80 per cent of all hospital services in Australia with no gaps whatsoever.The good news is that this has come at no increased cost to premiums. Funds representing 70 per cent of all members in Australia have already advised me that they will not be applying for premium increases next year - that is, they will be at least zero for 70 per cent of members covered, and I hope the final number will be much closer to 100 per cent. So this new gap cover scheme that, as of the last quarter, provided 60 per cent coverage across Australia is at no increase to premiums whatsoever. The honourable member asked me if there were any alternative policies to assist Australians who have private health insurance. We of course are still waiting for this. We have had from the opposition 31 press releases against the 30 per cent rebate and not one in favour. We are happy to be judged by our record.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. I note that unemployment in his area has fallen from 14.1 per cent when the member for Hotham was the relevant minister. It is now 7.5 per cent, which is obviously far too high, but it is a lot better than it was in the bad old days of the Labor Party's government.On Monday, the member for Dickson said:Labor has stated it will not abolish Work for the Dole.Labor has said it, but it has not meant it. In February, the member for Dickson said:There are a lot of things, like Work for the Dole, which actually could be reformed to make sure that they provide proper training.In May she said:We do support some equivalent of the Work for the Dole scheme but the current system is severely flawed.In June she said:Probably we would change the name ...On Tuesday of this week, a day after saying that she would keep the program, she said:If the same money had been spent on training and proper work placement programs many millions could have been saved.The member for Dickson wants to change the structure of the program, she wants to change the name of the program and she wants to redirect the funding elsewhere - in other words, she wants to abolish the program. It is a different name, it is a different structure, and there is no funding for it so it will not exist under Labor. - Mr Speaker, if I have got things wrong, if I have misunderstood the much wronged member for Dickson, perhaps she could call a full press conference this afternoon and clear things up.</DOC>

 - We have not misrepresented the size of the package. It is a $1.2 billion package which you will not commit yourselves to and to which, we note, to this point in time, not one of you has committed to joining us on in insisting that your friends in the state governments of places such as Tasmania actually match what we are doing for them. We have documented -  - How can that possibly be not relevant? - There is no trickery in this at all. The fact is that we have listed every local government area in the country. Many of them do indeed overlap federal electorate boundaries. What is so amazing about that? Surely everyone knows that they have local government areas that overlap. Unlike you, and unlike what some of the state ministers have suggested we do, we have not gone into the business of telling local governments where they will spend that money, that it must be allocated within the boundaries of such and such a federal electorate. We have not gone down that road. Quite simply, every member, including those opposite, has a simple list - and I have not noticed any of them sending it back; none of them will want to deny the money - pointing to the councils which fall within their electorates or, in the case of councils which overlap with other electorates, pointing to the sums of money that each of those councils will receive direct from the Commonwealth government. I would have thought that that was perfectly easy to disaggregate and perfectly easy for responsible members everywhere to accurately reflect in this very widely and very well received program. Of course, it remains the fact that the ALP leader has refused to endorse the package, to commit himself to it. He still believes that this a boondoggle and unnecessary. In addition to that, they have done nothing to join us in what I would have thought would have been a spirit of commonsense, a commitment to economic and social reform by calling on the state governments to match what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Menzies, who certainly is a very competent lawyer who will have a keen interest in this matter. When it comes to the Corporations Law, the Commonwealth has the same objectives today as it did when an agreement was made with the states in 1990. We want Australia's one million companies to have one rule of law, whether they be in Bendigo or Bathurst; we want Australia's millions of company employees to have the same protection under company law whether they are based in Fremantle or in Fairfield; we want Australian industries such as building and construction, transport and storage, tourism and health, to have the same single law applied for companies across Australia; and, when it comes to Australia's seven million shareholders, we want them to have the same information in the same prospectus with the same investment returns whether they live in Launceston or Fitzroy Crossing.We ask: why are the states determined to now put in place a new Corporations Law scheme that could end up with six different laws applying across Australia? Why are they prepared to do it? The states with their current proposal want the ability to cherry pick any new corporate law scheme to suit their individual purposes. At a time when trillions of investment dollars move into companies around the world each day, we have Premier Beattie wanting the 90,000 companies in Queensland to face investment uncertainty as a result of some political stunts. In Victoria, where the member for Menzies is based, Premier Bracks wants 174,000 companies to worry more about political stunts on industrial relations than the certainty of incorporation or the cost of issuing different prospectuses with different laws right around Australia.The Commonwealth has bent over backwards to try to accommodate the states and their concerns in relation to the referral of powers. We have put in place every practical, workable safeguard they have needed to protect the intention of the referral. We have gone further in the corporations agreement to protect state rights than ever before, and the time has come for commonsense to prevail. The Commonwealth stands ready to continue to negotiate with the states in good faith but, ultimately, if the states are not willing to trade, we are left with no option but to implement our own laws based on our own powers. One hundred years ago the states could not agree on a railway gauge across Australia. Today the Corporations Law is as significant. It is vital that we have one system for one nation. </DOC>

 - The fact is that, as I said, the distribution within the states is based on the States Grants Commission formula. Who was it that operated that exactly as it is now for decades? They did, the ALP did. - There is no unfairness in this. As I have quite clearly indicated, both our approach and that of the States Grants Commission plainly seek to weight appropriately population and road base. The fact of the matter is that those opposite do not hold a lot of the larger seats in this country where you have a small population base, very large areas and long road distances. You do not hold much of that country across the nation, and I do not think it is very hard to find the reasons why. Our good old friend Bill Hender identified them pretty well. - I really did not have much to add except that it is very obvious that the Leader of the Opposition has still not got the message that local roads in this country need attention. There are economic and social reasons for giving them attention. The member for Paterson understands that, but he has not been able to convince his leader. We do not know whether he has not been able to convince Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, of the case but the member for Batman has not been able to convince the Leader of the Opposition. - Our good old mate Bill Hender really hit the nail on this one as well when he said, `I'm getting awfully sick of the self-named Labor machine. It's shooting the messenger rather than accepting the message.' - Yes, absolutely.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it draws attention to the government's very important renewable energy bill. I am sorry to say that Labor and Democrat senators are seeking to block this important legislation which has the potential to create between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs, many of them in regional Australia, and to result in investments of $2 billion to $3 billion in renewable energy plants. These plants will particularly benefit regional communities because that is where the jobs will be created. A lot of them will be dependent - one in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales and one in my own electorate - largely on sugar cane for gas, but obviously that is not available 12 months of the year because of seasonable factors. So they need to get some alternative feedstock. In many instances, that alternative feedstock will need to be sawmill waste or some other residue. It seems that it is the unwillingness for sawmill waste to be used in these renewable energy plants that is causing a problem for Labor and the Democrats. They would prefer to see this waste burnt or lost altogether than it to be used in any kind of constructive way. It would be a tragedy if this important legislation, this pro-environment legislation, this legislation that is about recycling and renewable energy, was to be blocked by Labor and the Democrats.There are a lot of concerns in communities like my own and the Northern Rivers that this proposal could be lost. In fact, there was a delegation from the sugar industry in the parliament a few days ago. In my own electorate, in a couple of days more than 2,000 signatures were collected demanding that Labor and the Democrats support this legislation. And I certainly join those calls.But I am not the only one who thinks the legislation should be passed. I am sure the honourable member for Page would also be interested to know that in the Maryborough newspaper yesterday, under the headline `Listen Canberra: we want the plant', the Labor candidate for Maryborough is quoted as demanding that Labor and Democrat senators not put the cogenerational plant and local jobs in jeopardy when voting next on the renewable energy bill. So many people in the Labor Party want this passed as well. I ask the member for Paterson: what is his approach to this issue? One of these plants, as he pointed out earlier, is proposed for his electorate. Is he prepared to sacrifice those regional jobs over some silly deal about green preferences? We have heard a fair bit about Labor Party preference deals lately. This is a deal about green preferences that is prepared to sacrifice country jobs. They could get on to it, pass this bill and allow this tremendous investment to proceed in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and I particularly recognise his concern about the welfare of Australians who are travelling overseas. The House may be interested to know that during the last financial year 3.3 million Australians travelled overseas - 120,000 more than the previous year. I see it as an important responsibility for both me and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that high-quality consular services are provided to those members of the public who may need assistance. Almost 21,000 Australians in difficulty sought assistance from our missions around the world last year, including many who became caught up in trouble spots and areas affected by natural disasters. For example, we assisted many people in East Timor and the Solomon Islands, especially with the evacuations in September 1999 and June 2000; we assisted with those Australians involved with the sinking of a ferry in the Greek islands in October this year; we assisted with those affected by flooding in Thailand in November, and with those affected by the hostage crisis and civil coup in Fiji.Australians can access consular assistance through 154 points overseas. My department has also increased from 47 to 54 the number of locations overseas where Australians can call toll-free to the 24-hour call centre in Canberra. Our advice to Australians travelling overseas is monitored constantly to ensure that up-to-date information is available on travellers' safety and on specific problems in different countries. My department provides online access to consular information via the DFAT web site, and press releases are put out in the normal way. Australia now provides a better quality consular service than that of comparable countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. We will endeavour to ensure that those high standards are maintained and that the best interests of Australians are properly protected when they travel around the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is worth pointing out to the House that the matters which are now the subject of a great deal of coverage in the Australian press arose from the conviction of a member of the Labor Party for a criminal offence. This constant attempt being made to compare a criminal treatment of the electoral roll with the vigorous exchanges that go on in all parties in relation to preselection is an utterly false analogy. The question of an audit of the membership of the Liberal Party is a matter for the party organisation, and whenever I have faced a difficulty in the party organisation in my time as leader of the Liberal Party - as I faced with the Western Australian branch early in 1995 when I returned to the leadership - I have not done what the Leader of the Opposition did: roll over at a national executive meeting. Let the Leader of the Opposition clean up the mess in his own backyard before making false allegations about my colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am delighted to be able to say something about waterfront reform in this country. We have implemented reforms that have been focused on what is good for Australia. We are an export economy; indeed, as the Treasurer has pointed out, recent growth has been largely based on a stronger export performance. We are not a shipper nation but a shipping nation. We are dependent upon an efficient transport system and efficient wharves, whether it is for our farmers, whether it is for our miners or whether it is for our manufacturers who are exporting - and, of course, they have been doing very well.Our reforms have been focused on what is good for the nation. In contrast, Labor have not actually changed their policy position at all. They are still locked into the view that what is good for waterfront workers is good for Australia, and that is not necessarily the case. Not so very long ago, a couple of months ago, the member for Batman said:The Government has been boasting that its hard-line waterfront policies have been working, but these latest figures show that boast is a total sham ...It is not often that I get to agree with the member for Batman, but he is right to assert that we are proud of our waterfront policies. He went on to say at that time:The Government's current policies have taken productivity back to what it was in 1998 ...So I thought we had better have a bit of a look at this. Today sees the release of the December 2000 issue of Waterline, published by the Bureau of Transport Economics, BTE, in my department. It needs to be remembered that John Coombs always said that, in Australia, it would be impossible to get to the target that my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, indicated of a national average of 25 crane movements an hour. The member for Batman always agrees with his union colleagues, so he believed that we could not get to 25 movements either. The BTE reports that, in the September quarter, the average crane rate productivity across the five major ports in this country reached a new, record high of 24.9 movements. That has all but achieved the benchmark set by the government of raising container productivity to 25 movements an hour, and it is worth reminding the House - and the member for Batman, if he is listening - of how far we have come in waterfront productivity. In June 1998, the five-port average crane rate was a paltry 18.7 containers an hour. Since then, we have seen a 33 per cent improvement in productivity. - He asks about costs. I will answer that, with great delight, in a moment. Increased crane rates are not the only good news to emerge. The national average ship rate, which is the rate at which a ship is worked by the stevedores, increased in the September quarter to a new high of 38 containers an hour, eclipsing the 1998 ship rate of 24.7 containers an hour. That is an improvement of 54 per cent. In addition to that, there is the issue of reliability. When it comes to your reputation - whether ships are willing to come here, the rates at which they charge their work out and so forth - reliability is critically important. It shows that we have cracked yet another record. The September quarter berth availability in this country increased one per cent to 95 per cent.In conclusion, the member for Batman has also claimed this government's legacy is `bad management practices' and `low morale' on the waterfront and has suggested `Mr Anderson must be held accountable'. This stands in contrast with the comments of another Labor leader - sometimes a more reliable figure on these sorts of national issues than the member for Batman - and that is Premier Bob Carr. Reflecting on the success of the Olympics, Premier Carr said that our waterfront productivity is up with the world's best.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I can tell her that the government putting its economic house in order has been very important in improving living standards for the Australian public. Members of the House would perhaps recall that last week was the 10th anniversary of the Labor Party putting the Australian economy into recession. The architect of that recession was boasting as recently as last week about how he had succeeded in producing recession. We remember how the Labor Party went about putting Australia into recession. It took the home mortgage interest rate to 17 per cent and the overdraft rate to 22 per cent, trying to bring on a recession, which it successfully managed to do. Good economic policy has started to produce benefits for the Australian public. Today, home mortgage interest rates are around eight per cent, and you can get introductory home mortgage interest rates of around seven per cent. There are improvements in real wages. Under the coalition, real wages growth has averaged 2.4 per cent per year whereas, under Labor, it was 0.3 per cent. Of course, another one of Labor's great boasts was that they managed to depress real wages, which made things tougher for working people.Today the unemployment rate is at 6.3 per cent, compared to a peak of 11.2 per cent when the Labor Party put the Australian economy into recession - a deliberate policy which they put in place some 10 years ago. Since the government has been elected, there have been nearly 800,000 new jobs created in Australia. The secret of improving wages, creating jobs, getting growth and keeping interest rates low has been good economic reform policy, good budget policy and a new taxation system which will take us into the 21st century. We had some evidence about this from the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Wagga last Friday, who, in a very up-beat assessment of the Australian economy, concluded that we have avoided the boom-bust cycle in economic policy and have an excellent outlook for the coming year. - I can see that the Labor Party endorses the good economic prospects. But the important point to make is that this was done in spite of Labor. If Labor had had its way, it would have kept the budget in deficit. You fought us every step of the way when we were putting the budget back into balance. If Labor had had its way, Australia would have a 1930s tax system. I do not think we have heard the `r' word -  -  - No, not the `rort' word. We have heard that `r' word pass his mouth quite a lot over recent days, but I do not think we have actually heard the `roll-back' word pass the lips of the Leader of the Opposition now since 16 July. Australia waits breathlessly to hear modern Labor's plan for reforming the Australian taxation system. This was a political party which fought us every step of the way. When he was defeated, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Wait till we're elected; we are going to roll back GST.' You never hear the word `roll-back' pass the lips of the Leader of the Opposition for one reason: his stand was always that of the opportunist. There was never any principle in his stand on tax reform. He never had a policy, he has nowhere to go and the best thing that can be said is that he failed in his efforts to stop Australia moving forward.</DOC>

 - I mentioned in answer to the question first asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I would take it on notice. I will do that, and when I have something further to say I will come back to him. As to the first part of the question, I am generally aware of what Mr Elder did and I would take the opportunity of again reminding the House, because there is a clear pattern of statements by the Labor Party to seek to liken a preselection battle inside a political party - and they go on inside all political parties - with criminal behaviour. It is not criminal behaviour to have a preselection battle. It is not even criminal behaviour to recruit people to membership of your party. It is criminal behaviour to do what the member of the Australian Labor Party in Townsville did that led to her conviction and her jailing. That is criminal behaviour, and that is what started all of this going. I think those opposite, in order to somehow or other protect the name of the Australian Labor Party, seek to liken criminal behaviour with competitive behaviour for preselections. People who seek to do that are of course hiding behind their own vulnerability. I think it is worth while again reminding the House that the Leader of the Opposition boasted about how he was going to clean up the preselection system in the Labor Party but, when there were objections at the federal executive, he rolled over in the face of those objections.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge that she has been a champion for the people that she represents in terms of their needs for road funding. It is worth touching on some of the more recent responses, since we commented on quite a few last week, to the government's roads package. For example, reporting on the area covered by the electorate of Capricornia, the Morning Bulletin - or the `Bully', as I think it is known up there - reported:The $22 million additional federal government funding announced for Central Queensland roads yesterday will be welcomed by all road users.It went on to say:Local authorities have hailed the additional spending capacity that yesterday's $1.6 billion national roads package provides. It mentions that Rockhampton, Livingstone, Winton and other shires will each get more than $500,000 additional funding each year. The Livingstone Shire felt compelled to speak out about this and said that they were delighted with the $538,000 a year federal government boost to its roadworks fund for the next four years. Problems such as Browns Lane and a couple of other roads they mentioned have already been named as possible beneficiaries.To come to an alternate view, it is interesting that in that context the Leader of the Opposition felt it necessary to say something about that part of Queensland as well. He said that road maintenance in Capricornia was ignored in the latest round of federal road funding. He said that there was not any, and that got him a headline - perhaps a very relevant one - `Rural roads were ignored: Beazley'. This is pretty astonishing really when you stop and think that the Australian Labor Party when they were in government were spending around $350 million on local roads. That is in very stark contrast indeed to our Roads to Recovery Program where Commonwealth funding will not only be boosted to record levels but be over double what Labor were putting into local roads. So, while we are increasing expenditure on this vitally important part of the national infrastructure, Labor's cake was getting smaller. It appears nothing is set to change. You asked in your question about alternative policies or whether there were any impediments to the way forward. Yes, there is one. Yet again, the Leader of the Opposition refused to confirm whether or not he would support the Roads to Recovery Program in Queensland. The reality is that we have made a very substantial commitment to this particularly important piece of national infrastructure. It is quite apparent that the Leader of the Opposition still sees it as trivial and unnecessary. People right across Australia are wondering whether or not they will see any commitment at all to their local roads needs from the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for his question. The issue of tendering for the Athens Olympics is one of great significance to the government. All members would be aware of the great technological and contracting expertise that was accumulated in Australia in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics. We took the view that we wanted to take commercial advantage of that with regard to the Olympics in Athens in 2004. The issue the member alludes to is that some Australian contractors are being excluded from tendering for projects for the Athens games in 2004 because of a government procurement agreement that our nation is not a party to. We have taken a number of steps in addressing this. On 19 October I wrote to my counterpart, the Greek minister responsible, expressing our extreme concern with regard to the exclusion of Australian firms from that tendering process. I have also written to the EU Trade Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, in the same regard. He has responded in a positive tone in terms of the consultations he is going to have with the Greek authorities on this.We have all seen the departure of the former Olympics minister from the New South Wales government to take up a position elsewhere. We are certainly hopeful that he may be able to exercise some influence as well with his new-found connections in that part of the world with regard to Athens in 2004. For the interest of the member for Calwell, we will continue to actively prosecute, through all avenues that are open to us, the case of Australia's contractors in their getting access to this market and being able to use the expertise. As I say, I have already engaged the assistance of the Trade Commissioner in the EU in this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. As I advised the House last week, the groundbreaking Employee Entitlements Support Scheme has now helped over 1,000 workers. It is the only national and viable scheme available to help workers. The government are obviously pleased with the progress we have made in the last 12 months to introduce this extension of the safety net. We did have a meeting of the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. I am sorry to say that the states are still fighting amongst themselves. The states still have no viable alternative. They have no agreed alternative. They are bickering amongst themselves as to the design of any alternative, leaving it more stark, more clear and more obvious than ever that there is only one alternative and that is the scheme that the federal coalition have put in place. We have put this scheme in place against the fierce resistance of the frontbench of the Labor Party, who have not been prepared to support workers in their hour of need. Why? For one simple reason: because a Howard government was prepared to help workers and they do not want to publicly acknowledge their own shortcomings in being prepared to stand up for workers in their hour of need. I was therefore pretty interested to see a report in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. Usually, the Daily Telegraph is pretty good on these issues. Members will remember this headline back in June: `Reith: workers' friend'.  -  - I take the volume of interjections as a mark of respect from the Labor Party for the fact that we are prepared to do something. - Mr Speaker, I know you support it. - One of the reasons the Labor states are not too keen to support this is that the federal leader of the Labor Party is saying to the state Labor parties, `Don't support the Howard government's scheme because it would make us look as if we weren't prepared to help workers.' So I was pretty amazed to read in the Daily Telegraph, this time on Saturday, a heading which says `Beazley buoys workers' hopes'. This apparently followed a meeting between the Leader of the Opposition and the AMWU with the workers at STP. We have a scheme for eligible workers to assist them. What did the Leader of the Opposition say to these workers? The state secretary of the AMWU said:Mr Beazley has indicated quite clearly to us that he will go after this lot in parliament.Rather than standing up for workers, rather than saying to workers, `We will help you,' the fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, is using every ounce of influence he has to prevent these workers getting some help. You are prepared to say, `Oh yeah, I'm full of sympathy,' when you have got the workers there, but you are not prepared to honestly say to them that, when you are in the parliament, you and your lot do all that you possibly can to prevent these workers being assisted. If you take one of the last payments made to some workers in New South Wales, they got just under 40 per cent under our scheme. They would have got nearly 80 per cent if the Labor Party in New South Wales were prepared to support them.It is gross hypocrisy for the Leader of the Opposition to be saying to workers, `I'd like to help you,' but when he is here in Canberra to do everything he possibly can to make sure they do not get any help. This is a disgrace for the Labor Party. They are not prepared to support the coalition and match us on a dollar for dollar basis. That is what the Labor Party ought to do. You may not like our scheme, but it is no good saying to these workers that you are prepared to help them. The fact is that you are not prepared to help them and, worse still, you are working against the interests of workers in their hour of need. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The schools legislation currently in the Senate - a $22 billion bill - is the biggest investment in schooling ever by a federal government. It greatly increases funding for both government and non-government schools. Members of this House should be aware that Commonwealth funding for all schools dries up on 31 December unless the Senate passes the legislation this session. There will be no money for schools next year unless the Labor Party is prepared to act and pass this legislation. For many schools, next year's budgeting has already been seriously disrupted by the irresponsible activity of the Labor Party in failing to pass this major piece of legislation. Schools, teachers and families around Australia are demanding that the Labor Party now does the right thing. It is not acting out of principle. It has no principles. It has no policy. All it wants is to delay the legislation so it can call another doorstop, another press conference, to placate its supporters in the Australian Education Union. As the Australian Parents Council said:The States Grants legislation puts in place Commonwealth funding for Australian school students for 2001-2004. It should be passed without further delay so that all schools can adequately plan for 2001.The Chief Executive Officer of the Independent Schools Association wrote to the Leader of the Opposition on 3 December and said:The delay in the passage of the bill holds no comfort for anyone with children at a school in Australia.The Reverend Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Commission has said:The Senate should pass the States Grants Bill 2000 intact.The Most Reverend R.H. Goodhew, in a letter to the Prime Minister on 22 November, said:Acting on behalf of the Anglican Church of Australia, I previously joined other church and school leaders in signing a joint letter calling for the speedy passage of the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. I confirm my ongoing support for the early passage of this legislation.The member for Dobell stated a few weeks ago that the Labor Party would be passing the legislation in the Senate. But rather than allowing the bill a smooth transition, the Labor Party has obstructed and delayed this bill, no doubt hoping that it can gain a few extra points, at the expense of schoolchildren and parents, with its supporters in the Australian Education Union. Shazza and Dezza want this bill delayed because they want their pound of flesh. But the Labor Party - the party without a policy on schools, the party without a policy on school funding, the party with a leader who is not prepared to get the Labor Party into a position where it has something credible to say - is continuing to delay this legislation. The Labor Party should put the welfare of Australian school children and parents first, pass the legislation and end its political point scoring.</DOC>

 - For most farmers, the past year has been one of considerable achievement. A number of new records have been broken in relation to farm exports. In fact, in each of the last three months agricultural exports have exceeded the previous record. Wool exports are up by 31 per cent, and I hope that that demonstrates a beginning of a change of fortune for this great Australian industry. There have been significant increases in wine exports. Our dairy producers continue to expand their share of world markets. Our exports of fresh horticultural produce have grown yet again; in fact, they are up 30 per cent over the last five years. There are more exports of Australian timber products, and aquiculture is the fastest growing of our emerging rural industries. So there are plenty of examples of success stories in agriculture.But as the honourable member mentioned in his question, there are some cases where farmers have had a difficult year, where problems have arisen, and this government has responded to those concerns. We have been ready to assist farmers who are facing difficulties and have been prepared to devote substantial resources to help them through those difficult times. They have had a sympathetic government in Canberra which has been prepared to listen. Again, as the honourable member referred to in his question, often they have had to come to Canberra because their states have failed to take the action that would normally be expected of a caring state government. An example is the sugar industry, which I referred to last week, where the federal government has provided a substantial package of support - in fact, an $83 million package, levering something like $400 million worth of loan assistance. I mentioned last week that the state government also put up a package in Queensland and they had only three applicants, none of whom had yet been approved. Mr Palaszczuk, the state minister, has taken me to task and told me that he now has five applications. I gather he has still not spent a single cent. So the Queensland government's response to the sugar industry crisis was, at best, tokenism and really a sham.When it came to the dairy industry, again the states that acted to deregulate the industry - the three states that abolished quotas that were worth tens of thousands of dollars for many farmers - refused to pay any compensation. They refused to do anything. The Commonwealth government facilitated a $1.74 billion restructuring package to assist the industry through these difficult times. The states did absolutely nothing, with the exception of Western Australia. Only the coalition government in Western Australia have provided any support for their dairy farmers. New South Wales and Queensland stripped the quotas away at great cost and provided absolutely nothing. It is to their shame that they have refused to do anything to support their dairy farmers. I think it is appalling that we -  - It seems as though those on the other side are defending the state governments for ripping away the value of the quota. Are you defending this action, member for Corio? You are shameful. There has been none of their money produced, and you know it. There has been none of their money whatsoever, where we have put in place a significant new package of assistance. In addition, we have reformed the tax system, we have lifted the wholesale sales tax from farm costs and we have lowered income tax for virtually all farmers. We have also lowered the fuel tax for all farmers. All farmers in Australia will be paying less fuel tax this year than for very many years as a result of the action of this government in relation to dealing with farm cost issues. The Farm HelpSupporting Families through Change program helps those individual producers who are facing difficulty. It helps them through the difficult times, puts bread on the table and of course, if need be, supports them with retraining and assistance out of the industry. So this is a government that cares and has been prepared to respond in those circumstances where difficulties are being faced, in stark contrast to state governments which have walked away from their responsibilities. </DOC>

I did notice a very extensive `Investigation' article yesterday in the leading Sydney paper, the Sunday Telegraph. I thought it would be appropriate for me to inform the House of some of the results of the investigation. The article states:A review of the costs by TheSunday Telegraph shows, that four years after the Howard government began overhauling subsidies, child care is more affordable than ever, with prices as low as $4.50 per day per child for some parents. That comes from the Association of Child Care Centres of New South Wales. Further, I would like quote from Frances Bardetta, the President of the Association of Child Care Centres of New South Wales. She said:'The simple truth, if anyone cares to listen, is that this government has spent more on child care than any other government and the industry is in a better state now than ever before. 'Funds that were going in as untargeted subsidies have been reallocated as higher subsidies for parents, so more parents have more choice ...The article continues:'It's not often that we give the Government credit for doing something right, but the truth is, they've finally got this right,' Ms Bardetta said.'They've bent over backwards and fought like demons to make sure that child care is more affordable.It is more affordable because of the good policies that this government has in place. We are making child care more affordable, particularly for low and middle income families. Why? Because there is greater funding going through and there is greater flexibility and choice. We have achieved that through the Child Care Benefit. An additional $900 million will go to the Child Care Benefit over the next four years, which takes the amount that we are putting into child care for the next four years to $5.6 billion. We spent $4 billion for the last four years, which is 30 per cent more than the Australian Labor Party spent on child care in their last couple of years of stewardship.Government member - How much? - It is 30 per cent more than in 1996, and we are spending $5.6 billion over the next four years. That means from 1996 there are 140,000 more children in child care. There are over 600,000 now in Commonwealth funded child-care places. This is a far cry from the lies and deception that are catching up with the opposition over here. The ALP have done nothing to assist child-care services in their term of office or in their campaign to run down child-care centres in the last four years. I would like to quote again from the article in which Mrs Frances Bardetta says:Unfortunately, child care became a political football, and the saddest thing is that a lot kiddies have missed out ...Kiddies have missed out because of the political football that has been played by the Australian Labor Party who love misinformation when it comes to child care or good family policies. The electorate is awake to you now, just as the electorate is awake to your antics and rorting in Queensland. You people have been exposed for what you are: populists in a policy-free vacuum, more interested in - yes, Mr Beazley, you can smile - corrupting democracy in Queensland than you are in good policy. - This government will continue to fight like demons to have good child-care policies, whether they are in the seat of Paterson or in a coalition seat, so families have choice and more money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. Later on this week, I will be participating in the annual joint trade commission meeting with my Malaysian counterparts in Kuala Lumpur. I will also be accompanied by the National President of the Australia-Malaysia Business Council, Alexander Gosling. The objects of the exercise are to continue the healthy trade relationship that we currently enjoy between our two countries on a bilateral basis and also to continue the pragmatic approach that our government is taking to trade policy, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region where we are seeing significant growth again in our exports to that region and, of course, Malaysia is no exception.Two-way trade in goods and services for the 1999-2000 financial year with Malaysia stood at $7.35 billion. In the last 12 months, our exports to Malaysia have increased by 15 per cent. And that is across all sectors, which I am sure all members will be interested to hear, particularly the member for Hindmarsh because one industry in her electorate has just secured a new $10 million contract to supply automotive parts to Malaysia's national car manufacturer, Proton. The company, Castalloy, will be supplying 75,000 cylinder heads a year to the Malaysian automotive industry, and that is an indication of the benefits that can flow from market openings and tariff reform, particularly in relation to the markets into which Australia exports. That will be good news for the people in that seat in Adelaide who work in the automotive industry. As we all know, Australia's automotive industry is now one of our great export performers, exporting almost $4 billion worth of cars and automotive components.Other notable companies that are doing well in the Malaysian marketplace include Note Printing Australia. Malaysia will soon be using plastic polymer banknotes made with technology developed in Australia by Note Printing Australia. We are opening up the services market to Australian companies in Malaysia. Recently the Australian law firm, Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, was appointed to advise Malaysia's electricity utility on the restructuring of the electricity market.One of Australia's fastest growing export sectors is the services sector. An integral part of that is the education area. Notwithstanding a lot of the political hype and commentary that take place from time to time in the media with regard to the relationship between Australia and Malaysia, in the education area Australia is still seen as a significant destination for Malaysian students. At the moment, Malaysia has 18,000 students studying in Australia, which is quite significant, not just in an economic sense by also in the overall bilateral relationship. During my discussions with Minister Rafidah later on this week, we will be talking about a number of those issues, as well as our bilateral relationship and our mutual participation in regional fora, and we will obviously be continuing to pursue our pragmatic approach to trade policy on behalf of Australia's export industries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I know the time, effort and work that he has invested in extending the telecommunications network throughout his electorate - as so many members, at least on this side of the House, have done. Since this government came to office in 1996, it has had a clear vision of what it wants to achieve in this area of communications. Firstly, we want to introduce a competitive market that will provide an array of products and services at a more affordable price and in a more efficient way; secondly, we want to have an innovative regulatory regime that protects the interests of consumers and the public; and, thirdly, we want to target programs that will fund the roll-out of telecommunications in areas where there is market failure.Since 1997, when the area was opened to full competition, more than 50 carrier licences have been issued, and a whole range of new products and services is now available to Australian families, businesses and consumers. The effects of this competitive market are being seen in the prices. Earlier this year the ACCC reported that the prices of local, national long distance, international and mobile calls had fallen. All of this is underpinned by the regulatory regime, including the customer service guarantee. The CSG, which was introduced by the coalition government, has been strengthened recently. It imposes tighter requirements on carriers for the provision of services and the repair of faults. It also requires the automatic payment of CSG compensation by a carrier when service standards are breached. We have other consumer regulatory safeguards, such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the universal service obligation, to provide that protection. Consistent with its election commitment, the government has looked at ways of improving the delivery of the universal service obligation, and we now have a contestable provision for the universal service provision.As to targeted funding, there is a whole range of programs, such as Networking the Nation and the Telstra social bonus, totalling some $1 billion. These programs include building additional rural networks, extended mobile phone coverage on highways, untimed local calls in extended zones, the extension of SBS funding, television blackspot funding, local government fund, building IT strengths, remote and isolated islands fund, Internet access fund and a range of other programs designed to assist people who are in a disadvantaged location or position - especially in rural and regional Australia. So, while we have a clear vision and a determination to bring this about, we are still waiting for the Labor Party to articulate any serious or credible telecommunications policy - particularly in the important area of regional and rural telecommunications service.</DOC>

 - I will ignore the last polemic from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That is the kind of tactic that we have come to expect from him as a substitute for serious policy, which is something that you would never hear from the member for Hotham.The government has substantially reformed the Australian taxation system. We have reformed the indirect taxation system; we have reformed the personal income tax system; we are now reforming the business taxation system. I well recall that the Labor Party, at the time that we put our business taxation changes to the parliament, said that it was opposing cuts in capital gains tax and opposing cuts in company tax. I made it entirely clear that cutting capital gains tax -  - The Labor Party said it was opposed to cuts in capital gains tax and it was opposed to cuts in company tax. It said that if we reformed the whole of the business taxation system then, grudgingly, it would vote for it. In relation to those matters, what have we done? We have enacted the alienation of personal service income measures. Do you recall those? Something that the Labor Party never got around to doing in 13 years. We then enacted the non-commercial losses provisions - something that the Labor Party -  -  - What I said would happen is as follows: cuts in capital gains tax, done; cuts in company tax, done; introduction of alienation of personal service income, done; introduction of non-commercial losses - never done in 13 years of Labor government - done. In relation to entity taxation, the legislation is out for comment. The last leg is out for comment. We invited comments about it; we are taking those comments in, so we can proceed with those measures. I said to the Treasury on entity taxation, `Why don't you go and get Labor's model so that we can put that out for discussion.' And do you know what? After 13 years of being in government, do you know what these people, who are now allegedly interested in tax measures, had done? Actually, their policy looked a bit like their roll-back policy - a blank sheet of paper. We had to work it up from the beginning. We produced an exposure draft, and we put the exposure draft - the last piece of the jigsaw - out for discussion. After we have fully consulted in relation to these measures, we will proceed with our business taxation reform. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and record that one of the many places that I visited during the floods was Narromine in his area, where we met with people from right across the central west of New South Wales who are experiencing very real difficulties. Indeed, apart from my visits to some of the worst flood affected areas, the Prime Minister came and saw first-hand what was happening; so too did the Treasurer and others. I acknowledge too that the Leader of the Opposition went to Walgett in my electorate, where very real difficulties are ensuing even at this time, as floodwaters take so very long not only to reach that area but also to recede.The particular difficulty of this rain event was not so much the floods - which of course looked very graphic on television - but the extent and the length of time that it remained wet. The damage done to crops after people had spent the maximum amount of money on growing them was immense. They were lost right on the point of harvest on many occasions, and in many instances very little or nothing can be recovered from them. Given the relatively narrow economic base of many of the regions that have been affected, it is incredibly important that we ensure that crops are replanted to restart the economy of the region. We gave a commitment that we would cut through red tape, that we would develop a comprehensive package as quickly as possible and that we would recognise that there are certainly farmers out there who have had to borrow so heavily that they are not in a position to borrow any more and need direct income support.So today the government has announced income support for farm enterprises which will be paid at Newstart rates to eligible farmers. We have announced grants for crop replanting to the tune of $120 per hectare to a maximum of $60,000 per farm. Interest rate subsidies on debt will run to a maximum of $100,000 per farm, which actually will provide leverage for up to a million dollars of debt - a very substantial leverage indeed. That will give people the opportunity to get back into the business of restructuring their finances so that they can plant their crops. We have also announced grants of up to $10,000 for small businesses for restoration following flood damage. It should also be kept in mind that small businesses and, for that matter, farmers who may not want to avail themselves of these measures are eligible for the low interest loans that are available under the natural disaster relief arrangements in this country. The New South Wales government is negotiating over the question of how they can be made a little more relevant and more user friendly for those who may need them. Those details will follow in due course. The National Farmers Federation has responded to what we have said today by issuing a statement saying the flood relief was generous. It said that flood relief measures for the victims of the recent floods in northern New South Wales are generous and fair. The president said that the scale of the assistance measures were commensurate with the scale of the disaster, which had affected up to 5,000 farmers and caused an estimated $2 billion damage to crops, farms and infrastructure. Ian Donges went on to say that the NFF is encouraged by the government's commitment to cut red tape to deliver these measures and the decision to ensure that those who need help and are eligible will receive it. He went on to say that, while the government has recognised the need to rebuild the farms, it has also recognised the unfortunate fact that many farm families will lose the financial capacity to pay for daily essentials, such as education expenses. He made another comment, with which I want to say I wholeheartedly concur, that the NFF now eagerly awaits the reaction of the banks to these measures and hopes that they will match the government's generous approach to the victims of the biggest disaster to have befallen rural industry in New South Wales since the Great Depression. So do we. We really do look to the banks, out of self-interest and, I think, respect for their shareholders, to do everything they can to ensure that the economies that have been so badly affected in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland are restored as quickly as possible. Let me also say that I am a little disappointed, to put it mildly, that the New South Wales government has declined to offer any further assistance. So far as we are concerned, the door is still open for New South Wales to come forward and do something else. - Playing politics! All I can say to that is that you apparently do not believe that the New South Wales state government -  - should make an appropriate contribution. We believe that they should. So we do await with very great interest the response of both the banks and the New South Wales state government.</DOC>

 - As usual, one ought to be very careful about allowing the Labor Party to interpret things that have been said on this side of the House. The fact is that the National Party fully supports the objectives of the government in ensuring that the legitimate uses of trusts are preserved but that rorts are eliminated. That is quite simply our position. The party has expressed views on how the exposure draft would work, not about its objectives or the government's objectives. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I have agreed that all responses will be carefully considered and that the legislation will be framed accordingly. That is really all there is to it. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. I have seen those reports. In fact, I think we will introduce three pieces of legislation next year, including a transitional bill. We commissioned a report on the whole question of the procedures for registered organisations, which include employer associations as well as unions. That report was made public. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is also looking at elections within registered organisations, and its report and recommendations have been taken into account. We have had discussions with the parties and we have released an exposure draft on the legislation. We have had discussions with the ACTU and ACCI. We are also mindful of the fact that the Australian Democrats have made it pretty clear that they do not like the bills coming to the Senate to be too chunky: they like the idea of more bite sized chunks. We have taken all those things into consideration and we will put the legislation before parliament at the start of next year. It is basically all ready to go; it is just a matter of making final preparations to introduce the bill.There is no doubt that transparency in the arrangements of registered organisations is important. There have been many cases over the years - particularly in respect of unions - when members have simply not known where the dollars that they paid by way of subscriptions have gone. I have an independent accountant's report from 1998 referring to the books of the Australian Workers Union centrally funded branches which says:In our opinion the AWU centrally funded branches have not kept satisfactory accounting records, including records of the sources and nature of the income of the Australian Workers Union centrally funded branches, including income from members, records of the nature and purpose of the expenditure of the Australian Workers Union centrally funded branches.I noted some very interesting rather more current statements in today's press about what goes on with unions and members' money. There is a report in this morning's Canberra Times about an inquiry that is going on in Queensland. According to that newspaper, a former AWU organiser, Mr Bermingham, apparently told the inquiry:You would go and tell Mike Kaiser that certain memberships had to be paid ... he would ring Bill - that is Bill Ludwig - and money would be left in an envelope on the counter ... in cash.It was probably in a brown paper bag. According to Mr Bermingham:... the fund was set up after a fund-raiser at Brisbane's Hilton Hotel and was run out of the then office of one of the federal MPs.We all know that a lot of federal MPs are basically in the hands of the AWU. Bill Ludwig is so powerful that he does not just put nonentities into the lower house; he has got his son in the Senate. - Let them get it out of their system, Mr Speaker. The fact is that the AWU runs you blokes in Queensland. -  - Brian Courtice was a federal Labor member of parliament and the other day he said this about the control of the AWU - I didn't have to ring him up, mate; he was on radio - the whole country heard what he had to say. - He said:The issue here is industrial power leads to political power leads to legislative power.That was reminiscent of the member for Fremantle, who said:The unions have a disproportionate influence over the Labor Party.That is a significant problem when the leader of the parliamentary party does not have the ticker to stand up to the Bill Ludwigs of the AWU. As the Financial Review said this morning:But the Queensland rorting has dragged into the public spotlight the destructive underbelly of factional politics, where an outside interest group such as the Australian Workers Union can exert influence far beyond its numbers on Labor Party preselections and eventually the composition of the Federal Cabinet.When we announced that we would be taking further action on registered organisations, what was the Labor Party's response?  -  - I would like to hear about it in more detail if it is going to be interjected. - Their response is the response of the ACTU: no way known will they support legislation in respect of further workplace relations reform. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition tackled what has been a significant problem for the Labor Party, and that is the disproportionate influence of some of these unions. They basically own you and a whole lot of those sitting behind you lock, stock and barrel, and the challenge will come for the Leader of the Opposition. The exposure draft is already out, but the Leader of the Opposition's challenge will come in February when he must decide whether he will go along with the ACTU, who just say no - that is their policy - or whether he will support sensible government measures that have been the subject of a lot of consultation and that will clean up some of the financial discrepancies in registered organisations.</DOC>

 - The question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a number of assumptions which are not true, as per usual. Let me say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that any policy decision of the government that diminished revenue of course has an impact on the budget outcome, whether it is in an area of entity taxation or whether it is in an area of excise. I would have thought that was so elementary that you did not need me to confirm it. But since you have asked me I take the opportunity of correcting the record about what I have said in relation to excise. What I have said repeatedly is that the average motorist of Australia, to see any appreciable reduction in the price of petrol, would like to see a cut of about 5c a litre, not 1c or 2c, and that would cost $1.7 billion.  - Per annum. What the government has done is to take the long-term view. We have a long-term policy. You just react to this morning's newspaper headlines. That is a substitute for policy. We have taken the view that to put $1.2 billion into road funding is a far better use of the taxpayers' money than a transient reduction in the level of excise. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows, the price of petrol at the bowser today is uncomfortably high. I do not like it, he does not like it - we at least agree on that - but it is due to the world price of crude oil.   - Labor has a solution. That will be the first solution you have produced to anything in five years. It will be the very first solution that you have produced. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the price of petrol, the high level of which none of us likes, is due to the high price of crude oil. It is also influenced to some extent by the exchange rate of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar. - Of course, all of us follow the relationship between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar, and from time to time we may extrapolate from that relationship the impact from time to time on the price of petrol at the Australian bowser. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went into the area of trusts. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sat in a government for 13 years that never really tackled tax avoidance - Government member - Did nothing. - Did absolutely nothing. To borrow the Treasurer's famous bit of rhetoric, you were going to do it in the 14th year, were you? We were waiting for it. The government remains strongly committed to eliminating tax avoidance through the use of trusts. That is why we have released an exposure draft of our entity taxation legislation. It is not the intention of the government, as the Treasurer said - and it never has been - to penalise the legitimate use of trusts for family and business purposes. It is my understanding that that is not the intention of the opposition either. Maybe they are so out of touch with the legitimate use of trusts by many farmers and small businessmen to imagine that anything that uses a trust is bad per se. It is not. The legislation that we have released is an exposure draft, and the government will carefully consider all submissions on that draft before it decides the final shape of the legislation. But nobody in the opposition or, indeed, nobody in the Australian community should imagine that the government has weakened in its resolve to eliminate tax avoidance abuses through the use of trusts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. Since coming to office, the Howard government has introduced a range of reforms aimed at strengthening the integrity of the electoral roll and electoral processes. The House will recall that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 was passed by the parliament last year. As a result of that legislation, the Commonwealth has twice issued regulations for consultation with the states and territories. The proposed regulations include provisions for witnessing and identification provisions when a person enrols to vote for the first time. The identification provisions require one original form of identification - for example, a drivers licence, student ID card, marriage certificate, birth certificate, passport or proof of age card - to be shown to an eligible witness at the time that the application is being filled in. To ensure that there are an adequate number of witnesses in regional and remote areas, the regulations specify a broad range of witnesses, including teachers, nurses, police officers, accountants, JPs, the Electoral Commission, soldiers and Aboriginal elders. It is not a difficult gate to get through - in fact, it is more difficult to become a member of your local video store than to enrol to vote. So these are sensible regulations that would ensure the integrity of the electoral roll is maintained without placing any undue burden on voters.  It is interesting to note, in view of the number of statements that have been made by the Labor Party and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition in recent days, the attitude and the position of the Labor Party on this issue. The federal Labor Party opposed this legislation in the Senate, and the Labor states have also opposed the draft regulations that have been put out to them for consultation. We are still waiting on those draft regulation responses from the states.But it is interesting again to note that, when this legislation went through the Senate in February of last year, this was stated by Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate:I have said before that what is motivating this is simply paranoia on the part of the government - and I stress that. The government's view, belief, claims, if you like, that there is widespread electoral fraud have never been able to be justified. This is motivated by paranoia on the part of the government; it is not motivated by a desire to ensure that we have maximum integrity in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is the problem.That was in February of last year. But it is also interesting to note that in October of this year, a very short time ago, in its submission to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, the Australian Labor Party stated its opposition with regard to this witnessing on the enrolment. In fact, what this particular submission shows is that the Labor Party is still in denial. The submission states:Putting aside the matters currently before the CJC, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters has not been presented with any substantive material indicating the existence of electoral fraud, despite years of criticism of the enrolment system.In other words, Mr Speaker, if you ignore the evidence, then there is not a problem. What we really need to see is not the huffing and puffing on the integrity of the electoral system by the Leader of the Opposition. What we need to see is support from the states. What we need to see from the people opposite, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, is a call to the Labor premiers to say, `It's about time we had uniformity when it comes to the electoral roll and the manner in which you can enter the electoral roll for the first time.' Labor should support this legislation - not oppose it, as it did in the parliament and as it is still doing in its submissions to the committee. All of the posturing about the integrity of the electoral roll, about cleaning up the electoral roll, amounts to nothing. They are simply hollow words - unless the Leader of the Opposition supports this legislation and the regulations and calls on the Labor state premiers to do likewise.</DOC>

If you want to know about the electoral enrolment details of Nicholas Berman, it is a matter between him and the Australian Electoral Commission. This young man is no longer in my employ. Until yesterday, I never discussed his enrolment details. If you want his enrolment details, you will have to ask him. But we had share accommodation from April 1997 until early 1998. Thereafter, it is a matter between him and the Australian Electoral Commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics company profits survey for the September quarter was released. It showed that company profits before income tax, net interest and depreciation fell by 4.2 per cent in the September quarter but were coming off a very strong base: an 11 per cent increase in the June quarter. So that would be consistent with very strong growth in company profits in June, moderating somewhat in September. Company profits are now 17.1 per cent higher than they were a year ago and, in trend terms, are still rising. The through-the-year growth rate in trend terms is one of the strongest in the 15-year history of the survey.There was one outcome that rather caught my eye. In the Australian mining industry - and I am sure the members for Curtin and Kalgoorlie would be very interested in this, the mining industry being a great export industry - trend mining profits over the year to the September quarter grew by 79 per cent. I am sure that has a lot to do with the efforts of the member for Kalgoorlie, who has led mining profits to a 79 per cent increase over the last 12 months. Manufacturing profits have grown solidly over the year: trend manufacturing profits before income tax grew by 10.5 per cent. In this release the ABS published a new series conceptually closer to the national accounts, showing that profits over the year were 23.1 per cent higher than a year ago. The profit share has risen steadily over the last three years - it is now at historically high levels. Profits accounted for 24.4 per cent of GDP in the June quarter - the highest profit share of the economy in six years.Company profits in Australia have had an exceptionally strong year. There has been some moderation of those exceptionally strong levels in the September quarter, but nonetheless the profit share as a percentage of GDP is at historically high levels. In the last year, the improvement has really been coming in export industries - mining being an obvious one, but also in agriculture, where exports are steadily growing and building on the back of what somebody described recently as a `supercompetitive' export sector for the Australian economy. That is consistent with growth moving increasingly out of consumption and into exports as the world economy strengthens.</DOC>

 - I start by saying that to suggest that the minister had confessed something in her last answer qualifies the interrogator for the `verbaliser of the year' award. The minister has made no confession. Let me bring this little exercise by the Labor Party back into perspective. You have got a situation where the Labor Party are in the political dock in this country because one of their members was sent to jail for criminal fraud. They are in the dock because other operatives of the Australian Labor Party are singing - very musically to the ears of many people - before a Criminal Justice Commission up there in Brisbane. And you are trying to drag the children of ministers into this parliament. That is what you are trying to do.  -  - The minister for sport gave a very comprehensive statement last night in answer to the questions that were asked. I understand that the further allegation has been denied by the minister. In those circumstances, there are no grounds at all to send anything to the Federal Police.</DOC>

We have good news for the people of South Australia, because Westpac today announced -  -  - The Labor Party is not interested. In fact, one of the members of the Labor Party from South Australia has just been criticising it. Today, Westpac announced that it would set up a new call centre in Adelaide, creating 600 new jobs. This will add another $275 million to the South Australian economy over the next seven years, and it makes Westpac the fourth largest employer in South Australia after Southcorp, General Motors-Holden's and Mitsubishi. In response to consumers increasingly using the phone and the Internet for banking, Westpac has come up with this new initiative. Interestingly, last year Westpac received 65 million phone calls, so this is a fairly substantial operation. It already has in the electorate of Hindmarsh a processing centre, employing around 1,650 people, that provides mortgage services for Westpac around Australia.The member for Boothby's electorate is well qualified to accept this new initiative, should it go to Boothby, because the member for Boothby already has the phone centre for Ansett Australia and, interestingly, also has the back-office operations of BT Financial Group run from his electorate. They run an international service operation that employs 430 people and employs some of the very best technology to deliver full back-office services for BT financial services around the globe. New technology is delivering opportunities like this, not just in financial services but in a range of other services. When it comes to financial services, this is further evidence that, when we talk about building a global financial centre, we are not just talking about Sydney or Melbourne; we are talking about all of Australia gaining the full benefit of globalisation and the full benefit of new technology, and that has delivered real jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Literacy and numeracy skills are fundamental to equal opportunity, and of course the lack of such skillls has been shown to be a major factor underlying early school drop-out and prolonged youth unemployment. I am very pleased to report to the House that we are now seeing the most compelling evidence to date of the success of the national literacy and numeracy plan. As members know, all students in years 3 and 5 in Australia are now assessed against the national literacy standards and these results are made public by the states and territories.In the last week, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have reported the results of their year 2000 assessments, which show significant progress over their 1999 assessments released earlier this year. Western Australia has been testing all students in year 3 since 1998 and on average, across reading, writing, spelling and numeracy, in that year some 20 per cent of students were below the benchmark standards. Last year this figure below the benchmark declined to 15 per cent and in the year 2000 assessments we have seen a further decline across all those dimensions of literacy and numeracy to 13 per cent. But this understates, I think, the achievement that is being made in Western Australia, because the reading results were quite outstanding, with an improvement from 12 per cent below the national benchmark last year to some three per cent below the national benchmark this year. At year 5 the percentage below the national benchmark decreased from 16 per cent to six per cent. The ACT results showed a similar improvement of five per cent in year 3 against the national standard in reading but essentially the same result - that is, no improvement - in year 5. Significant gains are being made for indigenous students, with literacy results for indigenous students in Western Australia up nine per cent since last year in year 3 and six per cent in year 5. In the Australian Capital Territory the year 3 indigenous reading results improved 20 per cent over the year.We need to be cautious in making too much of year on year assessments as the new equating process is bedded down. But these results are clear evidence that the national literacy plan put in place by the Howard government is working in those states which are making a strong commitment. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Western Australian government and the ACT government for their work in early literacy. Western Australia has significantly expanded early childhood education, reduced class sizes in the early years, targeted additional resources and established a much higher priority on literacy in the curriculum. What is really exciting about these results is that we are now seeing the first solid evidence of improvement in literacy standards in a quarter of a century. Throughout Labor's entire time in office, there was no improvement in literacy standards. The Leader of the Opposition was one of those ministers who kept secret the results of literacy surveys which showed that there was a significant problem. When we analysed those surveys on coming to office, we found that there had been no improvement in literacy standards in 20 years. Now we are finding, as a result of the national literacy plan put into place by this government, the first significant objective evidence of improvements in literacy in a quarter of a century.It is regrettable that the Bracks government in Victoria, alone of all the state governments, has failed to implement assessments for all year 7 students and has sought to water down its commitment under the national goals. The national social justice agenda of this government in education is now showing major results. Literacy is the most important social justice issue in education, and we will not stop until every Australian child has the equal educational opportunity to which they are entitled. </DOC>

 - Yesterday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did ask me some questions, and the reason that I have not - until now - responded is that Senator Hill responded quite emphatically to the questions that were asked. What you see here, both from the Leader of the Opposition and also from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is the quite disgraceful dragging into this parliament of the children of members of parliament. The reality is that -  - The reality is that, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question yesterday, he said:My question is to the Prime Minister, and it refers to his earlier answer. Prime Minister, are you aware that, contrary to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, two persons enrolled at Senator Hill's personal, private address in Adelaide for the entirety of this year have, in fact, been living in Sydney for that whole period?The questions of where they were living and the time at which they left were dealt with in Senator Hill's answer, but you did not then acknowledge that those two people were his son and daughter-in-law. -  - You did not. You knew that. The evidence that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition knew this is to be found in the response of the Leader of the Opposition last night to a question asked on the 7.30 Report. The transcript is not as vivid as the embarrassment on the face of the Leader of the Opposition when Kerry O'Brien asked:Are you suggesting that the case of Senator Hill's family should be referred to the Federal Police?Not even the Leader of the Opposition had the guts to say yes to that question, because he knew deep down that he had played dirty pool, dragging their family into it. That is what you did. You both knew yesterday that you were dealing with Senator Hill's adult children. Since when has it been a crime in this country for adult children to be enrolled at their parents' address? When did that become a crime in this country? -  - The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition both knew that they were dealing with Senator Hill's children. They must have at least suspected that they may have been living there. - There were explanations given by Senator Hill yesterday about the movements of his children, and I think Senator Hill has dealt very comprehensively with this. But, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not accept the explanation that I give, I invite him to have a look at the transcript of what was said last night on the 7.30 Report. Kerry O'Brien asked the Leader of the Opposition: Are you suggesting that the case of Senator Hill's family should be referred to the Federal Police?If they had had a point there, the Leader of the Opposition might simply have said yes, given the confected outrage that we have had from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition. But, interestingly enough, this was the highly equivocal answer of the now enraged Leader of the Opposition:If any question of rorting in relation to electoral enrolments or the possibility of it or the allegation of it, when directed at the Labor Party, has been referred with alacrity by the Prime Minister to the police force.Why couldn't you have said yes, if you thought it should go to the police? The reality is that even you had been shamed into realising that you had deliberately - and, I think, quite indecently - involved Senator Hill's family in a political debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question and I note that unemployment in his region peaked at 13.6 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It was 6.4 per cent in March 1996 and it is 3.4 per cent now, thanks to the outstanding policies of the Howard government. Work for the Dole this year has gone from strength to strength. There have been 2,800 new projects providing work experience for some 45,000 job seekers. I inform the House that Work for the Dole participants have a 75 per cent better chance than other job seekers of being in work three months after participating. Despite this, the Australian Democrats have said that they want Work for the Dole to be abolished, and this means that any future Labor government might have the numbers in the Senate to abolish Work for the Dole. - At least the Democrats are honest and up-front, unlike the member for Dickson, who wants to change the structure, change the name, remove the funding and still pretend that she supports Work for the Dole. It is like taking away the size, the strength and the speed of an animal and pretending that it is still a horse and not a Shetland pony. The member for Dickson wrote to Job Network members this week. She said:We would like to see Labor's equivalent of Work for the Dole - not Work for the Dole but Labor's equivalent of Work for the Dole - incorporated into the Job Network.Perhaps the member for Dickson might like to have a full press conference this afternoon to detail her equivalent, its cost, its structure and its name.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the details of it. I will make inquiries, and if there is anything I can usefully add I will. Can I say that, in my dealings with Senator Ellison, I have always found him to be a person of great decency and propriety. I have no reason to express anything other than a total sense of confidence in him. I might also observe that I am familiar with some of the affairs of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. I can remember when I first became Leader of the Opposition I was pursued to do something about the overweening influence of one particular individual in that branch. Although I did not have the vantage point of office and I did not have the power of a centrally controlled party organisation which is at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition, I was able to secure the removal of the person in question from the Western Australian Senate ticket without the intervention of a national executive. I contrast that with your pathetically weak effort in relation to rorting in Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. When the Howard government came to office, the productivity record of the Australian waterfront was abysmal. Whilst the Labor Party had been in government for 13 years and spent tens of millions of dollars - in fact, hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent on the waterfront - we were still lagging behind many whom we otherwise should have been well ahead of. When we were first elected, I remember the PM having a meeting with Bill Kelty, at which meeting the issue of the waterfront came up, and the PM said to Bill Kelty, `We think it's a problem, we think Australia could do better and what I suggest is that you have some discussions with the relevant minister to see what can be done about it.'That happened in 1996, and through 1996 and into 1997 we had a series of meetings with the Maritime Union of Australia. The background to those meetings was the frontbench of the Labor Party saying that all was well and nothing further needed to be done. At the conclusion of those discussions with the MUA, it was their view that 19 or 17 or 16, or whatever it was, was as good as it gets. When I said to John Coombs, `Listen, surely Australia can do as well as New Zealand and some of the other countries with which we compare ourselves,' he said it could not be done. What yesterday's figures reveal is that it can be done. I can remember John Coombs saying to me, `Oh well, of course we're committed to productivity.' They were so committed to it that in Sydney, for example, they had an agreement with P&amp;O called the PEP agreement. When it was introduced productivity actually fell. That was their idea of productivity. So it was a bit much when this morning I heard Mick O'Leary from the MUA, when he was asked about the 25 target, say: Productivity is not the issue on the waterfront. It's reliability.The fact is that it has always been an issue, because this is an island continent and we need to be able to get our goods in and get our goods out, and we need to be able to do so efficiently and reliably. The figure at 24.9 is very good, and that represents a 35 or 36 per cent increase in productivity. But that is only part of the story, because they are now moving more containers and doing so with fewer people, which is an even greater increase in productivity. Whilst that is the average figure, in some places they have done better. In Brisbane, for example, it was 16.1 prior to the dispute back in 1998; now it is at 25.8. That is an increase of nearly 60 per cent, which just demonstrates that when all the inefficient and restrictive work practices are cut out we can have a stevedoring industry in this country that everybody, including the workers, can be proud of. Not only have we done very well against that benchmark on the crane lifts; on the reliability figure, which was also an objective that we set - we were looking for a 97 per cent berth availability - we have reached 95 per cent. So we are very close to that figure as well.I am asked whether there are alternative policies. In fact, there is an alternative policy here. The alternative policy of the Labor Party is to repeal the Trade Practices Act provisions on secondary boycotts. Can you think of a worse policy? Can you think of a policy more against the national interest than to give the MUA the right to hold Australia to ransom like they used to? As John Coombs said, `When Labor was in, I could pick up the phone and in 15 minutes close Australia down.' We took that power away from him. What does the weak Leader of the Opposition intend to do? He is going to give it back to him.These figures have come as a result of hard work and the determination of this government to stand up for decent practice on the waterfront. We were subject to a lot of question marks: would we stand firm if it came to the national interest on the waterfront? We did stand firm. We stood firm against a record on the other side where every time the MUA said, `Jump!' your question was, `How high?' That is Labor's alternative policy: give the unions whatever they want and go back to the way things were in the sixties and seventies. I say that Australia reckons that getting to 24.9 is a pretty good result. Most Australians will, I think, oppose a weak opposition leader who cannot even stand up to the trade union movement when we have reached the tremendous goal we did this week.</DOC>

 - I do remember saying that there is a distinction between competitive behaviour for preselections and criminal behaviour, and when I talk of competitive behaviour for preselection I include both sides of politics. Of course there are vigorous preselection contests, and of course both sides of politics have witnessed a situation where there is a great deal of branch vigour - and there is nothing wrong with that.  - Oh! He said, `There's a load wrong with it when it is crook.' You would know about all of that. The member for Barton, for whom I do have some respect, asked me quite a serious question and I am endeavouring to answer it. I say to the member for Barton that I think there is a difference, and I think that difference has been illustrated over the past few weeks.I have to say again that the prominence of this issue in the news in Australia arose from the fact that a member of the Australian Labor Party was sent to jail for a criminal offence and that other people have had allegations made against them. Some of them have made confessions. Some of them, like Mr Elder, have removed themselves from the deputy premiership. All those sorts of things, if they involve any element of criminal behaviour, are one category of behaviour. But, when you are talking about vigorous activity in relation to branches, that is another category of behaviour. My understanding of the matters in relation to Wentworth - and I will check the circumstances after question time; I did hear something of that, but I am not possessed of the details because it is something that is normally deal with by the party organisation - is that there was a reference made to the police. That is my understanding. It is my further understanding - and I will check it again after question time and, if anything I have said is inaccurate, I will come back and correct it - that the police themselves were reluctant to pursue the matter further because it was seen as essentially a matter involving a dispute between different sections of a political party, and those disputes often arise, and that as of now no further action is being taken by the police.That is my understanding of it. I do not regard that as a particularly dramatic confession on my part or, indeed, on the part of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party - if I can be allowed to speak for them for a moment. Those sorts of stoushes go on from time to time in the Labor Party, as they go on in the Liberal Party. You start to get a problem only where money changes hands, where you get allegations of $1,400 in a brown paper envelope. That is when the whole character of the thing changes. I shall be very happy to make some further inquires. I have no doubt that what I have said is broadly correct; if there is anything wrong, I will come back and correct it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore. She does a great job in her electorate; indeed, her reputation there is enhanced by the team of volunteers who help her. I want to acknowledge that. Yes, I am aware of, and I would like to acknowledge to the House that this is, International Volunteers Day.  It is a day when we are celebrating the efforts of voluntary workers right across the country. Remarkably, in Australia over 2.5 million Australians volunteer their services in local communities to help their fellow Australians. It is these volunteers who give their hearts and souls through dedicated and selfless commitment to help other people. We should salute all of those volunteers. The crowning achievement this year for volunteers was the 46,000 volunteers at the Olympics and the Paralympics, which in many ways were launching pads for the International Year of Volunteers, which will commence next year. All of us want to thank the volunteers for the work they do in their communities and, even more importantly, to encourage more volunteers. Through our Stronger Families and Communities package, we are putting in $16 million to encourage new volunteering - $2.5 million will go into 500 grassroots type grants of $5,000 each for which local communities can apply. I encourage them to do so. It is appropriate because, in partnership with the Centenary of Federation, the International Year of Volunteers campaign will highlight the different scope of volunteering, and there will be different themes running for each month of the year. Part of that program is $9 million to go to the National Skills Development Program, which will help volunteers to, in particular, provide communities with skills in counselling, disabilities or financial management. Another area of volunteering that the government initiated is the voluntary work initiative, which is carried out by Centrelink. This is part of the activity test requirements, and people can carry out voluntary work to meet those test requirements. I think the whole House should applaud that 2001 will be a great year for Australia, particularly for volunteers, particularly for the Centenary of Federation and particularly when the coalition government gets re-elected. Most importantly, in all sincerity, it is an opportunity to thank the millions of Australians who have contributed to the development of this nation through their time, energy and talent. I will conclude with the slogan that is being used this year - volunteering: ordinary people, extraordinary contribution; real people, real heroes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question, and I recognise the active interest he has shown in the crisis which, at the moment, is engulfing the Middle East. In this country we are grieved and deeply concerned about the continuing violence between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East - violence that has led to the loss of over 300 lives and to thousands of injuries. Clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and gunmen and the Israeli Defence Force, and between Jewish settlers and Palestinian villagers, continue, although they are now at a lower level of intensity than was the case in October. Indeed, a building leased for future use by the Australian Representative Office near Ramallah was hit by machine-gun fire last week. The use of violence or excessive force is not the answer. We reiterate the call of the Red Cross for both sides to respect, and ensure respect for, the principles of international humanitarian law. Mutual confidence must be restored and the cycle of violence brought to an end. We look to both parties to exercise leadership and restraint and to renew their efforts to build the peace process and a future free of fear and degradation.Today I have announced that Australia will provide a further $1 million assistance to people in Gaza and the West Bank through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the joint Australian NGO appeal to fund medical relief. This amount is additional to the $500,000 provided to the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency last month. This additional government contribution will help provide essential supplies to hospitals in Gaza and the West Bank, and rehabilitative services for the severely wounded and the permanently handicapped.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I do not accept that the ABC has been unfairly treated by this government. The ABC is a very important Australian institution, which provides competition with commercial media outlets in the dissemination of news, current affairs and other programs. It remains the firm policy of this government to continue to provide adequate financial support to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.The 1997-98 budget imposed a 10 per cent funding reduction on the ABC. It is fair to say that, when we came to office, we found not only an $80 billion to $90 billion national debt, that had been largely run up when the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister, but also a deficit in the budget on an annual basis of $10½ billion. We had to do something about that. If we had not done something about it, the living standards of all Australians would now be lower than they are. We took the view that just about every section of the government's operations had to accept some kind of funding reduction, and the ABC was no exception to that. The only area exempted, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, was Defence. Defence was the one area, I am proud to say, that was totally quarantined from the spending reductions that your irresponsibility - I address that remark through you, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition - forced upon the new government.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that ABC funding has been maintained in real terms by the government since 1997 for the 2001-03 triennium. In the current budget the ABC received $642.4 million for operating and non-digital capital expenses. In addition to this, the ABC received $20 million this year for the upgrading of studios and equipment to allow the ABC to broadcast in digital. The ABC will receive a further $16.8 million over the next two years to ensure these upgrades are complete. There have always been complaints from sections of the ABC and from ABC management about the inadequacy of funds. When Labor was in power there were complaints, and those complaints have continued.The government has a great regard - even a warm regard - for the contribution that the ABC makes. It is no secret that on occasions I have been critical of particular ABC programs. I have always been perfectly up-front about that, as I have in my criticism of other news media. But the ABC is an important Australian institution. The government has complete confidence in the board of the ABC, but that does not mean that we will always share the board's view of the funding priorities that we have to meet in relation to different government responsibilities. Any funding submission that the ABC makes will be considered by the government carefully and courteously in the budget context, as has been the case in the past. I reject totally the rather puny attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that we have left the ABC in penury. The figures that I have read out completely repudiate that proposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. It is not surprising that a member who represents a very important defence area of Australia - as does the member for Gilmore, who represents Nowra and surrounding areas - should display, as she has ever since she was elected in 1996, a great interest in defence. This is only matched of course by the interest displayed by the member for Herbert, and the member for Lindsay also displays a great interest in defence. Their interest is equalled by that shown by the member for Hughes, and of course the member for Riverina displays a great interest in defence, as well. So does the member for Macquarie and not leaving out my very good friend and colleague the member for McEwen, who represents that great Puckapunyal establishment in Victoria. I simply make the point that the announcement that I made this morning is of enormous benefit to people all over Australia and I note and thank the Leader of the Opposition for the necessarily conditional support that he has given to the government's white paper. I also appreciate the attitude that has thus far been displayed by the member for Cunningham, who I think has taken a very constructive approach on behalf of the opposition. I will end it at that. I will embarrass him, I know, and I certainly do not wish to do that.This is a very important white paper. It is a white paper that gives a blueprint for defence expenditure and readiness, not only over the next 10 years, but potentially into the decade beyond that. It contains a major commitment to a funding increase. It lays out in very clear terms the government's strategic view of the world and what is required of the Department of Defence. Very importantly, it spells out in unprecedented detail what we want Defence to do, the money that is being made available for each particular defence activity and the way in which Defence should manage the additional funds that have been made available. It is a white paper that will be seen by our friends in the region as being a sophisticated, necessary road map for the defence future of Australia. We took care before the white paper was released to brief regional countries and allies about the contents of the white paper so that there would be no misunderstanding. We explained that this was the necessarily cautious document of a friendly country - not a belligerent document, but rather a document designed to give us the degree of self-reliance and self-capability in defence that the people of Australia expect of its government.As I said this morning when I delivered the white paper, I want to record my thanks for the first-class effort of my colleague the Minister for Defence, who has taken a very close interest in not only the policy aspects of defence but also the management and organisational structure of the Department of Defence. I believe that the white paper which I tabled this morning is a great credit to him and also a great credit to my other colleagues on the National Security Committee of Cabinet. We had many meetings, and I thank all of those members as well as the Minister for Defence, the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General and, sometimes by cooption, the Minister for Finance and Administration. They were lively and in the end extremely productive meetings, and importantly we have produced a document which is a very secure blueprint for the defence future of this country. It is a document that will be seen years ahead as probably the best put together, the most detailed, the most far-sighted Defence white paper produced in the last 20 or 30 years. I thank very warmly all those who have made a contribution to it.</DOC>

 - We have not had a question on this subject since the last time the Labor Party raised it -  -  - He gets so excited, Mr Speaker. We have not had a question on this subject since the last time the Labor Party raised it and said that the government had done something improper in meeting with the Remuneration Planning Corporation, as I recall. I tabled in the House the Labor Party-ACTU report, which was not produced out of consultation with the RPC but written by the RPC with a foreword from the then ACTU president, Mr Martin Ferguson! This rather quietened down the Labor Party's attack on the matter. Then of course we had the Sherman report on private binding rulings, which got a great deal of excitement going on the Labor Party frontbench again about the criticisms of the private binding ruling systems. There was a press release put out by one of the members of the Labor Party - `Sherman report tax shock - the discredited practice of issuing secret private binding rulings' I think it was. I referred that to the Australian Taxation Office. I said, `When was the system of private binding rulings introduced?' The tax office said, `It was introduced in 1992.' I said, `Good heavens! Was that when the Labor Party was in office?' `Yes.' Private binding rulings were introduced as an initiative under the Labor government in 1992. It is now apparently a great scandal that the coalition is responsible for.Then we come to employee share ownership schemes. Labor has made befuddled attempts to make something out of those schemes. I think we would do well to rely on what the Commissioner of Taxation has said in relation to employee share ownership schemes. When asked why the tax office had not asked the government to enact specific legislation to deal with those schemes - which I think is the honourable member's question - the tax commissioner said on 15 November 2000 in a public speech given in a public forum:Our advice to the government has been -  - There is great hilarity that the Commissioner of Taxation would give a public speech - there would be even greater hilarity if Labor Party members had read a public speech. The tax commissioner said:Our advice to the government has been and remains that the tax benefits sought under these arrangements are not available, including because of the general anti-avoidance provisions.That is the advice the tax commissioner has - and always has had. I think I am right in saying that the general anti-avoidance provisions were inserted into the tax office by the coalition government.  - The coalition government introduced the general anti-avoidance provisions - not the Labor Party. As the tax commissioner says, armed with the general anti-avoidance provisions, he now has legislation to deal with these matters.  - The member for Rankin? As I recall, he is part of the AWU faction - a man with a track record of upholding high standards as part of the AWU faction. - As the commissioner said, armed with those provisions, he has the capacity to deal with these matters - which is what he intends to do. </DOC>

 - I am very pleased indeed to receive this question from the member for Herbert who, as the Prime Minister pointed out, has a big representation of Australian defence personnel in his constituency whom he serves particularly well. Whenever I visit his electorate, I note that his contribution is of a high order.The white paper that was released this morning has a number of unique features. It was not drawn up completely by Defence officials in Canberra. The government set out to seek the views of the Australian public - something which had not been done before. By doing that, the team led by Andrew Peacock returned with a very rounded view of community expectations and what Australians thought they should get for their defence dollar. The white paper was put together through consultations with the National Security Committee of Cabinet, to which the Prime Minister referred. That committee was an innovation of the Howard government and has worked particularly well. It gives the heads of the respective departments an opportunity to meet with the ministers concerned and hold across-the-table discussions about important matters. This enables ministers to come to an understanding and an agreement regarding all the issues that are important to national security. I add that the committee played a very important role during the Timor deployment. It met on a daily basis with defence heads to determine policy and outcomes for each day. I commend the Prime Minister for establishing the National Security Committee of Cabinet as a matter of process within Defence, Foreign Affairs and other areas.The white paper was sanctioned by the national security committee, and ultimately by cabinet, so it is very much a whole of government paper - the product of discussion with the people and discussion within both the department and the parliament. Particularly important was the chance to ask Defence what it wanted in terms of capability. We did not go to Defence and say, `Look, here is this amount of money, what are you going to do about it?' We said, `What do you want to meet the expectations of government in the strategic review?' Defence answered that question and, in doing so, did a very unusual thing: it fully costed all capability recommended in terms of personnel as well as the capital equipment. As a result, we were able to put a price on all items. The government took that up and made a very considerable commitment. -  - The Labor Party did not know too much about the pricing of defence matters. That is one thing we found. We know all about pricing, which is something those opposite could not do. Another very important aspect is the question of industry policy within Defence. In this Defence paper we have set out the requirements of capability purchases over 10 years. Those capabilities have been priced and there is a rough timetable for purchases over 10 years. This enables industry within Australia to take a properly planned approach to contracting. It enables industry to space out its orders and to handle international subcontracting. That has not been done in the past, and it will be of enormous help to industry. I am not aware of any past white papers that set out capability details and costings in the way that this paper does. That will be particularly helpful to industry across Australia. That is but a small sample of the differences in this white paper compared with previous white papers.</DOC>

 - I want to correct the question, because it is not my claim that legislation is not required; it is the tax commissioner's claim. The Commissioner of  Taxation has not only claimed that but advised -  - No, I am not blaming the tax commissioner; I am relying on the tax commissioner. - I actually happen to think that the Commissioner of Taxation may know more about the law than the member for Hotham does. That may be a big claim, and I am sure the member for Hotham does not agree with it. But I think I am entitled to take the view that the Commissioner of Taxation may know more than the member for Hotham. Every ounce of my fibre, every dealing with him in question time, has led to a confirmation of that view. So it is actually what the Commissioner of Taxation says. It is not my claim; it is what the Commissioner of Taxation says publicly and it is what he advises the government both publicly and privately. I read it out to you:Our advice to government has been and remains that the tax benefits sought under these arrangements are not available, including because of the general anti-avoidance provisions.That is the advice that the Commissioner of Taxation has given the government. I think the Commissioner of Taxation ought to be relied on. I know that a tendency has grown up amongst the Labor Party now to launch personal and vicious attacks on the Commissioner of Taxation. I know that the Leader of the Opposition has stood by whilst the member for Wills has engaged in the most vicious, vituperative, personal attacks on the Commissioner of Taxation. So I point out again to the House and to the Labor Party that the Commissioner of Taxation was actually appointed by a Labor government. He was actually appointed by a Labor government. He has advised this government that it is his view that the general anti-avoidance provisions enacted by this government are sufficient to deal with any avoidance schemes which are improper; and we intend to rely upon his advice.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the member for McPherson for her question. She is one of so many members of the coalition who are great supporters of the men and women who make up the Australian Defence Force and of our Defence Force -  -  - Yes, you interject, but you have not asked a single question about the defence white paper, which is an interesting reflection of how important defence is to the Australian Labor Party. - It is of no interest to you at all, obviously. The Defence white paper is a historic -  -  - Mr Speaker, they interject but they do not ask questions about the Defence white paper. It is a sad day when our main opposition party has no interest in defence. Since this government took office in March 1996 -  - Since taking office in March 1996, the government has achieved unprecedented expansion in our mechanisms of dialogue and consultation with regional countries and other major powers, on defence and security matters. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, as he always does, but of course, if you never ask questions, you will never know about it. The government has established regional security dialogues with China, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, and this government has also set up political military talks on an annual basis with Japan and the Republic of Korea, as well as Russia, France - which of course is an important country in terms of the Pacific - and Germany, outside of the region. In 1996 at the Ausmin talks in Sydney, the government, with the United States, strengthened and enhanced through the Sydney Declaration the alliance framework with the United States in the context of Asia-Pacific security.The fact is that this Defence white paper builds on the achievements of the government to provide a framework further to enhance our cooperation with regional countries to achieve common interests and ensure regional security and stability. It lays down objectives we seek to achieve in our relationships with the other defence forces of our region, as well as in multilateral security forums - and in particular I refer to the ASEAN Regional Forum. Crucially, it ensures that the Australian Defence Force will have the resources necessary to play a greater role in cooperation with our neighbours, both in Asia and in the Pacific, in protecting regional stability.Finally, the publication of the white paper is, in itself, an important measure to build greater confidence and trust in the region. We have argued, as have others through the ASEAN Regional Forum, that transparency in defence policy and defence planning in the region is a very important confidence building measure. By producing a white paper, by being transparent about our Defence Force, by ensuring that there are proper consultations with our friends and neighbours within the region, we are able to contribute very significantly to building up broader regional confidence in our security.</DOC>

 - The only group that I am aware of that has given support to new generation employee share schemes is the ACTU. I have already tabled the report that was written by Remuneration Planning Corporation for the ACTU, with a foreword from Mr Martin Ferguson endorsing new generation employee share schemes. - No. - For our part -  - And he has been dealt with generously by me too, Mr Speaker. - You have asked me about new generation employee share schemes. The government has not supported those. - The only group that has supported new generation employee share schemes is the ACTU - which, as we know, controls the Labor Party. - The member for Kingston says that the ACTU does not run tax policy. They do not under a coalition government, my friend, but they do under a Labor Party government. All of us know that the trade union movement have a majority of an ALP conference, and they can bind each and every one of you on every issue. They do not run it under a coalition government - which is why, on a new generation scheme, the only group that has supported it is the ACTU, which has control of the Australian Labor Party. The coalition has never supported it. I am then asked about my claim about the adequacy of the law. I repeat: it is not my claim. I act on legal advice from the commissioner -  - The deputy leader says I endorse the claim. No. What I do is I accept advice from the Commissioner of Taxation - which, as I have already explained to the House, I consider to be much better advice than legal advice from the member for Hotham. This is not just what the Commissioner of Taxation said to us in formal advice; he said it publicly. I do not know if you have actually read his speech of 15 November, because if you had you would not have needed to ask the question. - The member for Hotham now wonders who wrote it for him, he says. The Commissioner of Taxation can actually write, you know. He actually writes his speeches -  - and he can actually deliver them. So we now move on to an attack on the Commissioner of Taxation, who was appointed by the Australian Labor Party and endorsed by this government. The Commissioner of Taxation says this:Our advice to the government has been and remains that the tax benefits sought under these arrangements are not available, including because of the general anti-avoidance provisions. Our advice to the government to confirm the law relating to controlling interest superannuation arrangements was at least in part motivated by our desire to protect people to whom these arrangements continue to be aggressively marketed, notwithstanding our clear position on them. The resulting proposed legislation is not a new anti-avoidance measure; it is a confirmation of our view of the existing law, supported by counsel, that an employer and an employee cannot be the same person for the purposes of obtaining a deduction for superannuation purposes.That advice from senior counsel sounds pretty right to me. But, notwithstanding the fact that it sounds pretty right to me, it sounds pretty right to the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner of Taxation advises us to that effect. He makes a public statement - because I suspect he too is aware of the attempt by the Labor Party to undermine his integrity. But I must say that, in all of my dealings with the Commissioner of Taxation, I have found him to be somebody who has dealt with integrity, if I may say so. His integrity measures up quite well alongside that of the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and acknowledge the wide support on this side of the House for the white paper, which was released by the Prime Minister this morning. The white paper emphasises the critical importance of people as a key element of defence capability. The government recognises that a key requirement for addressing all contingencies is a substantial pool of highly competent military professionals. The Australian Defence Force's weapons, equipment and systems cannot be of world-class capability without first-class people to operate them.Over the last 100 years, Australia's armed forces have earned an enviable reputation for toughness, resilience and also resourcefulness. We have seen that in East Timor and we see it operating today in the Solomon Islands, in Bougainville and in other posts overseas. When the government came to office in 1996, only 42 per cent of the then full-time ADF were in combat or combat related roles. Under the government's Defence Reform Program, the target of that force was set at 65 per cent of the total force of the Australian Defence Force. That was an increase of 8,000 personnel at the sharp end, the business end, of the Australian Defence Force. The white paper initiative announced today will see this increased by another 4,000, to see the full-time strength of the Australian Defence Force rise to 54,000.Issues such as good leadership and policies that recognise the very special nature of service in the Australian Defence Force are high on the government's agenda. Job satisfaction, remuneration packages and health and safety, as well as career and lifestyle aspects, need to be addressed in terms of the Australian Defence Force's evolving role. Let me make this quite clear: the government demand unique service from members of the Australian Defence Force. The white paper outlines how this government will support them in the task that we ask of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The government also recognise that high levels of education and training are fundamental to a modern Australian defence force, and improvements on this front will help Defence attract and retain the people it needs in the future. In addition to addressing the requirements of the full-time ADF, the white paper foreshadows a significant enhancement of reserve capability. The white paper recognises that the reserves are becoming an increasingly important element of the total force and a unique source of additional, particularly specialist, skills. Under legislation that is currently being considered by the parliament, reservists, their families and their employers will benefit from protection measures for civilian jobs and a financial support package to employers and also to reservists.Finally, the white paper details a $30 million initiative to strengthen and expand the Australian Services Cadet Scheme, and I know that that is strongly supported by members on this side of the House. In tandem with this extra funding and support to the cadets, the government is also pursuing a national training framework for cadet scheme participation.These three elements that I have spoken of today reflect the government's absolute commitment to one of the most worthwhile youth organisations and youth development programs in our country and stand in stark contrast to the policy silence that is coming from the other side of the House. The white paper continues a range of initiatives that reflect this government's total commitment to the people as a key element of our defence capability both now and in the future.</DOC>

 - I am naturally aware of the Senate committee report. However, I do not believe that the report has produced any evidence to support suggestions that there was any inside knowledge available to people who had an interest in this issue. Indeed, if you look at the record of trading associated with EU quotas, you will note that there was substantial trading particularly in the month of November, because the rules in relation to EU deliveries changed on 1 December. Naturally, everybody who was interested in exporting to Europe was very keen to make sure that their deliveries were in place by 1 December. In fact, if you look further at the deliveries, you will notice that in the subsequent three months there is a total of only three trades in the whole three-month period. Obviously, there was considerable interest in delivering quota early to take advantage of the old rules before the new and much tougher rules came into place. The fact that there were going to be changes in the way in which the EU quota was allocated was telegraphed by my two predecessors. Something like a year's notice or more had been given. The decision I made was made on 23 December 1999, or thereabouts, for quota deliveries to begin on 1 July 2000. So substantial notice was given about the changes that were to be made.  The most important point to emphasise is that the changes were designed so that those people who delivered beef to the Europeans - the farmers and the processors - actually received the benefits of the premiums associated with that trade. There are substantial costs associated with delivering to that market because of the rules that exist to supply to that market. As those costs are substantial, it is vital that the benefits from that trade go to the producers who have to wear those costs and to the processors who have to meet the standards. This decision was about delivering, to those who performed in the market, the benefits from that market, rather than having them shared among traders. The decision has been overwhelmingly supported by the Cattle Council, the Australian Beef Association and by all of the processors who are involved in the trade - the entire industry - and it has been warmly welcomed throughout agriculture. Yet, once again, we have the opposition taking the side of the middlemen, the people who take the cream off this quota without contributing anything to the effort. I believe the decision I made at the time was correct. It has already substantially benefited farmers and those involved in the industry, and the industry is very much the better for the changes that were made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. Indeed, in government ranks the member for Dunkley has been rechristened as `Bruce Billson-Scoresby' - hyphenated, of course. As part of the Roads to Recovery package, the Prime Minister and I have announced an additional $400 million for the National Highway and Roads of National Importance programs to develop key arterial links in outer metropolitan areas in Australian capital cities. The additional $400 million will be allocated over four years, commencing in 2001-02. This funding represents a very substantial 12 per cent increase in the level of Commonwealth funding for the National Highway and RONI programs. Details of the new project will be unveiled next year, once the potential projects have been assessed and prioritised. To come to the second part of the honourable member's question, I have to say that I have been made aware of the support that exists in the community for the Scoresby Freeway. Indeed, the members for Dunkley, Deakin and Aston in particular have been unceasing in their lobbying and recommendations for consideration of this road. I have come to the conclusion that, in the long term, it might be cheaper for the taxpayer if we build the road instead of wearing out the carpet in the office. Yesterday, at their request, I met with a large number of council representatives from south-east Melbourne who provided me with quite a bit of detail on the benefits of the project as they see it and a lot of evidence in support of the project. Those councillors informed me that the Scoresby transport corridor has great strategic importance. They tell me that manufacturing and production activity in the corridor is a major source of exports for Australia and could increase gross domestic product by around $150 million. Those were the essential points made to me.I was very interested to note yesterday that, valuable as the overview was, and given that the member for Dunkley in particular often points to the value of this project for Frankston, the Mayor of Frankston did not contribute to the debate. That was reflected, too, by the Bracks government. Despite their recent rhetoric, they have not shown the commitment to this project that has been forthcoming from federal members and local councils. We have been hearing about this for a long time from the members here; we have not heard too much from the Bracks government, but they are now playing catch-up. In fact, while we are now suddenly told by the Bracks government that this is the most important priority imaginable, they have not given the federal government a formal project proposal at all. All we have had is four paragraphs in a generic forward document. As if this was not bad enough, against that background the Bracks government then called on the federal government to invest $65 million in the Scoresby Freeway - while they refused to put up any money for a road which is their responsibility. It should not be forgotten that the Scoresby Freeway is the responsibility of the Victorian government. But the Bracks government, having opposed the development of the Scoresby Freeway at the last election, having not put any of their own money in, nor having given the federal government a formal proposal, now want us to believe that they are genuinely committed to it. All I can say is that, if the Victorian government will match the enthusiasm of the members and the councils that I met with yesterday, I can only conclude that we would have to look seriously at it.</DOC>

 - It is complete nonsense to suggest that the scheme discriminates against producers in Western Australia. It does deliver the quota to those producers who actually deliver to the European Union, and only registered meatworks that have a European ticket are able to deliver to that particular market. The reality is that there have been no properties in Western Australia with EU registration. I understand that some may seek to apply for it - and, from time to time, there have been registered meatworks. Unless you have a registered meatworks in Western Australia for the EU quota, you cannot send any beef.This new system also includes a reserve quota - this year, 600 tonnes and, in other years, 400 tonnes - that will be available for new players, and it is available free of charge, to be allocated on merit. So, if there are producers or processors in Western Australia who want to deliver to the European Union, they can apply for access to this special reserve quota and they will be able to deliver. So the system does not discriminate against any state. The new quota is available to any new player who chooses to enter the field. In addition to that, I emphasise that the quota goes to those who actually perform. If Western Australia wants to participate in this market, the opportunity is available to it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his interest in the economy and for the work that he is doing in cleaning up electoral rorts in Australia. - The Australian Bureau of Statistics capital expenditure survey, which was released today, showed that private new capital expenditure rose 0.6 per cent in the September quarter after a fall of 1.9 per cent in the June quarter. This was higher than market expectations, with the median market expectation of a fall for the quarter. The increase in capital expenditure was led by plant and equipment, which increased 5.4 per cent, whilst buildings and structures investment fell by 12.4 per cent in the quarter.The capital expenditure survey also has expectations for the year 2000-01 as a whole, and the fourth estimate is 1.3 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate for last year, 1999-2000. This again is led by estimates of a rise in plant and equipment being 4.7 per cent higher than the equivalent investment for 1999-2000. These figures do not map directly into the national accounts, but the plant and machinery figures support the government's MYEFO forecast of an increase of four per cent in business investment over 2000-01.One of the things that have changed for capital investment for the business sector as a result of the new taxation system is that now business can claim full input tax credit for all embedded taxes in plant and equipment. That was not the case under the Labor Party's tax system. Businesses paid embedded costs, through the Labor Party's tax system, when they were investing in plant and equipment. As a consequence, for the same amount of investment, it becomes cheaper for business because they get an input tax credit. One of the reasons why the new taxation system is helping business is that it is making investment goods cheaper for business so that they can invest.The outlook for solid investment reflects favourable fundamentals in the Australian economy, healthy corporate profitability and balance sheets, relatively high levels of capacity utilisation, strong world growth and a boost to Australia's competitiveness flowing from a stronger world economy and exchange rate effects.</DOC>

 - The government's policies for the funding of TAFE in Australia have produced an increase of some 270,000 places in TAFE over the last three years. Our policies have been designed to ensure that there is a growing number of opportunities in the TAFE sector, in the university sector and in the schooling sector for those Australians - young Australians and mature age Australians - who want to increase their level of skills. The coalition has done this by guaranteeing to the states funding increases in real terms and by requiring the states to grow their systems through efficiencies. Over the last three years, the states - with one exception, the state of New South Wales - have responded extremely well to the funding guarantees that the Commonwealth has put in place. The Commonwealth has made a similar offer of guaranteed funding in real terms over the next three years, challenging the states again to continue to make their state systems more efficient. I have also made an offer to the states to give them greater flexibility in relation to capital funding so that some of the money which is no longer required to build up facilities which are now in place can be used for recurrent purposes. In fact, this will provide the states with an additional $52 million over the coming three years for their TAFE funding.So the Commonwealth are making no threats to the states. The fact is that we have a National Training Authority agreement which expires at the end of December. The Commonwealth have made an offer to the states. We are still engaged in discussions with the states on the terms of that agreement, but I can assure you that there are absolutely no threats to cut off funding. On the contrary, the Commonwealth aim to continue to expand opportunities for Australians in the 21st century to increase their level of skills and their job opportunities to support the rapidly growing economy that we have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. There have certainly been a number of industrial campaigns in the last 12 months but of particular importance has been a campaign run by the AMWU, the CEPU and the AWU - three of the owners of the parliamentary party here sitting opposite - under the title Campaign 2000. They basically set out to abolish, to repudiate and to override the whole system of enterprise bargaining in this country and to go back to a 1970s style industry approach, which would have been an absolute disaster for the manufacturing sector, which even the Labor Party must themselves know, because they used to be in favour of enterprise bargaining. I am pleased to say that, whilst there have been quite a lot of costs incurred on business, jobs lost and reputations tarnished in this campaign, the campaign ultimately has been repelled by the employers in the state of Victoria. Enterprise bargaining will remain, it has not been broken and we will not be having industry bargaining in the manufacturing sector. The attempts to bring the manufacturing sector in Victoria to a standstill have likewise been unsuccessful.The achievements have really been due to two essential factors. The first is the absolute determination of the industry not to do deals which would destroy the future prospects of the industry, and I pay tribute to the Australian Industry Group, which have been very firm in the best interests of their members, including of course the employees in manufacturing. The second factor is the strength of the coalition's Workplace Relations Act, our commitment to enterprise bargaining, and our laws and proposed laws against unlawful behaviour. When I refer to proposed laws, I refer particularly to the pattern bargaining bill, which, whilst it did not go through the Senate, did hang like a sword of Damocles over the parties, their knowing that the Democrats would have had a lot of pressure on them to pass that piece of legislation if the industrial action had got out of hand.I can report that, of all the agreements reached in Victoria, only 10 have slavishly followed the union's pattern demand. Every other agreement, I am advised, has had variations against the proposal. But also of interest is that a lot of businesses have seen the employer and the employees get together, do their own deal and tell the union what they think of them. Thereby we have seen an increase in `direct with employee' agreements, the 170LKs, which of course the Labor Party are basically opposed to. A number of union officials have admitted their own failure. One of them said the other day that they admit that the campaign to date has been a fairly hard slog, which is a bit of an understatement. I am asked about future policies. The fact is that the Victorian Labor government supported the unions as they set out to wreck manufacturing in Victoria, and the weak Leader of the Opposition here never at any time stood up against Campaign 2000. When it came to a choice between the jobs of workers in Victoria in the manufacturing sector and doing what he was told to by the AMWU, on every occasion he chose to support the line being imposed on him by the AMWU and to put aside the interests of the workers. If you had had the same situation replicated, Labor's policy would allow industry-wide strikes to take Australia back to the 1970s. They would allow union sanctioned pattern bargaining to take us back to the 1970s. They would allow secondary boycotts, which would mean more strikes undermining Australia's reputation, and they would force employers to do deals with unions where the unions did not represent workers in a particular workplace. The government have stood firm. We have stood firm on enterprise bargaining and, finally, we have stood firm on the rights of workers to have jobs and not be pushed around by union leaders interested in a political agenda rather than the interests of their real membership in the union movement.</DOC>

 - I am quite happy to answer it. I do remember saying that. I am not, frankly, aware of the other comments that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to. Can I say that you asked me what I will do. I will repeat my view to the Western Australian branch. As you know, in relation to these matters, you frequently yourself - through you, Mr Speaker, I address the Leader of the Opposition - have said that there are some matters where you have a view which is different from the view of the state parliamentary leader. I happen to hold the view that it would be -  -  - Mr Speaker, it does not pain me at all to say that I do not have the constitutional power within the councils of the  -  - I do not have the constitutional power within the councils of the Liberal Party organisation to enforce a personal view in relation to preferences. As the Leader of the Opposition will know, the organisational structures of the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party are very different. Let me say, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition, that there are some things about the Labor Party organisation that I would not wish on the Liberal Party of Australia, but there is one thing about the Labor Party organisation that I would wish on the Liberal Party of Australia, and that is that our federal executive had more direct power to intervene in relation to state branches concerning matters affecting the federal party. But we have a tradition within our branches where the state divisions strenuously resist that authority being handed over to the federal executive. That is a matter of record. I am not running away from that, but I will have the opportunity tomorrow when our federal executive meets to express my view on this. It is quite well-known what our constitution is. I think One Nation ought to go last. I think One Nation ought to go behind the Australian Labor Party all around the country. That is my view, and that is a view I will continue to repeat in any Liberal Party forum around the country. It is my view and I will use whatever authority I have to bring that about. I cannot guarantee that I can require state branches to do it, because that is not part of our constitution, but I have stated a clear position and I will continue to state it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson. I can update the House on the new tax system. The Australian Taxation Office has now had total lodgements of over 1.6 million business activity statements. It thought that there would be 1.6 million to 1.7 million, and it has now achieved that target. One thing that the House will notice as the year draws to a close is the absence of questions from the Labor Party on the goods and services tax. It is remarkable how this House is finishing compared with how it began. I remember reading in the Weekend Australian on 19 February 2000 a position piece by Paul Kelly setting out where he thought politics would go this year. He said this:The entire country knows what Labor plans for the historic 2000 year - a relentless negative campaign against the GST, a tax it intends to keep. This is political fraud on a grand scale.We had packets of salad, we had Hockey Bear pyjamas, we had questions day after day - and I remember coming to this dispatch box - about the way in which the GST would destroy Australia as we knew it. We had prognostications from the Leader of the Opposition on how it would be a nightmare; we had prognostications on how it would destroy the Australian way of life, how it would boost inflation, how people would be put out of work. This was the intensely negative campaign of the Australian Labor Party which they thought was going to surf them into office over the course of the year. As the year ends, do we hear anything about the GST?Government members - No! - We have had one question today about GST. Do we have one mention of the roll-back policy? On 8 July 1999, Mr Beazley said:Labor's commitment will be to roll back GST.On 20 February:We will roll it back as far as we can.On 21 February:We are going to roll it back. We are not going to leave it static; ...On 9 May:I have said before and I say again there is no doubt about our commitment to roll-back.On 2 June:People should not be in any shape or form confused about whether or not we will. We will roll it back.On 19 June:There will be roll-back of the GST under a Labor government. It is not an if or but, but there will be roll back. The last, most famous comment is from the speech to the AMWU conference in Newcastle on 19 July:I can tell you today we won't be moving a millimetre from our stance of roll back.No, you will not be moving a millimetre. Fifty-five kilometres - that is the only way in which you are moving from it.Yesterday, apparently, a document was distributed at the caucus meeting. This is a four-page document of the caucus of 5 December 2000 which sets out all the great achievements of the Labor Party over the year. It is in double spacing. It made great reading, and I would like to thank whoever sent it to me for sending it. - No, it was not yours. No, it came in a brown paper bag. I think it might have come from the AWU faction. Anyway, I looked through it to see the great achievements as reported to the caucus, and the great achievement in relation to roll-back, which is -  - Actually, I ask the Labor Party to table the document - it is their document. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows what it is. - Anyway, the great achievements do not include roll-back, except that, on roll-back, it says:Labor is committed to rolling back the GST on mobile homes and on boarding houses.That was it - that was the roll-back policy: `Labor is committed to rolling back the GST on mobile homes and on private boarding houses'. This is what we have been fighting about with tax reform all these years - mobile homes and boarding houses. There is not even a GST on private residential rents on mobile homes and boarding houses, so I do not know what they are going to roll back.We have gone through the most amazing tax reform that Australia has seen and the Labor Party has not been part of it. The great restructuring of the Australian economy has been completely opposed by the Labor Party - as Paul Kelly said - as `a matter of fraud'. You never had any intention to repeal the GST. I feel sorry for the backbench of the Labor Party who were primed up to oppose a tax which their leadership always wanted to keep and now intends to keep. And when they are asked how they are going to roll it back they come up with what? Mobile homes and private boarding houses. We come to the end of this year with one of the great tax reforms of Australian history. The people on the coalition side can proudly say that the coalition led and that the Labor Party opposed and that in all its efforts to frustrate needed economic reform it failed Australia.</DOC>

 - The reason for this question is a report in today's Australian newspaper. That is the only new information that the member has put before the parliament on what he alleged very early in the piece would be a `drip, drip, drip' approach to dealing with this issue. So let me deal with that issue first. Yes, I am aware of the allegation - I read the Australian newspaper today. I am advised that ACM did receive a report from its staff following the removal operation. My department has requested a full report on this matter from ACM senior management so that the facts can be established; in particular, what action was taken following the receipt of that report. If the alleged incident did occur, I would, as my adviser indicated, regard it as being completely unacceptable. If it did occur and ACM took no disciplinary action as a result, I would regard that as being equally unacceptable. However, until such time as I have this additional information I do not think it is appropriate that I should have a concluded view in relation to the matter. But let me say that there is an allegation, which has not been substantiated in the newspaper report, which gives no name as to the person who suggests -   - No, it did not, but there were particular reasons for that, which I have elucidated before, where there was factual information upon which we could proceed. This event, if it occurred, occurred in September 1999. I have a statement from Peter Vardos, the Assistant Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who was the senior DIMA officer on board the removal flight, codenamed Operation Joseph, that occurred on that day. He was accompanied by a fellow DIMA officer who performed interpreting duties. We believe that is the incident which is referred to. The statement reads:The removees, who had arrived in Australia unlawfully on two separate boats, comprised 75 males and 10 females. Thirty ACM officers provided the security escort services for that flight.The removal was undertaken by Malaysian Airlines Boeing 737. The flight departed Port Hedland at approximately 11.00pm on the night of Wednesday 1 September, and arrived in Fuzhou at approximately 8.00am on Thursday 2 September. There was one refuelling stop enroute, at Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia.The important part of this statement is to this effect:There was a heightened level of security for that flight. A group of male removees had been involved in an incident at Port Hedland detention centre prior to the removal and were assessed as potentially non-compliant during the flight. Given the security concerns and, as the aircraft was full, there was no unnecessary movement through the aircraft during the flight by removees or DIMA officers. My DIMA colleague and I were seated at the front of the aircraft.I did not witness any of the incidents alleged in the article in the `Australian' to have occurred on that flight. I was not made aware of any of these matters by any ACM officer during that flight, upon completion of the flight or since that time.I first became aware of the allegations during the evening of 5 December 2000 when I was informed by the Minister's Media Adviser that the `Australian' intended to publish the allegations in an article today.The only point I make is this: without any name of a person making an allegation, without anything of substance, with a statement of that sort, I do not know why there should be any different approach taken in relation to this matter. I suggest that if the standards that have been asked to be applied in this case were applied in relation to allegations against any of you, you would be taking a very different view of the matter. - Mr Speaker, I have read the document almost in its entirety, and I do not think there is anything that I would regard as being inappropriate to be on the public record.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Blair for his interest in this matter. That question follows on from the Treasurer's earlier answer to a question in relation to facts and figures and the GST. I just happen to have a copy of Choice magazine, published by the Australian Consumers Association. The Australian Consumers Association has never been prepared to be the mouthpiece of any government, but it undertook a survey of prices. I thought this could be very interesting. The first paragraph of the survey says:They said your weekly grocery bill will drop after the GST - and they were right.In July the Australian Consumers Association conducted a survey of 138 supermarkets in 24 cities covering a range of goods. It sent its surveyors out -  - I will come to the member for Paterson in a minute. It covered everything: Nescafe, Vegemite, Lipton teabags, Sorbent tissues, bacon, butter and Cold Power laundry detergent. Coca-Cola - I remember that incident - went down nine per cent. Where is Michelle Grattan? Go Cat biscuits, down nine per cent; Just Juice, down nine per cent; Pamolive soap, down nine per cent. And the ACCC said prices would go down only one to two per cent.Overall, prices fell on average by four per cent after the introduction of the GST. If the Labor Party believe in roll-back, what does that mean? That means higher prices under the Labor Party. It is quite informative to look at some of the places where the survey was conducted. The member for Ballarat will be pleased, because prices went down three per cent in the supermarkets in Ballarat. The member for Herbert will be pleased, because in Townsville they went down six per cent. In the electorate of the member for Richmond, who has always been a strong defender of the GST, prices at the supermarket went down three per cent. In the electorate of Bass - and we remember the Examiner incident; but the member for Bass is not here - prices went down six per cent. If the member for Bass thought she had a problem with the GST, she now looks like the member for Lowe, which is even worse than the GST impact. - In the electorate of the member for the Northern Territory, who sits behind the member for Bass, prices went down four per cent in the supermarkets -  - In Wollongong, they went down five per cent -  - The member for Fraser has made numerous comments in the House about prices going up, particularly car prices, from memory. At the supermarkets in Canberra, prices went down five per cent after the introduction of the GST. We well remember the survey by the member for Melbourne. It came out at roughly the same time as that survey undertaken by the Australian Consumers Association. If you remember the member for Melbourne's survey, he only published prices that went up. He forgot all the other prices. - Prices went down in Melbourne by two per cent at the supermarkets after the introduction of the GST. This is not just our information; it is also the information from the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley now looks like the member for Hunter; he is completely gone; he just kept going! - The member for Lilley's own survey - the Labor Party's own survey - indicated, and we will not forget this, that, after the introduction of the GST, prices fell in 26 out of 27 supermarkets. If our own survey through the ACCC indicates that prices fell after the introduction of the GST and if the Labor Party believes in roll-back, what does that mean for consumers? If under the Australian Consumers Association survey prices went down after the introduction of the GST, what does the Labor Party's policy of roll-back mean for consumers? Up prices go. And if the member for Lilley's own information indicates that prices fell - the Labor Party's own figures say that prices fell after the introduction of GST - what does roll-back mean for consumers? Roll-back means higher prices. Roll-back means the bad old days of high supermarket prices. Roll-back is a bad policy. The Labor Party is now distancing itself from roll-back. We are going to remind it that in every supermarket in every electorate roll-back means higher prices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. It gives me an opportunity to put a number of factual matters before the parliament and to indicate clearly why the response I give is deliberate and detailed. I have read, as the member has, some of the reports in newspapers to the effect of the assertions that he has made today. I cannot vouch for the truth or otherwise of them. But what I can tell the parliament is that in 1996 the government undertook a tender process -   - in order to test value for money and to improve service delivery in detention facilities. The Australian Protective Service, who were at the time the detention service providers to the government, did not tender. It is important that people know that. Following an exhaustive tender process, Australian Correctional Services Pty Ltd was selected from a number of tenderers. The actual service delivery has been subcontracted to Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd, ACM, which is the operational arm of ACS. As part of the contract negotiations, both company and senior personnel were subject to independent probity checks, which revealed no problems. The tender process and the contract negotiations enabled the department to articulate a clear statement of requirements and standards to be met, and reporting requirements in the area of delivery of detention services. Such arrangements had not existed before.ACM's service delivery in detention centres must meet the quality levels established in the immigration detention standards. These standards set out the service provider's obligations to meet individual care needs of detainees in a culturally appropriate way while at the same time providing safe and secure detention. They were formulated in consultation with the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office and to ensure consistency with our international treaty obligations. The contract sets out a reporting and contract management regime. A performance monitoring procedure has been built into the detention contract to ensure compliance with the immigration detention standards. It includes - as I have said before - a range of incentives and sanctions as a means of ensuring high quality service provision, which clearly link payment to performance standards. The fact is that the contract, by its very terms, deals with the issues of further contract negotiations. It is important, in the context of those negotiations, that they be undertaken with probity and that nothing I say in any way compromises the officers who have to undertake decisions under those contracts. So I think it is quite inappropriate for me to be invited to comment on a matter which might jeopardise the Commonwealth's position in relation to dealing with those issues. The detention service contract entered into under a general agreement covers the delivery of detention services at immigration detention centres at Villawood, Port Hedland, Maribyrnong and Perth. The delivery of these services has been subcontracted from ACS to ACM. The general agreement requires us to negotiate with ACS in good faith on an offer it has submitted for the provision of detention services under the detention services contract for a further three years from 22 December 2000. There is a period of exclusive negotiation with ACS which extends until 21 December 2000. At the end of that period the department can decide whether to go to the market for the provision of detention services, if it is not satisfied that the contractor has performed all requirements of its contract to a satisfactory standard, the service standards provided by the contract represent the best industry practice and the offer of a further term represents value for money. In order to allow adequate negotiations for an approach to the market if the ACS offer is not accepted, the department has agreed to extend the period of the current contract to 21 December 2001 on existing terms and conditions. As I said, those negotiations are afoot. They have to be carried out with probity; otherwise, one might well prejudice those matters and leave them open for litigation. The only other point I would make is that I do not have a predetermined view in relation to these matters. I know the opposition does. It has a view that detention matters ought to be handled only by the government. I make the point that, with detention standards outlined in a contract and settled in the way it was, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission said - and I in no way mean this to reflect upon APS officers - that the quality of service that we were receiving was of a higher order than we had before when such standards were not prescribed. </DOC>

 - I can certainly assure the Leader of the Opposition and all members of the House that the terms and conditions of the resolution that was passed by the parliament last year will be honoured and supported by the government. I have received on behalf of the government - as have the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister on behalf of the National Party, and the Leader of the Democrats on behalf of the Australian Democrats - the final report of the council. It contains a number of recommendations. We will consider all of those recommendations.Without in any way wishing to walk away from the spirit that was displayed at this morning's breakfast, I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that the government has certain reservations about the concept of a treaty. What I had to say this morning was seen as a clear statement of very strong support for reconciliation. What I had to say this morning was said against the background of the views that we had previously expressed in relation to a treaty, and those views remain. But I think it is important in this whole area to do what I sensed was the desire of the members of the council this morning, and certainly of the chairman of the council, Dr Evelyn Scott, who has given dignified and very strong leadership to the reconciliation movement, and that is that we try to focus as much as we possibly can on those areas where all of us agree, and there are many areas of agreement in relation to reconciliation. It is true that there are some different views about the concept of a treaty, and I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has focused on something where we disagree but I think it is more important to focus on those things where we agree. Those things where we agree on reconciliation are much greater, more important, stronger and more enduring that those areas where we disagree.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I am quite delighted to inform the House that the final report of the World Trade Organisation panel on lamb meat has found against the United States. This is tremendous news for Australian exporters. For the first time in living memory, to my understanding, there appears to be a modicum of international trade justice for the farmers of Australia. For too long, our primary producers have laboured under a world trading order which not only has discriminated against primary producers to the benefit of those who depend more heavily on manufactured goods but, even amongst primary producers, has written the rules to advantage the Americans and the Europeans to the detriment of Australians and New Zealanders.What was done by the United States in relation to lamb was indefensible. It was the subject of very strong representations at the time, by me and the Minister for Trade, to the American administration. Those representations at a political level were of no avail; but, to his very great credit, the Minister for Trade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supporting him did not give up. I want to thank the minister - who is once again overseas doing trade business on behalf of Australia - and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the great work that they did.The WTO panel has reaffirmed its interim finding that the United States is in breach of its World Trade Organisation obligations and that the tariffs it imposed on our lamb imports are unjustified. I understand that the report will be released publicly in the next few weeks. From the beginning of this dispute, the government has been pursuing actively the vital interests of Australian lamb farmers. We have always maintained that the American measures were wrong. I understand that it is still open to the United States to appeal against the report. If it does so, Australia will vigorously defend the findings. I also make the point that, when the process of appeal has been resolved and this matter is finally concluded in Australia's favour, we will expect of the Americans immediate action to remove the unfair quotas that have been imposed on our lamb exporters - just as they required of us immediate action in relation to the Howe Leather company. This is a very important victory for Australian farmers and it is a victory they deserve. It is a recognition long denied to them that there is some justice in the international trading system, and I hope that it is seen throughout the farming community as a token of the long-term value of pursuing more open trade. In the end, the salvation of Australian exporters is in a more open, liberal world trading system. Because of our size, we cannot retreat into protection and the imposition of quotas. It is tough, it is very hard and it is very unrewarding, but in the long run a country of Australia's size will benefit more than many others from an open, liberal world trading system.</DOC>

 - I can respond to the honourable member's question by saying that there has been a very positive response indeed. She would have recognised this because her electorate embraces a very big defence area and, no doubt, her office has been getting phone calls this morning, as has mine, in response to yesterday's white paper which the Prime Minister announced. The response has particularly come from industry, who are extraordinarily appreciative of the planning and long-term commitment to investment and capability by Defence. Personnel have been overcome by calls to inquire as to what prospects there might be for new terms of engagement within the ADF. Members of the ADF have made inquiries to my office asking as to what particular benefits might be flowing to them. The general response across the board has been particularly good. I would also like to point out that the press have picked up on a couple of areas of this, and I picked up a random three quotes from the very many articles this morning that cover the Defence white paper. Firstly, the Australian carried a story by Alan Dupont under the heading `The white paper is a clear and outstanding work'. It went on to say:This is the best white paper on defence in the past 25 years. It provides a clear strategic roadmap... In the Age Tony Parkinson comments: ... the white paper is a measured document that carries no hint of ... bravado. It restores perspective to the debate.' Finally, I have read a third random sample of good news. The Financial Review editorial says:What is more significant is that the strategic planning outlook and the financial planning outlook in the new White Paper ... have more prospect of measuring up than has been the case in the past.They are just three random samples of good news and appreciation for what the Prime Minister has done with the white paper on defence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform the House that the legislative reform of the Australian taxation system will be viewed as one of the great achievements of this parliament in the year 2000. The legislative achievement in tax policy enacted by this House and this parliament this year is larger than any other tax reform or financial reform put in place in Australia. On 1 July this year, income taxes were lowered by $12 billion, and 80 per cent of Australians now face a marginal tax rate no higher than 30 per cent. From 1 July this year, families were benefited by an additional $2.4 billion in family allowances. On 1 July this year, pensions were increased by four per cent and pensioners and self-funded retirees were paid savings bonuses. From 1 July this year, Commonwealth-state relations were reformed with the greatest reform in Australian federal history when the states secured a growth revenue base of 10 per cent of GST. On 1 July this year the wholesale sales tax was abolished. As enacted this year, capital gains tax was cut in half for individuals so that they need pay capital gains tax at marginal rates on only half their gains. Small business men and farmers who had held assets for 15 years, were 55 and intended to retire were given the opportunity to sell off that asset capital gains tax free. Investment in venture capital was encouraged, and foreign funds and pension funds were given the opportunity to invest capital gains tax free. Scrip for scrip rollover relief was introduced. Company tax rates were lowered from 36 per cent to 34 per cent and will go to 30 per cent next year.  Refunds of imputation credits were introduced from 1 July 2000, and today the government introduced its simplified taxation system for small business. Not only have we implemented all of that and registered I think some three million entities with Australian business numbers but we have now received 1.6 million business activity statement returns. The level of legislative and administration change this year has been without parallel in the tax or financial area.All of Australia breathlessly awaits this Christmas the announcement of the famous roll-back policy. On the 7.30 Report on 23 February 2000, the Leader of the Opposition said:... people are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST ... They're also entitled to know exactly what we'd do in the next term of government with a GST ... People are entitled to know it and not be deceived.After making that comment on 23 February 2000, the Leader of the Opposition has done everything he can to hornswoggle to make sure that the people of Australia do not know where the Labor Party stands on GST. He has done everything he can to hornswoggle to make sure that they do not know what the Labor Party would do. He has tried to hornswoggle and deceive the Australian public about his roll-back policy. Australia now breathlessly awaits. Roll-back - the policy that the Labor Party has pledged to the people, which they are entitled to know in detail and about which they are entitled not to be deceived or hornswoggled by the Leader of the Opposition - needs to be explained. The Labor Party must put its cards on the table so we will have the opportunity to expose its lack of policy and the way in which all Australians know it has failed.</DOC>

 - I note that the Labor Party supports retrospective legislation. It is not something that as a matter of course governments have endorsed, and they certainly do not endorse it where the advice to them from their tax commissioner is that such legislation is not required. I referred yesterday to a speech from the tax commissioner on 15 November 2000. The commissioner stated there what is his advice to the government and always has been, that because a general anti-avoidance measure operates to strike down avoidance of taxation liabilities he intends to rely upon it. I also referred yesterday to his point that he has advice, which he accepts, from senior counsel as to its adequacy in dealing with these matters.We rely on and operate upon the advice of the Commissioner of Taxation. The member for Wills is well known for his personal attacks on the Commissioner of Taxation - some of the most disgraceful attacks that I have ever heard in this House. The Commissioner of Taxation I have respect for as an independent statutory officer, and I rely on his advice. The Commissioner of Taxation was first appointed by a Labor Party government that obviously, when it was in government, had confidence in him. Its attempts to now impugn his integrity are just another example of the depths to which Labor will descend.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. Everybody knows of the great interest he has taken in the bilateral relationship with Indonesia and the enthusiastic support he has provided for Australia's interests in that relationship. As the Prime Minister has already said, we very warmly welcome our colleagues, who are sitting in the gallery this afternoon, from Indonesia - the delegation which will make up the Indonesian side of the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum. We look forward to the forum beginning in the course of this afternoon and proceeding through to tomorrow.This forum takes place on top of some 10 ministerial visits this year in both directions between Australia and Indonesia. The forum does epitomise the breadth of our relations, bringing together on this occasion 16 Australian and Indonesian ministers who oversee the work of 10 specialised working groups covering areas as diverse as legal cooperation, education, mining and energy, and health. This dialogue is underpinned by, and it is intended to encourage, the very strong and growing people-to-people links between Australia and Indonesia. We have around 18,000 Indonesian students now studying in Australia, and during the last year our bilateral merchandise trade has grown by about eight per cent to $5.3 billion.It is well known that over the last couple of years we have had some differences with Indonesia, but it is important that the differences that we have be kept in a mature perspective. We do share a fundamental congruence of interests in the security and the prosperity of our region. Indonesia's territorial integrity, which we fully support, its prosperity and its respect for the rights of all its people are central to the achievement of this objective. We are committed to working with Indonesia to develop the relationship further on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect. As was affirmed yesterday in the white paper, we are committed to working with Indonesia to establish over time a new defence relationship that will serve our enduring shared strategic interests. Indonesia has gone through a welcome and historic transition to a vibrant democracy. That will mean in time that the relationship between our two countries is more natural and more durable than it has been in the past.Finally, let me pay tribute both to the Prime Minister and also to President Wahid for the constructive way in which they have approached their personal relationships over the course of this year. They have met on three separate occasions and, on each of those occasions, I think have worked very constructively in the interests of an appropriate bilateral relationship.</DOC>

I do not support One Nation's approach to the difficulties being experienced in regional Australia, both real and those that they try to build up and the bogeymen that they try to present to, if you like, worry people about, and that will be always reflected in my approach to where they ought to be placed in terms of preferences. I do note, however, that I do not have total control over what state organisations do at the level of their parties. -  - I do not; it is a reality. We are not some sort of centrally controlled organisation, and I say it plainly. - We do not have a politburo. I am sorry about that, but we do not.  - And nothing I have said, can I say to the member for Batman, would imply that I would do anything other than put my case strongly and forcefully on this matter - as did the previous leader. He did it successfully; I should imagine that I will be successful in the same thing.</DOC>

 - We have had a very active year in the portfolio. To cover some transport matters to begin with, in the area of roads we are now seeing very significant new levels of investment in infrastructure. That has been highlighted by the announcement in recent days of $1.2 billion of increased funding for local roads and also $400 million for national highways and roads of national importance. In fact, that represents, as I said yesterday, a 12 per cent increase in road funding in overall terms. Indeed, next year, in 2001-02, the government's direct expenditure on road infrastructure will be around 16 per cent greater than it was under Labor, and for local roads in the next financial year we will spend 100 per cent more than Labor did in their final budget when they were in government. In aviation, we have had a very active year. We have actually seen - and it is often overlooked and easy to overlook - the transformation of the Australian aviation industry. As a result of the government's policies, Australia has two new domestic airlines successfully launched, with high load factors, and passenger movements along the east coast have increased by more than 25 per cent. At the same time we have just reached in this country our first open skies agreement, which is with New Zealand. The way in which we were able to progressively take that forward and then sign off is in stark contrast with the efforts of Laurie Brereton in the dying days of the ALP government in the way it dealt with New Zealand. It has to be said, too, that Sydney airport, including the air traffic controllers, performed magnificently during the Olympics, and they deserve recognition for it - despite the predictions of doom and gloom from the member for Batman, the old `tit for tatter' over there. Sydney airport recorded its busiest day in history on 2 October with over 1,000 arrivals and departures - all of the movements handled safely, all of them managed without changing or offending the curfew rules and all within the 80 movements per hour cap.In relation to rail, we have the Alice to Darwin railway. The Commonwealth has now formalised its $165 million contribution. Advice from the project developer is that final arrangements are to be settled before Christmas. Of course, $250 million has been dedicated to the Interstate Rail Investment Fund. With the ARTC, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the Commonwealth has now overseen a very significant improvement in the performance of the interstate rail track which is making a real difference in terms of efficiency and costs. A couple of examples are that train lengths are increasing and temporary speed restrictions are being reduced from 27 per cent in Victoria to just two per cent today over the time that we have been in government. The Melbourne to Adelaide transit times for superfreighters have now been reduced by no less than two hours. We have progressed the NR sale. We do not believe in owning above-track operations. Like road, we think we will get the best efficiencies in transport, the best economic outcomes, if we own the infrastructure and the private sector competes above that infrastructure. So NR arrangements have now been agreed with New South Wales and with Victoria for the 100 per cent sale of NRC. The inland rail, or ATEC as it is known, has now seen the Commonwealth support work by the private sector which shows that this proposal is soundly based and economically and socially beneficial. We have touched on the waterfront in this place. There were all those allegations made by the defenders of poor performance in this country that it was impossible to reach an average productivity of 25 movements an hour. As we have now heard, it is as high as 28 at some ports in Australia, and we have reached an overall average of 24.9 lifts per hour. Australia is now finally obtaining the world-class waterfront that it deserves. So, in a whole range of areas, shipping reform included, we are making real progress. In terms of our approach to regional policy, it has been a very active year. We have had the $562 million Regional Health Initiative, which will finally meaningfully address the crisis of the shortage of doctors and specialists in rural and regional Australia. I again thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care for his outstanding support and work in that regard. There has been very significant movement on assistance for education, particularly for those in isolated areas. There has been an over $300 million extension of Agriculture - Advance Australia, $45 million for the dairy assistance program and major assistance for the restructuring of the dairy industry which came about because of the movement of the Victorian industry with the support of its government. And so the list goes on.This week, because we are in a strong position to be able to do so, we were able to meet the needs of flood victims in Queensland and New South Wales with a $216 million package. In terms of our long-term approach, that brings me to the final point I want to make. We are going to tackle the insidious problem of salinity in this country - which is a problem not just for agriculture but for communications, for town councils, for housing, for recreation and for a whole range of infrastructure issues in this country - with a $1.5 billion package. This is a very meaningful, very important and very much needed approach to a very serious problem for Australia.</DOC>

 - The last 12 months have been a big year of achievement in health care in Australia. The government has achieved in five predominant areas: rural health, public sector health, the private health sector, work with the professions and public health generally. The centrepiece of this year's budget was $562 million to address chronic problems in rural health care. This means that next year we will be spending about $300 million on rural health initiatives, up from $100 million when we came into government. I expect within a couple of weeks to be able to announce the location of new clinical schools in university departments of rural health, which is a historic change that will take perhaps 20 per cent of all medical training physically out of capital cities and forever put it in rural locations. Earlier this week I went with the member for Herbert to open a new medical school at James Cook University, the first new medical school opened anywhere in Australia in 27 years. This medical school will very much contribute to the future health needs of North Queensland.  In public sector health, this year state governments had $6.3 billion of funding from the federal government, up $1.3 billion in just 2½ years since the last year of the previous Labor government's health care agreement. That is a 17 per cent increase in funding and an amount of money that is unprecedented at any time during the Medicare health care agreements. In terms of the private health care sector, we have been very successful with lifetime health cover and the 30 per cent rebate. There are 8.8 million Australians now in private health insurance, an increase of 50 per cent over what it was a bit over 12 months previously. No-gap products have taken off at a rate that has been unimaginable and 60 per cent of all in-hospital services are now covered by no gap whatsoever. These, again, are chronic problems that have not been able to be addressed by previous governments. In working with the professions, we now have agreement with the Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges for fast track arrangements for getting specialist doctors into areas of need - something that has been a problem for more than 20 years. We signed the third five-year pharmacy agreement, which will enhance the professional role of pharmacy and we have set up a general practice training board that is the biggest change in general practice training since the family medicine program started 30 years ago. In public health, just in the last 12 months we have had major trials on bowel cancer, the National Depression Initiative and the National Child Nutrition Program. This year for the first time everyone over 65 got an influenza vaccine free and we have had a full phase-out of all tobacco advertising in Australia - something that no other country has been able to negotiate with international motor sport anywhere in the world.I contrast this with the normal carping, negative, whingeing bleating we get from the opposition. The opposition can be measured by their own standards. In July 1999 the opposition promised that by July 2000 they would have key policy achievements in areas of health. Let me read out to honourable members where the opposition said they would have detailed policies by July 2000.  - They promised detailed policies to develop a publicly funded coordinated care program to supplement Medicare for the elderly. We have not seen anything. They promised to overcome major inequities in our health system with programs targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have seen nothing whatsoever. They promised to tackle the special needs of mental health - not a single policy idea. They promised to focus on health promotion and early intervention to reduce the long-term financial burden of ill-health. We have seen nothing whatsoever in that area. They promised to control the rising cost of medicine by ensuring that technology is used effectively - no ideas on that either. They promised greater access to information for consumers using the opportunities of new technology. So in their own areas, five months after they promised they would be in, the opposition have been completely unable to come up with any policy idea. It could be laziness. It could just be complete lack of ability.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I am aware of the reports in the newspaper today of the statements made by Amnesty yesterday. The first point I would make quite strongly in relation to this matter is that Amnesty conceded in today's Australian newspaper that these allegations are uncorroborated. I have said on a number of occasions - and I said it before - that when allegations involve children I take them seriously. - The point I make very strongly in relation to these matters is that there is a determined campaign at the moment by some people who want to unwind contractual arrangements and by others who want to unwind the mandatory detention arrangements. That is quite clear. The campaign has been going on for some time, and it is quite a malicious campaign which has been designed to demonise the people who have a job to do in relation to the detention policy. One of the points that I would make very strongly is that their task is not easy. There are some people involved who are innocents, but there are others who have quite malicious intent. - One of the points I would make about the situation is that we have Australians who are carrying out the detention task unarmed. These are not jails. If they were jails, there would be arms available to secure the facilities. We have a situation in which some people are deliberately involved in intimidating the staff. We have had weapons that have been manufactured - and I will table information for honourable members - in the detention centres, which evidences very significantly some of the threats that the Australian staff have to endure. -  - Some of the staff are women employed by Australian Correctional Services. As I said before, they are unarmed with a job to do. One of the concerns I have is that this debate that you are progressing with unsubstantiated allegations and uncorroborated allegations, which I will deal with in greater detail in a moment, is changing very significantly the way in which detainees act in relation to the people who have these responsibilities. It is a matter on which there are people making very deliberate and very mischievous allegations, and they have been doing it for some time.  -  - I act when there is evidence on which there should be action, and I make that very clear. Let me deal with these matters, if I may, because these allegations are uncorroborated. The point I have made over a period of time is that anyone who has substantial information on abuse should make it available to appropriate authorities, and that includes the Ombudsman. The process of inquiries in relation to these matters is ongoing. The first matter is that children were allegedly being transported to Port Hedland and were not given food for 32 hours and one had leg restraints applied to him. Let me just make it clear: we have no leg restraints. We do have handcuffs, but leg restraints just do not exist and children under 16 are not restrained, even with handcuffs. -  - First of all, the allegation is that children were being transported to Port Hedland, were not being given food for 32 hours and had leg restraints applied. I made the point that there are no leg restraints.  - It made reference to the allegations by Amnesty yesterday. That was the first allegation made. Further in relation to that matter, there has been no child restrained using leg restraints. These allegations have been raised before and no case has been identified. The reason no case has been identified is that there is no evidence of it ever happening.Let me deal with the food. Children were transported to Port Hedland from Villawood after there had been a significant hunger strike over a period of time which had become significantly unmanageable, and there were people outside the detention centre on megaphones and microphones encouraging them to deliberately behave in this way. That is what was happening, and it was necessary, in order to ensure the safety of other individuals who were involved - particularly the children who were involved in the hunger strike, which involved them being deprived of food for very much longer than 32 hours - for the groups to be broken up. Some were taken to Port Hedland, some were taken to Woomera, some were taken to Maribyrnong in Melbourne and some were relocated to Villawood in Sydney. Those who were transported to Port Hedland were given food. They were given food on the plane, but it was not partaken of in some cases by the children because the children were asleep. But the food was there. In relation to the time when they arrived at Port Hedland, further food was available to them. That provision was made at the time they arrived. It is very clear that that allegation has absolutely no substance.There was an allegation that a four-year-old girl at Maribyrnong suffered a broken wrist and waited two weeks before being X-rayed. If such an event had occurred, it would be well remembered. But neither the centre manager nor the ACM manager can recall any such incident taking place. They have checked all medical records and are continuing to check those medical records to see whether or not there is any substance in it. In relation to the further allegation that an 11-year-old girl and her father were kept in a confined space at the Woomera immigration reception and processing centre, the interview with Carolyn Graydon of Amnesty International seems to indicate that this was the secure compound, but details are unclear. The media notes that the allegation has been brought to the attention of the Ombudsman. Let me just say in relation to that that this fits the description of an 11-year-old Iraqi girl with her father who were in Woomera and that they have never been confined with 22 other men. - They have never been confined with other men. Let me make this point clear: some very precise and specific allegations were brought forward in relation to the abuse of children, which were investigated by the police and by Family and Youth Services. In relation to each of those matters, the investigations confirmed that there was no necessity for the children involved to be taken into care - in other words, there was no evidence available of abuse upon which any charges could be brought or that would require separate arrangements to be made for the care of those children.We are inquiring into one specific matter, and we will know the outcome of the inquiry fairly shortly, because there will be a result from South Australia's Family and Youth Services. We will know the answer and I am reasonably confident as to what that answer will be, but I am not going to suggest that at this stage, because the inquiries are still afoot. But we will know. Because we were acting on good faith, we made one document available to the state department and the state department said: `We haven't seen that document before. We'd like to reopen the inquiry to have a further look at it.' That is the substantial issue and it relates to one specific incident, one specific document. That is the matter into which Mr Flood is inquiring. I do not regard it as satisfactory that a document that the state department thought was sufficiently important to have before them was not available at that time. That is why that investigation is being undertaken at the moment. Today, I further announced in relation to that that assistance will be provided to those people identified as having information which would assist the Flood inquiry. This assistance scheme has been set up to facilitate the provision of information from people identified by Mr Flood as perhaps having information which he believes is central to his inquiry. It will enable anyone who feels that they have information that they wish to make available to feel confident in putting forward that information to the inquiry. The scheme will cover reasonable costs of independent advice for them. I make the further point that any employee of the department or ACM who wishes to deal with Mr Flood and who has information to provide to him will be in no way restricted by any of the confidentiality provisions that were designed for another purpose, and the other purpose was simply to ensure that individuals making protection claims do not have their identity disclosed in ways which might jeopardise them or their families. That was the purpose of the confidentiality provisions and they were certainly very appropriate. The inquiry that is being undertaken is appropriate to the circumstances. The information that was given by Amnesty adds nothing.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Grey knows, as all those who represent rural and regional Australia know, how important it is for rural industries to prosper if country communities are to grow strong. Indeed, the very best way that we can revitalise regional Australia is to strengthen its most important industry, and that is agriculture. This government has a very sound record of achievement, particularly during the last 12 months, which we look back on at the end of this parliamentary year with a degree of pride. The new tax system has delivered significant benefits to farmers. It has substantially reduced their costs.Over 70 per cent of primary producers will now be paying 17c in the dollar or less in income tax and their in-built costs will be reduced by this government's actions in relation to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax system and reductions in other elements of tax. The very fact that this government has repaid $50 billion worth of Labor's debt has meant lower interest rates, and that is particularly good news for farmers who are seeking to expand their production or, indeed, who need to meet the heavy costs associated with running a farm in this day and age. It has been independently estimated that the new tax system will result in savings of something like $5,500 for a medium grazing business and $18,000 for a cropping partnership. So those are very real benefits.But there have been other specific measures that this government has implemented during the past year to assist farmers. The AAA package provides a range of support for Australian farmers. The Farm Family Restart Scheme has assisted 4,000 people in agriculture. Some 30,000 have benefited from education and training programs through FarmBis. This year's budget provided another $300-plus million boost to those programs. We have introduced the new innovation in agriculture program, and the innovation council is having its first meeting in Canberra this week. So there has been a lot of work done in developing export markets and the opportunities that arise. The budget also provided additional funding for animal and plant health initiatives and continued the activities of the Natural Heritage Trust. We have been able to provide specific assistance to the sugar industry, the dairy industry, the pig industry and the sheep industry. We have provided a particular package in regard to the flooding that has occurred in New South Wales. The measures we have taken in relation to the lamb industry have particularly borne fruit today. The pretty lousy deal that Labor did in the WTO in relation to agriculture has provided very few benefits indeed to Australian farmers. At last now, as a result of the activities of the government, we have been able to redress some of the imbalance in that agreement as it affected agriculture in relation to lamb.   -  - The honourable member also asked whether there are any alternative policies. Opposition members are interjecting vigorously at the present time. Usually the noise is a demonstration that there are no alternative policies. That is abundantly clear. In fact, I have looked back in the past year, and the shadow minister for agriculture, who does not get much of a say when it comes to policy issues in the Labor caucus, has only asked me three questions in the entire year, and none of those were about policy matters. It is clear that Labor has no interest in policy. There has been no policy statement by the shadow minister on agriculture. He did not get a slot at the ALP conference in Hobart. Basically, there has been no interest in agricultural issues.There has been the odd comment on agricultural issues. The Leader of the Opposition said that, when it comes to spending money on the environment and the Natural Heritage Trust, it is a waste. Labor considers any money spent on rural heritage is a waste. When it comes to roads, that it is useless and unnecessary. -  - There has certainly been no policy activity whatsoever from Labor. It has been a classic case of the success of roll-back. They have rolled back their policy effort absolutely; it does not exist. </DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Lowe, he is aware, as somebody who holds an electorate in Sydney, that the question of the future airport needs of Sydney is something that has challenged governments of both political persuasions over a long period of time. - I do not mind saying to the member for Lowe that it is not an easy issue. When the Labor Party was in office, it did not find it an easy issue. Whatever option is chosen, the constituents in different electorates have different views. Your constituents have certain views about the matter -  - By his reaction, the member for Lowe merely confirms the point I make. I represent people who had some strong views about the policies that were followed previously. There is a very strong argument in favour of the utilisation of Badgerys Creek. On the other hand, the evidence available to the government indicates there is very strong resistance - from not only the airlines but also many travellers, people who use aircraft frequently - to the use of Badgerys Creek. The question of the expansion of Bankstown is seen by many regional commuters as presaging the day when they might lose the convenience of being able to fly into Kingsford Smith.  The government is examining all options in relation to this issue. That is why I said what I said yesterday - that I was not going to rule something out. It is an easy question for the member for Lowe to ask, as indeed it is an easy question for a lot of other people to ask. I want to say to the honourable gentleman that my recollection is that I indicated that something substantive would be said about this issue before Christmas. That still remains my intention. I do not pretend that it is an easy issue. We are looking at all the options. I would say to the honourable member and to all other members who are interested in this issue that, no matter what decision is ultimately taken, there will be a section of the community that will be unhappy with that decision. In relation to the issue of the curfew, I want to make it clear that it remains the firm policy of this government to maintain the curfew. In relation to noise sharing, it remains the view of this government that there should be a fair sharing of the noise burden among the people who live in Sydney. We do not believe, as some have believed in the past, that that burden of noise should be loaded onto one section of the community, with other sections of the community exempted.The other point that I would make to the honourable member, and I think it is something that is often lost sight of in this debate, is that we are very fortunate that the major international gateway into Australia - that is, Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the principal airport which people wish to fly into when visiting this country for the first time - happens conveniently and very beneficially to be located very close to the central business district. I happen to see that as an asset and not as a liability. It is an asset that we should try to expand, preserve and augment rather than, over time, plan to move away from. For that reason I see a continuing role for Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. There are different ways of augmenting it and we are not ruling anything out. I think it would be unwise and contrary to good public policy to do so.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Bradfield. I know he has done a fantastic job in his chairmanship of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations and he has a very active interest in family and community services. I have got to say that the achievements of the Howard-Anderson government in the last year are certainly far more significant and far reaching than in the 13 years of Labor. As the Treasurer mentioned earlier, $2.4 billion extra has been given to two million families through tax reform. Pensions have been increased by four per cent this year. Pensioners are $28 a fortnight better off than if the Australian Labor Party had been in government. We have increased rent assistance by a maximum of 10 per cent. An extra $100 million has gone out in rent assistance this year. We have simplified the family tax payments, reducing the number of payments from 12 to three. The three payments are extraordinarily generous. With the tax cuts and the increase in family assistance, the Howard-Anderson government has delivered an extra $50 a fortnight for average families. We have delivered $900 million more in child care.There now are over 560 family assistance offices and over 1,000 Centrelink offices to provide services to both urban and regional Australia. For older Australians it will be interesting if the Labor Party chooses to roll back the savings bonus which they are terribly critical of: 1.8 million Australians have now received the aged persons savings bonus; 59 per cent have received in excess of $1,000 and 74 per cent have received in excess of $500; 233,000 self-funded retirees have received the supplementary bonus. Will the Australian Labor Party roll this back, particularly in regional and rural Australia? Moving on to youth allowance, from 1 July this year 75 per cent of farm and business assets will be exempt from the parenting means test - a very good initiative for parents in regional Australia. I have to say that Centrelink is doing a terrific job not only in delivering the sugar industry assistance package but also in delivering the flood relief package. There is also our stronger families and stronger communities package: $240 million. I compliment the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, on the welfare reform to which the government is absolutely committed. We will be delivering on that soon. What is Labor's record? What have they been doing to assist Australia? Absolutely nothing. Everybody is bored with Labor - there is no question about that. Did Labor support tax reform? No. Did they support it for older Australians? No - even the old boondoggler over there. Of course there was no support. - The only roll-back that has been going on is in Queensland where members of the Labor Party have been rolling over.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Dobell that, yes, I have seen press reports about some schools in Melbourne raising their fees. They have been forced to raise these fees year after year as a result of the school funding policy that the Labor Party put in place. The school funding policy that applies to these schools at the moment is, in fact, the school funding policy which has forced many schools in Australia to raise their fees because, as soon as schools take the trouble to become well resourced and parents contribute to those schools, the Labor Party policy is that resources should be withdrawn from those schools by the government - they should be penalised and parents who invest in education should have a financial penalty imposed on them. The operation of that policy year after year has forced up school fees around Australia. Under the legislation currently before the Senate, there is a very strong incentive to lower fees and to keep fees down. For the first time we will see increasing pressure on all schools to open their doors more and more widely to parents in the lower socioeconomic levels. We have already seen a number of schools, including indeed some of the schools which have been forced this year by your policy to raise fees, that have made it clear that, when our policy is in operation, they will be reducing fees. That will be welcomed by parents. I say to the Labor Party that they should pass this legislation through the Senate as soon as possible to give the help to needier schools and needier families that they have long deserved. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. It is good news this Christmas for kids. It is good news for parents. Toys are going to be more than five per cent cheaper this Christmas as a result of the GST. Last year under the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax, toys were taxed at 22 per cent - kiddies toys at 22 per cent. -  - We are talking about kids toys, here. Last year Australians spent $1.4 billion on toys. - Around 60 per cent of this money was spent at Christmas time. In fact, every household in the country spent $195 on toys last year. With the introduction of the GST, Australians have saved $78 million in cheaper toys - 5½ per cent cheaper. For example, when the member for Dunkley goes to Toy Kingdom in Langwarrin he will find that Tonka toys are cheaper. - He can start on the Scoresby corridor. When the member for McEwen goes to Toy World in Seymour he will find that toys are 5½ per cent cheaper. At Toys 'R' Us at Garden City in the member for Moreton's electorate they are 5½ per cent cheaper - and at the well patronised Bundaberg Toy World in the member for Hinkler's electorate they are 5½ per cent cheaper. At Moss Vale Toys and Sports in Gilmore toys are 5½ per cent cheaper. Super Toys in Bateman's Bay in Eden-Monaro will be cheaper. At all of these, including All Occasions Toys and Gifts in Engadine in the member for Hughes's electorate - they might even have something for the Labor Party - toys will be 5½ per cent cheaper. Board games have come down 5.1 per cent - Monopoly, Scrabble, Guess Who? Construction toys, Tonka toys and Lego - some members on the front bench over there will enjoy this one - have come down 9.4 per cent. Dolls and Barbie dolls - you can imagine the Christmas tree at the Labor Party headquarters all stacked up with Barbie dolls and GI Joes, all with enrolment forms, all ready to change their names. They will be ready because they will be cheaper this Christmas. This is great news for Australian families. The kids are the winners out of this. Merry Christmas to everyone because the government has delivered cheaper toys this Christmas.</DOC>
